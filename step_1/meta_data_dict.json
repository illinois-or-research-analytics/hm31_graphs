Our response to this challenge has led to a program combining physician monitoring of 5% and generic monitoring of 100% of nuclear medicine studies. The described approach is reasonable, easily achievable, and improves nuclear medicine care."

        "article_title": "The management of acute coronary insufficiency.",
        "abstract": "1. Coronary insufficiency is a pathophysiologic state that can initiate lethal cardiac arrhythmias in the absence of myocardial necrosis. Patients with suspected coronary insufficiency should be monitored until they are stabilized and a diagnosis is confirmed. 2. Early and adequate intravenous antiarrhythmic prophylaxis with lidocaine to raise the fibrillation threshold in the setting of coronary insufficiency can prevent primary ventricular fibrillation. Classic \"warning arrhythmias\" are not predictive of ventricular fibrillation. Their persistence during adequate antifibrillatory prophylaxis does not indicate therapeutic failure. 3. The isoenzyme of creatine phosphokinase, CPK-MB, is an extremely sensitive and specific indicator of myocardial necrosis if measured serially during the 24 hours following the onset of symptoms suggesting coronary insufficiency. It may prove most useful in eliminating the false positive diagnosis of myocardial infarction in difficult clinical cases. 4. The management of heart failure in myocardial infarction requires an understanding of the relationship between ventricular preload and the cardiac output. The treatment of clinical manifestations of an elevated ventricular preload in asymptomatic patients is not justified and may be detrimental. In symptomatic patients, however, judicious manipulation of ventricular preload should be the first therapeutic consideration, and an optimal filling pressure should be achieved and maintained when other determinants of the cardiac output are manipulated. 5. Indications for the prophylactic insertion of a temporary transvenous pacing electrode for heart block associated with myocardial infarction must be individualized. Most authorities agree that prophylactic pacing may be justified in patients with evidence of new infranodal block involving two of the three fascicles. Patients with bifascicular block who progress to complete heart block transiently may benefit from permanent transvenous pacemaker insertion before discharge. 6. Hospitalized patients with persistent pain of suspected cardiac origin but without evidence of myocardial infarction can be studied safely with coronary angiography. A small percentage will be normal or have diffuse disease that is inoperable. Of those with operable disease, short-term mortality appears to be similar for medical and surgical therapy. 7. Patients with an uncomplicated myocardial infarction may be safely discharged from thehospital by day 7-10. 8. Experimental evidence indicates that modification of infarct size is possible. Application of these concepts to human subjects presently is limited by the absence of a proved method of measuring infarct size in vivo in humans."

        "abstract": "The effect of naloxone on brain morphine concentrations was measured in naive and morphine-dependent mice using radioimmunoassay and gas-liquid chromatography. No displacement of morphine from the brain by naloxone could be observed in naive mice acutely injected with morphine or in pellet-implanted mice at increasing intervals after removal of the morphine pellets. The suggestion of a change in affinity of opiate receptors during the development of tolerance/dependence, which had been made on the basis of the displacement of morphine by naloxone found by other workers, is thus not supported by the present results."

All these enzymes also exist in the basal ganglia. The Na+ +K+-ATPase level was elevated (p less than 0.05) in Huntington's disease, while no significant changes were observed in the other enzymes. This finding is consistent with the concept that Huntington's disease is associated with a general membrane abnormality."

        "abstract": "When considered strictly from the viewpoint of actions on the myocardium, the number of drugs falling into this category is limited, but the resulting conditions may be serious. The prototype for cardiac toxicity is the group of antimitotic drugs (adriamycin or daunomycin). If these drugs are used; frequent and careful follow-up is necessary, the dosage at which the drug becomes cumulative must be known; and patients with a pre-existing cardiac condition must be exluded from treatment. Above all, it is essential not to wait until asystole occurs, but to try to prevent such occurrences by monitoring the patient electrocardiographically. A part from these drugs, recent articles in the literature suggest that similar care should be taken when prescribing emetine and lithium salts. There is insufficient information about other drugs which may have a certain degree of cardiotoxicity. For this reason, it is most important to gather information on accidents and reaction during treatment."

It was shown that NPV polyhedra of Bombyx mori, Galleria mellonella, P. dispar, and M. brassicae contain a protease. During dissolution of the polyhedra at pH 10,5 this protease specifically cleaves the matrix protein into 2--5 fragments. The amino acid compositions of NPV polyhedral proteins of P. dispar, M. brassicae, A. crataegi, Hyphantria cunae were shown to be very similar. It was found that tyrosine is a C-terminal amino acid of NPV polyhedral proteins of P. dispar, M. brassicae, and A. crataegi."

The average interrater agreement was 57% for DSM-II and 54% for axis I (clinical psychiatric syndrome) of DSM-III. There was high agreement in both systems on cases of psychosis, conduct disorder, hyperactivity, and mental retardation, with DSM-III appearing slightly better. There was noteworthy interrater disagreement in both systems for \"anxiety\" disorders, complex cases, and in the subtyping of depression. Overall, the reliability of DSM-III appears to be good and is comparable with that of DSM-II and other classification systems of childhood psychiatric disorders."

Most (88%) sputa showed definite evidence of oropharyngeal contamination, whereas bronchial washings showed much less frequent (21%) contamination. Culture results of the same specimens showed that yeasts (excluding dimorphic fungi) were recovered from 74% of the sputa and 25% of the bronchial washings. It seems that microscopic evidence of oropharyngeal contamination is a reliable index for predicting the presence of yeasts in respiratory secretions. Their presence in cultures of respiratory secretions probably represents \"normal flora\" except for Cryptococcus neoformans, and their routine identification is not warranted."

        "abstract": "1. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the effects of maternal hyperoxaemia and hypercapnia on the uterine vascular bed and foetal oxygenation in the large white sow at 80-90 days gestation. 2. When maternal hyperoxaemia was induced with 100% oxygen, there was a highly significant rise in the maternal arterial oxygen tension, but no other significant blood gas or vascular changes were observed. 3. When mild maternal hypercapnia was superimposed on maternal hyperoxaemia (oxygen plus 6% carbon dioxide), the oxygen tension and saturation of both the maternal uterine venous and foetal umbilical venous bloods were found when severe hypercapnia was induced (oxygen plus 50% carbon dioxide) but in this case all blood samples showed dramatic changes in PCO2 and pH. These changes were accompanied by an increase in the systemic blood pressure and uterine blood flow, and a decrease in uterine vascular resistance. 4. When mild hypercapnia was induced without hyperoxaemia (air plus 5% carbon dioxide) significant increases were recorded in the oxygen tension and saturation of uterine venous and foetal umbilical venous bloods. Systemic and uterine vascular resistance fell. 5. It was concluded that the increased foetal oxygen tension during maternal hypercapnia was the result of the increased uterine blood flow and greater mass delivery of oxygen to the placenta, so that once the oxygen requirements of the placental tissues themselves were exceeded there would be an increased oxygen gradient at the site of gas exchange. 6. Carbon dioxide concentration in arterial blood plays an important role in determining blood flow through the pregnant uterus in the sow."

The method is sensitive and reproducible and shows good correlation with a conventional specific assay for prothrombin. The reaction is dependent on calcium ions and phospholipid, and is therefore sensitive to the coumarin-induced prothrombin defect. The assay is rapid and well suited for use in the routine coagulation laboratory."

        "abstract": "Forty-four mutants of Alcaligenes eutrophus H 16 were isolated which grew poorly or not at all under autotrophic conditions. Four types were characterized with respect to their defects and their physiological properties. One mutant lacked both enzymes specific for autotrophic CO2 fixation, another one lacked both hydrogenases, and two mutants lacked either the membrane-bound or the soluble hydrogenase. Comparing the results of studies on these mutant types, the following conclusions were drawn: the lack of each hydrogenase enzyme could be partially compensated by the other one; the lack of membrane-bound hydrogenase did not affect autotrophic growth, whereas the lack of the soluble hydrogenase resulted in a decreased autotrophic growth rate. When pyruvate as well as hydrogen were supplied to the wild-type, the cell yield was higher than in the presence of pyruvate alone. Mutant experiments under these conditions indicated that either of both hydrogenases was able to add to the energy supply of the cell. Only the soluble hydrogenase was involved in the control of the rate of hydrogen oxidation by carbon dioxide; the mutant lacking this enzyme did not respond to the presence or absence of CO2. The suppression of growth on fructose by hydrogen could be mediated by either of both hydrogenases alone."

        "abstract": "Female CBA mice, aged 11 months, were treated cyclically with oral ethynyl oestradiol or oestrone sulphate for 3 months. The ovaries of all animals appeared to be atrophied. Target tissues throughout the genital tract showed a response to both oestrogens. Electron microscopy of both the endometrium and the urothelium demonstrated morphological changes characteristic of increased cellular metabolic activity in the treated mice. Endometrial hyperplasia developed in both treatment groups but more pronounced epithelial changes occurred with oestrone sulphate. This hyperplasia was accompanied by a doubling in the number of uterine cytoplasmic oestrogen receptors. A 50% fall in serum levels of luteinizing hormone in the treated mice revealed that the hypothalamic-pituitary system was still intact. Both oestrogens improved skeletal balance by changes in cortical-endosteal bone remodelling. The results suggest that the CBA strain of mouse is a suitable model for the study of the human climacteric and its response to hormone replacement therapy."

Instead, corticosterone (3 mg kg-1) had a significant anxiolytic effect in the social interaction test of anxiety. Adrenalectomized rats had very low levels of social interaction; but adrenalectomized rats that had been given replacement corticosterone therapy did not differ from the sham-operated controls. Thus, corticosterone appears to have the opposite effect to that previously reported for ACTH. Possible mechanisms for the observed results are discussed."

This surgical procedure resulted in the isolation of the frontal sinus, without impairing the integrity of the cavity. In this experimental canine model, potassium penicillin G and erythromycin lactobionate were absorbed into the blood equally well when placement was either in the intramuscular (IM) space or in frontal sinus cavity. When different concentrations of these antibiotics were injected into the IM space, peak blood levels occurred between one and two hours; however, peak sinus levels, following IM introduction, did not occur until four hours. The peak ratios show that between 4% and 20% of penicillin, and 1% and 12% of erythromycin in the blood is transferred across the normal sinus membrane."

The melting temperature of poly(A).poly(U) in low-salt buffer is increased by 6 degrees C in the presence of [(terpy)Pt(HET)]+, indicating stabilization of the duplex structure by the bound platinum reagent. Viscosity measurements provide evidence for comparable lengthening of the polynucleotide in the presence of [(terpy)Pt(HET)]+ and the intercalating dye, ethidium bromide. Scatchard plots of the binding of [(terpy)Pt(HET)]+ to poly(A).poly(U) and poly(I).poly(C), determined through ultracentrifugation pelleting methods, show large positive curvature, reflecting the strong cooperativity associated with the platinum complex-RNA interaction. The characteristics of the binding isotherms are interpreted in terms of a model where cooperative pair units of [(terpy)Pt(HET)]+ intercalate into the double-stranded polymer. At saturation, two platinum molecules are bound for every three base pairs. This stoichiometry may be compared with the nearest-neighbor-exclusion binding observed previously in the interaction of [(terpy)Pt(HET)]+ and the ethidium cation with DNA, in which one intercalator occupies every other interbase-pair site at saturation. The striking differences observed in the interaction of [(terpy)Pt(HET)]+ with DNA and RNA suggest that drug recognition is sensitive to the constraints imposed by nucleic acid secondary structure."

        "abstract": "Results reported by 113 participants in the Blood Lead Proficiency Testing Program conducted by the Center for Disease Control were compared with those obtained by the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) with a definitive methods (mass spectroscopy-isotopic dilution) for blood lead analyses. Data were compiled from the results obtained for 12 whole-blood samples containing 1.5 g of disodium EDTA per liter. Twelve separate blood samples were obtained from cattle which had been given lead nitrate orally. Lead concentrations in the samples ranged from 0.628 to 4.93 mumol/L (130-1020 micrograms/L) as determined by NBS. The methods used by laboratories were classified according to six basic groups: anodic stripping voltametry; and atomic absorption spectroscopy in which either extraction, carbon rod, graphite furnace, tantalum strip, or Delves cup was used. For results obtained in each group a linear regression analyses of laboratory values was made on the basis of NBS values. In comparison to the definitive method, most field methods for blood lead tended to overestimate the lead concentration when the actual lead concentration was less than 1.96 mumol/L (400 micrograms/L) and to underestimate the lead concentration when the actual lead concentration was greater than 2.45 mumol/L (500 micrograms/L)."

        "abstract": "The major factor that controls glycogen metabolism in the liver is the concentration of phorphorylase alpha. Indeed, this enzyme catalyzes the limiting step of glycogen breakdown and, by controlling the activity of synthetase phosphatase, also regulates glycogen synthesis. The formation of phosphorylase alpha is stimulated by cAMP, by glycogen, and presumably also by some still ill-defined ionic changes. The ininactivation of phosphorylase is greatly stimulated by glucose and inhibited by AMP and glycogen. Glycogen synthesis is proportional to the concentration of synthetase alpha, which in normally fed animals is formed only when most of the phosphorylase is in the beta form. The inactivation of glycogen synthetase is stimulated by cAMP, an elevated concentration of which puts a double lock on glycogen synthetase by activating phosphorylase alpha (and thereby preventing synthetase activation) and by inactivating glycogen synthetase. The effect of cAMP, 5'-AMP, glucose, and glycogen can presently be explained in molecular terms. The main missing link is in the ionic effect whose elucidation might lead to the understanding of the mode of action of insulin."

The angulations are obtained with a variety of equipment rotating about different axes. The planes and axes in and about which the patient and equipment rotate are defined and the equipment is grouped according to the axes about which it rotates. It is shown that a simple definition of the angulation of a projection may be obtained using concepts and terminology consistent with current radiological practice. One group of equipment then gives directly from the rotation of its component parts the angles specifying the projection. For other equipment, the angles specifying the projection are calculated and tabulated for angles of rotation of the equipment from 0 to 90 degrees. Thus, equivalent projections for the different equipment may be found and compared."

In this study IgA was demonstrated in all of the investigated commercial gamma-globulin preparations. In the material from a few producers it was, however, very low. By immuno-gel filtration it could be shown that the IgA consisted of aggregates as well as a 7S component and fragments. By immunoelectrophoresis-immunofluorescence IgG-IgA complexes could also be detected. The IgA aggregates could be almost completely degraded by reduction-alkylation. It is implied that such changed IgA in gamma-globulin preparations for injection may increase the risk of immunization against IgA."

Fifteen of them were premature and one at full term. Management consisted of the accepted medical and ventilatory aids such as digitalis, diuretics, ventilators, etc. Thirteen cases were given indomethacin with clinical closure in five of them (38%). Ten cases underwent surgical closure with 30% mortality. It is recommended that these patients be given indomethacin inicially; if there is no response in 36 hours surgical closure of the duct should be performed prior to progressive deterioration and eventual death."

IgE levels of the AED group were elevated above those of a control group at the p=0.01 level of significance. In vivo methods utilizing the application of DNCB demonstrated, in addition, decreased delayed hypersensitivity reactions in the anhidrotic patients. Thus there appears to be some degree of cellular immune hypofunction in patients with AED, all of whom have demonstrated at some time a lichenified dermatitis clinically indistinguishable from atopic dermatitis."

This makes possible the direct observation of ESR spectra of the intermediate radical state of the enzyme when interacting with the substrate. We have shown that these radicals are really observable. Using the reversibility of the reaction and an equilibrium shift the amount of radicals can be increased up to 10% of all flavin groups present. The dependence of the radicals concentration on the amount of substrate and product can be predicted. The theory is confirmed by experimental data."

        "abstract": "In the Cambridge renal transplant unit percutaneous needle biopsies of renal transplants have been extensively used to help identify the cause of impaired allograft function. During the period 1966--1973, 154 of the 269 renal allografts transplanted were biopsied at least once during the first 90 days after transplantation. In this survey the relationship between morphological changes in these biopsy specimens and allograft function 1, 3 and 5 years after transplantation is assessed. A highly significant direct relationship exists between early graft failure and the presence of medial necrosis of arteries, acute glomerular lesions and interstitial haemorrhage. Less than 10% of grafts with one or more of these changes and none in which all three types of lesion were present were capable of supporting life at 1 year. There is a significant association between poor subsequent graft function and mononuclear cell infiltration of the intima of arteries. No clear relationship exists, however, between the function of grafts at 1 and 3 years and the degree of mononuclear cell infiltration of the interstitial tissue. Tubular necrosis was frequently observed and future graft performance is related to the extent and cause of the tubular damage."

        "abstract": "The duration of the latent period of RSV was studied in unsynchronized chicken cells using two methods. First, RAV1-producing cells were infected with Schmidt-Ruppin strain of Rous sarcoma virus (SR-RSV;subgroup D), and new virions of SR-RSV (subgroup A) produced after phenotypic mixing with RAV1 were neutralized with an antiserum to RAV1. Secondly, uninfected chicken cells were infected with SR-RSV (D) in the presence of either arabionsylcytosine, actinomycin D or cycloheximide, to inhibit the virus production. In both methods, the early decrease of the virus titer showed that new virions were produced as early as 45 min after the beginning of the infection. Earlier times were not explored."

        "abstract": "A study has been carried out on the coupling of proteins onto crosslinked poly(vinyl alcohol) hydrogel membranes and ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer(EVA) films previously grafted with oxidized starches having many pendant aldehyde groups. The coupling reaction of proteins is based on the Schiff's base formation between the amino groups of proteins and the aldehyde groups of the oxidized starches which have been grafted onto the substrate membrane or film through acetalization of the aldehyde of starch with hydroxyl groups of the substrate polymers. The grafting of oxidized starches onto the EVA films seems to be restricted to the film surface, since no detectable change is observed in the weight and the attenuated total reflection infrared spectrum of the grafted films. The amount of grafted protein, determined by the ninhydrin method, reveals that, at least, plasma proteins such as serum albumin and fibrinogen are grafted to the film surface in a monomolecular layer without undergoing a marked denaturation. The alpha-amylase grafted onto the EVA film showed a distinct enzymatic activity in hydrolysis of amylose and starch, but the activity was very low compared with that of the ungrafted, soluble alpha-amylase."

The mid-point of the upper margin of the symphysis is selected as the origin of the co-ordinates. The markings of the uterus are placed through the laparoscope with silver clips. The markings in the urinary bladder are placed close to the ureteral orifices through the cytoscope. The doses of radiation generated by the sources of radiation (tubes, colpostat, vaginal cylinder, cervical plate) can with this new marking technique not only be measured experimentally in anatomically well-defined points in the body but the dosage (the energy) can be calculated by the computer. In as many points in the body as desired. The maximal permissable dosage in the tumor can be determined with special consideration for the avoidance of radiation lesions to marked adjacent points such as the ureteral orifices."

The procedure alters the condyle position and will indirectly shorten the lateral pterygoid muscle, thus eliminating its pulling power to the condyle, even though it still functions. For the study, a late examination was performed with at least 1 year's follow-up. Seventeen patients were cured after unilateral or bilateral condylotomies, and two patients were asked to undergo a second operation on the opposite side. In normal cases any joint operated on was cured. Two cases suffering from congenital torticollis or disseminated sclerosis were felt to be unsuccessful. One exceptional case resulted in a pseudarthrosis, and was repaired by rib bone cartilage transplant. The method is the simplest and least traumatic when recurrent dislocation of the temporomandibular joint is treated surgically."

Illustrative activities are described and explanations of current trends are posited. Current programming trends in primary prevention reflect the \"state of the art\" today and the findings in this paper have implications for the future promotion of primary prevention activity."

The addition of 100 nmoles 1,25-(OH)2-D3 to the medium inhibited significantly the release of immunoreactive parathyroid hormone by 63--65%. This suppression was reversible when 1,25-(OH)2-D3 was removed again. The inhibition of parathyroid hormone release observed in human parathyroid adenoma tissue was similar to that in normal porcine parathyroid glands. This indicates that adenoma tissue is sensitive to regulatory influences. As well as calcium, 1,25-(OH)2-D3 may act as another feedback inhibitor of parathyroid hormone secretion."

PGE1 and adenosine increased UBF to levels comparable to those induced by estradiol-17beta, whereas PGE2 and PGA1 achieved only 20 and 36 per cent of peak estradiol-induced levels, respectively. PGE1, PGE2, and adenosine all caused transient increases in IUP while PGA1 had no effect on myometrial activity. Bradykinin increased UBF to 60 per cent of peak estradiol-induced levels, with concomitant increases in IUP tonus. PGE2 and PGF2alpha decreased peak estrogen-induced UBF by 50 and 70 per cent, respectively, while inducing related increases in IUP. When compared with oxytocin, the effects of PGE2 at high flow appeared to be mediated only my myometrial activity, whereas PGF2alpha apparently caused vasoconstriction as well. These findings support the concept that PGE1 could play a role in mediating estrogen-induced uterine vasodilatation."

        "abstract": "In experiments carried out on the isolated spinal cord of the lamprey (Lampetra fluviatilis) post-synaptic responses produced in spinal motoneurons by stimulation of the descending tract and dorsal roots were investigated by means of the intracellular recording technique. It is found that, in addition to giant reticulospinal (M\u00fcller's) axons, many other descending fibres as well as dorsal root afferents establish synaptic linkage with both chemical and electrical mode of transmission as revealed by their sensitivity to calcium-deficient and magnesium-rich perfusing solutions. Complex electrotonic EPSPs could have a very fast time course characteristic for the elementary responses but could also produce slow depolarization of the post-synaptic membrane, thus suggesting an integrative function of electrical synapses."

        "abstract": "Several methods of estimating the heparin neutralizing capacity of protamine were investigated for their reliability and practicability. The results from two chemical methods were compared with those from two in vitro biological assays, one of which was the method of the British Pharmacopoeia (1973). An in vivo method using mice was used to assess the accuracy of the in vitro test methods. Three standard heparin preparations were tested against the W.H.O. 1st International Reference Preparation for Protamine. Two of the heparin preparations were of mucosal origin, one of which was the 3rd International Standard, and the third heparin preparation was of lung origin (the 2nd International Standard for Heparin). The mean neutralization values (all methods) of heparin by protamine for a House Reference Preparation and the 3rd and 2nd International Standards for Heparin were 95.8, 109.8 and 89.9 units per mg of Protamine, respectively. All methods read the House Reference Preparation to have a lower value than the 3rd International Standard, which had a higher value than the 2nd International Standard for Heparin. There was a constant relationship between the results of any one method and those of another. The chemical and in vitro biological methods gave results of comparable precision although the latter required a greater degree of technical skill and time to perform."

The disease is characterized by recurrences of subacutely occurring polyradiculoneuropathy and sequent nearly complete remission. Clinical examination discloses preferentially symmetrically and distally occurring motor paresis while sensibility in most cases is less affected. The peripheral nerves may be enlarged after a few relapses and frequently painful to pressure during the bout. Excessive increase in CSF proteins is found only during the bout. Motor nerve conduction velocity is considerably reduced. Histological pictures typically present an onion bulb formation of the Schwann cells with marked proliferation of connective tissue. There frequently younger individuals are involved; the relation female to male is 3:1. Differentiation has to be made concerning hereditary and symptomatic forms of hypertrophic polyneuropathy. Etiological factors of the disease are discussed."

        "abstract": "Whenever a medication is prescribed, the lowest effective dose should be selected when possible. This recommendation is particularly important when oral contraception is being considered. In the years since the pill became available, there has been a steady decline in the dosages used. Contemporary \"low-dose\" varieties are those containing less than 50 micrograms of estrogen. Although they provide equal reliability, low estrogen formulations contain only a fraction of the quantities used in the original varieties. Subjective side effects are reported far less frequently with lower dose pills, and metabolic effects are reduced. The only associated disadvantage is a tendency to more spotting and breakthrough bleeding in early cycles. No matter how low the dose, there will always be some women for whom this method is not suitable. Fortunately, the progestogen-only pill--a consideralby underused contraceptive measure--can often be highly acceptable."

        "abstract": "The PC12 clone is a noradrenergic cell line derived from a rat pheochromocytoma. In culture medium containing horse serum, PC12 cells undergo mitosis; when nerve growth factor (NGF) is included in the medium, the cells cease multiplication and extend neuritis. It is shown here: (a) that PC12 cells are not viable in serum-free medium. When serum is withdrawn, 90 percent of the cells die within 4-6 days and 99 percent by 2-3 wk. (b) If NGF is added at the time of serum withdrawal, the cells undergo one doubling and remain viable for at least 1 mo. (c) Addition of NGF to cultures after more than 2 days in serum-free conditions results in maintenance of surviving cells, but not in an increase in cell number. (d) NGD also induces neurite outgrowth from PC12 cells in serum-free medium. (e) NGF-treated cells exhibit much less cell-cell and neurite-neurite aggregation in the absence than in the presence of serum. (f) The apparent minimum level of 2.5S NGF required for PC12 survival and morphological differentiation in serum-free medium is about 10 ng/ml (approximately 0.4 nM). (g) Withdrawal of NGF in serum-free conditions results in degeneration of neurites and loss of cell viability. (h) Experiments with campotothecin demonstrate that the effects of NGF on survival and neurite outgrowth may be uncoupled and suggest that the survival effects are transcriptionally independent. The present results also suggest that PC12 cells have a requirement for NGF (similar to that of normal sympathetic neurons) and that serum may substitute for this requirement. In addition, the present system of maintaining a highly differentiated cell line in a chemically defined medium suggests certain experimental opportunities."

Distances of this order may not correspond to the averaged electron micrographic data. The events leading to close approach of parts of cells are discussed in terms of electrical parameters, with an emphasis on the surface heterogeneities of cellular adherends. The distinct phenomenon of cell detachment is not simply the reverse of cell adhesion, and must be measured by different techniques. The effects of various pathophysiologic factors on cell attachment and detachment is discussed, with illustrative examples of direct and indirect factors. These include regeneration, degeneration, metabolic inhibitors, endotoxin and antisera. It is concluded the stability of the union between cells and teeth represents a delicate balance between factors promoting contact and initial adhesions, factors strengthening the adhesive interphase and factors promoting separation."

None of the patients with osteoarthrosis reacted positively. An antiserum was prepared to the material in synovial fluid reacting with the streptococcal extract. This antiserum reacted positively with all synovial fluids tested including the osteoarthrosis patients. It also reacted with all plasma samples tested but only with a few (18.2%) of serum samples. Immunodiffusion and absorption experiments demonstrated that the material reacting with the streptococcal extract was fibrinogen. Of 12 other streptococci examined only one, a Group C organism, gave a similar positive reaction with synovial fluids."

        "abstract": "The GLC/TEA method for N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) in beer was studied collaboratively by 13 laboratories from 7 countries. Collaborators were asked to analyze a total of 10 randomly labeled samples of beer consisting of the following duplicates: a naturally contaminated commercial beer; a beer extremely low (ca 0.1 ppb) in NDMA; and the low NDMA beer spiked with 0.5, 1.9, and 5.0 ppb NDMA. The pooled repeatability and reproducibility coefficients of variation (CV) for all samples were 17% and 27%, respectively. However, when data from 2 laboratories (outliers) were omitted, the corresponding CV values improved considerably (11% and 15%, respectively). Variance analysis showed the presence of a significant laboratory-sample interaction when all data were used for analysis, but this interaction disappeared when data from the 2 outlying laboratories were excluded. The pooled percent recovery of the overall method (omitting outliers) was 101.4 +/- 3.5. All the laboratories detected NDMA in the low NDMA beer. The method was adopted official first action."

Patients were divided into those with chemical diabetes (CD) (with incidentally discovered elevated glucose levels when stressed), overt diabetes (OD) (who required insulin support), and euglycemic nondiabetics (ND). Specimens from the quadriceps femoris and left anterior apical segment of the heart were examined ultrastructurally, with particular attention to the evaluation of capillary basal laminar thickness, using morphometric techniques. Results indicate (1) an increased, though statistically insignificant, thickening of capillary basal laminae in the quadriceps of CD and OD patients, in contrast with statistically significant laminar thickening in the diabetic myocardium; (2) early, mild laminar thickening in quadriceps and myocardium of the asymptomatic CD group; and (3) two characteristic patterns of basal laminar contours, homogeneous and lamellated, the latter being seen prominently in the quadriceps of diabetic patients in frequent association with pericapillary edema. These findings support the concept that basal laminar thickening in the diabetic is associated with deranged carbohydrate metabolism."

        "abstract": "The energy requirements for T-cell-mediated cytolysis have been investigated. Cytolytic thymus-derived lymphocytes (CTL) were generated in vitro in mixed leukocyte cultures and assayed for cytotoxicity on 51Cr-labeled mastocytoma target cells. Cytolysis was only slightly reduced in the absence of exogenous glucose (less than 5 micrometer) or under conditions of extreme hypoxia (less than 0.2 micrometer oxygen). Furthermore, neither the glucose analogues 2-deoxy-D-glucose and 5-thio-D-glucose nor the respiratory antagonists sodium azide and 2,4-dinitrophenol were very effective inhibitors of cytolysis when used individually. However, these glucose analogues were highly effective in inhibiting cytolysis in the absence of oxygen, and the respiratory antagonists inhibited cytolysis to a much greater extent in the absence of glucose. In addition, synergistic effects were observed when the glycolytic and respiratory inhibitors were combined. Taken together, these results indicate that T-cell-mediated cytolysis is an energy-dependent process which can be supported by either oxidative or glycolytic energy pathways."

The examinations were performed at diagnosis prior to any therapy, after remission induction, after cranial irradiation and 6 times during the maintenance therapy. The decreased phagocytic activity of monocytes to three studied microorganisms was found during two-year-observation, while the impairment of granulocytes phagocytosis only to Escherichia coli and Candida albicans was observed. It was suggested that degree of phagocytosis defect may depend on the stage of ALL and that it differs in respect of microorganisms used."

        "abstract": "An evaluation of a total of 2,460 patients treated with exposure during the period 1962-1971, marked that the exposure method showed satisfactory results, but also that there are clear upper limits for the possibilities of this method. The approach of treatment was reconsidered and consequently very severely burned patients were excised acutely in the years 1972-1975. It was proved plausible, permissable and practically possible. On May 1, 1976, a randomized, controlled clinical trial commenced: Patients admitted for fresh burns were divided into groups: one group was unsuited for trail (U), (e.g. small children, electric burns etc.); of the remaining patients every even was treated with acute excision (A), (i.e. operation within 24 hours post burn), every odd patient according to the classical exposure method (E), employed by our unit: exposure followed by excision and transplantation of all unhealed burned areas no later than day 14 post burn. The results concerning mortality in the first 2-year material are presented. In the first year, which began a few months after moving from a 115 year old hospital into a quite new university hospital, the mortality is found to be twice as high as that found the second year. The reasons are the difficulties caused as a result of moving to new larger buildings, needing an increase of staff with two thirds, all of which are inexperienced in the care of burned patients. The mortality is exactly the same in the group treated with acute excision (A) as the group treated with exposure (E). The trial must continue and results of studies concerning morbidity will be published later."

        "abstract": "The levels of tumour-specific antigen, antibody and specific immune complexes in the sera of rats bearing lung nodules of a chemically induced rat hepatoma, produced by intravenous inoculation of viable tumour cells, have been examined and compared with the levels of serum factors in animals actively immunized by intravenous inoculation of mixed tumour cells and BCG. Animals inoculated with cells alone developed multiple lung nodules which slowly grew, until on day 24 the remaining animals had to be killed due to respiratory distress. In contrast, the animals receiving a mixed inoculum of BCG and tumour cells developed no visible lung nodules and were capable of rejecting a further challenge of tumour cells. Tumour-specific antigen could be detected in the sera of both groups of rats at different times. In actively immunized animals free antigen could be detected from day 3 to day 10 after inoculation of cells BCG whereas in animals receiving cells alone, free antigen could not be detected until day 14 and persisted until the termination of the experiment. Free tumour-specific antibody, however, was found in the sera of rats actively immunized with tumour cells and BCG from day 10 onwards, although in the other group of animals it could not be detected. Conversely, immune complexes of tumour-specific antigen and antibody could be detected from day 10 in rats receiving cells alone and only at day 10 in actively immunized rats. The relevance of these findings in relation to what is known about serum factor levels during tumour growth and regression is discussed."

Human immunoglobulin light chain was freely filtered and largely reabsorbed. Fractional reabsorption was characteristic for each of four light chains and varied between 56% and 86%. No renal tubular maximum for human light chain was obtained. 3. Light chains at concentrations up to 10 times those seen in human myeloma were without effect on glomerular filtration rate or sodium and potassium reabsorption in experiments lasting up to 2 h. 4. Filtered and reabsorbed light chain returned ultimately to the perfusion medium, indicating a unique property of the tubular handling of this protein. None of the inhibitors tested (ouabain, frusemide, acetazolamide, probenicid) influenced light chain reabsorption. 5. The results are taken to indicate that light chain reaches the site of the transport enzyme, Na+,K+-dependent ATPase, at concentrations which vary with the nature of the light chain. This may provide a mechanism for renal damage in patients with myeloma, after prolonged exposure."

        "abstract": "The kinetics of the reaction of OH radicals with ferricytochrome c was studied in the time range 1 microsecond to 1 s by means of pulse radiolysis. The OH radicals reduce ferricytochrome c by 40% +/- 10%. The time course of the reduction is explained by a mechanism whereby a radical formed after hydrogen has been abstracted from the outer surface of the protein reduces the iron by electron tunnelling. We have calculated that the reducing electron in the radical is bound with an energy of at least 1.75 eV and that the frequency factor of the tunnelling process is v=10(11.5)s-1. This model accounts for the observed absorbance change in time range 5 . 10(-6)--10(-1)s. The time course of the reduction of ferricytochrome c by H radicals (Lichtin, N.N., Shafferman A. and Stein, G. (1974) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 357, 386--398) is explained by the same model."

        "abstract": "On the 10th-13th days of pregnancy toluene (3600 mg/m3) by inhalation) and on 12th day acetylsalicylic acid (500 mg/kg of body weight per os) were administered to CFY rats and the common effect of these agents was studied. It was established that: 1. the maternal toxicity increased, i.e. increased the mortality rate, decreased the consumption of the food and the gain of weight, increased the relative weight of the liver; 2. the foetal toxicity increased, i.e. increased the mortality rate of foetuses, the rate of the loss of the body weight, the number of the anomalies of the sternum and the incidence of the supernumerary ribs. It is believed, that the non-teratogenic toluene rises the utilization of the glycine and the level of the free salicylic-acid, consequently the embryotoxic effect of the acetylsalicylic-acid. The danger of the occurrence of malformations as an effect of interaction of chemical agents and drugs taken in therapeutic doses is stressed."

Data on the existence of this causative agent as a saprophyte in the soil of various continents are also given. A conclusion was drawn that A. boydii was an unpretencious geophilic fungus readily adaptible to the environmental conditions, much more widespread in nature than believed formerly."

After 18 to 20 hours there were 42.0 +/- 5.3 (x 10(6))/cm2 viable cells characterized by a high content of mature neutrophils (98.6 +/- 0.6%). Normal reactivity of migrated neutrophils was observed using the nitroblue tetrazolium reduction test. The chamber variant of the \"skin window\" method is recommended as a simple physiological technique for preparing pure populations of human neutrophils."

        "abstract": "In three groups--patients with recurrent calcium urolithiasis (RCU), patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT), and healthy controls--citrate was measured enzymatically in 24 and in 2-hr urine after an overnight fast. Citrate excretion per 24 hr was significantly lower in RCU than in age and sex matched controls, whereas there was no significant difference in citrate excretion in urines from the 2-hr morning collection. In pHPT citrate was also lower than in controls and fell within the range of RCU of comparable age. Both categories of urines (24 and 2hr) have in common the characteristic that the actual citrate concentration is lower by 50 per cent in RCU and pHPT than in controls, mainly as a result of the higher urine volume. Correction of citrate for creatinine does not disclose further differences among the populations studied but conversely hampers exact interpretation of urinary citrate in the absence of strict separation of individuals according to sex and age. From these data we conclude that (i) a low excretion and concentration of urinary citrate is detectable in calcium lithiasis and may contribute to a deficiency in inhibitory activity against nucleating processes in stone-forming urine; and (ii) the differences in urinary citrate elicited in samples of 24 and 2-hr morning urine are of unknown origin and merit further investigations."

The population was derived from a large, county school corporation in north central Indiana. A large proportion of each population at each grade supported at least some instructional emphasis about the topic, with nearly a majority or more of the subjects of most of the 16 populations favoring major teaching emphasis. Some differences in endorsement among the populations and sub-populations (male vs. female students) at each grade and among the four grades were found."

A proper biopsy technique and several practical aspects of technique of radiation therapy in management of osteosarcomas of bone are important factors in survival time of individual patients."

This was based on the concept that during rejection after kidney transplantation graft cells were recognized only because of sharing of alloantigens with lymphoid cells. There is, however, sufficient evidence to suggest that tissue specific recognition of proximal tubular cells and graft endothelial cells can occur by allospecific T cells and IgG antibodies, respectively. The antigens involved have not yet been well characterized, but seem to be of relevance in the pathogenesis of both interstitial and vascular rejection. Identification of the antigens involved may lead to more appropriate matching strategies."

        "abstract": "Chiasmal syndromes (characterized by bitemporal field defects, decrease of vision and simple optic atrophy) are not only caused by tumors within the chiasmal region, but also occur in inflammatory, toxic, demyelinizing and hereditary-atrophic processes of the chiasm, respectively the optic nerve. In the presence of classic bitemporal visual field defects the probability of a tumor within the sellar region is very great. Apart from the most frequent pituitary adenoma one has to consider the craniopharyngioma, the meningioma of the tuberculum sellae, the olfactory meningioma and the meningioma of the sphenoid wing. The specific symptomatology of these sellar, supra- or parasellar tumors is discussed. In the presence of atypical or incipient bitemporal visual field defects, as they occur also in the early stages of tumors of the chiasmal region, one has first of all to exclude all other possible causes for such field defects such as refraction scotomas, tobacco-alcohol-amblyopias, dominant hereditary optic atrophies, the uni- or bilateral optic neuritis and the intoxications of the optic nerves. In the differential diagnosis of tumors of the sellar region one has to consider infra- and supraclinoidal aneurysms, tumors of the chiasm (gliomas of the chiasm), the distant effect of a hydrocephalus of the IIIrd ventricle on the chiasm and the optochiasmatic arachnoiditis."

        "abstract": "Late hospital phase ventricular arrhythmias in acute myocardial infarction (MI) have been associated with a high incidence of sudden death following hospital discharge. Thirty-eight patients were studied 10-24 days following onset of symptoms of MI. Each patient had a 24-hour ambulatory ECG tape recording and left ventricular and coronary angiography performed. Patients with complicated ventricular arrhythmias (multiform, coupled, R on T VPCs or ventricular tachycardia), when compared to those with uncomplicated ventricular arrhythmias (unifocal or no VPCs), had a greater number of proximally narrowed major coronary arteries (P less than 0.001), a higher coronary \"score\" (P less than 0.001), a greater incidence of previous myocardial infarction (P less than 0.005), a greater percentage of abnormal left ventricular segments 86% vs 69% (P less than 0.001) and lower ejection fractions. These data suggest that late hospital phase survivors of MI with complicated ventricular arrhythmias have more extensive coronary artery disease with greater left ventricular dysfunction than survivors with uncomplicated ventricular arrhythmias. This more extensive disease may result in increased areas of ischemic myocardium and may help explain the refractoriness of these arrhythmias to pharmacologic therapy."

        "abstract": "Recombinant tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is expressed in Escherichia coli as a soluble intracellular protein. A purification process is described that incorporates a hydrophilic membrane (cellulosic) separation followed by a hydrophobic one (PTFE). The hydrophilic step is a traditional one in that species are separated primarily on the basis of size. The hydrophobic step separates species on the basis of parameters apparently not related to size. By combining these two steps, an increase in TNF purity of 7-10-fold can be achieved with a yield of 50%. The effects of cellular debris and pH on selectivity and recovery of the hydrophobic filtration step are discussed."

In the MES test, THC was the least potent and DPH the most potent blocker of hind limb tonic extensor convulsions whereas THC was the most potent and DPH the least potent in increasing the latency to this response and in preventing mortality. Seizures and mortality induced by pentylenetetrazol or by strychnine were enhanced by THC and DPH and were blocked by PB and CDP. In the test with nicotine, none of the four anticonvulsant agents prevented seizures; DPH was the only one which failed to increase latency; THC and DPH were less potent than PB and CDP in preventing mortality. THC most closely resembled DPH in the tests with chemical convulsant agents, but a sedative action of THC, resembling that of PB and CDP, was indicated by low ED5 0 for increased latency and for prevention of mortality in the MES test."

Serum somatomedin activity, determined by the porcine cartilage disk assay, was also increased by homocysteic acid. These findings relate an area of sulfur amino acid metabolism to the physiological action of growth hormone, accelerated growth in homocystinuria, initiation of arteriosclerosis, and control of cellular growth."

        "abstract": "Information gathered in the \"Zutphen study\", the Dutch contribution to the Seven Countries Study was used for the present study. Follow up data from 1965 to 1 July 1985 were used. During this follow up, the morbidity state of the participants was verified at regular intervals. In 1965 lung function was measured by spirometry and the vital capacity (VC) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) were available. A complete set of data was available for 668 men. The occurrence of chronic non-specific lung disease (CNSLD) at a specific time was coded by one physician, using strict criteria. Information about the cause of death was obtained and coded by one physician in 1985. Occupation was coded and a distinction between blue and white collar workers was made. For the analysis of the relation between age, lung function, smoking habits, and occupational state with CNSLD incidence and mortality, proportional hazard models were used. Blue collar workers had a significantly raised risk for incidence of CNSLD only. The hazard ratio for blue v white collar workers with CNSLD mortality was 1.4 but not statistically significant. It was concluded that occupation is clearly related to incidence of CNSLD. There were indications that occupation is related to mortality from CNSLD. A reduced FEV1 was a strong predictor of both CNSLD incidence and mortality. It is noteworthy that small differences in age and height standardised lung function were significantly related to incidence of CNSLD, mortality from CNSLD, and total mortality. Although these differences in lung function have no direct clinical importance for the individual subject, they indicate a raised morbidity and mortality risk for the population."

We used Medicare Part A claims and enrollment records of a 5% nationally random sample of elderly Medicare beneficiaries from 1983 to 1985 to estimate how patient age and sex affected perioperative mortality and 1- and 2-year survival rates among elderly patients undergoing a colon resection procedure for colon cancer. Among the 5,586 individuals in our data set, the overall perioperative mortality rate was 5.0%, ranging from 3.3% in beneficiaries 66 to 69 years of age to 9.3% in those 85 years of age and older. Men had a 31% higher perioperative mortality rate than women (5.8% versus 4.4%, p less than 0.05). The overall postoperative survival rates at 1 and 2 years were 72% and 63%, respectively, decreasing with increasing age, but were similar in men and women. This analysis provides age- and sex-specific estimates of outcomes following surgery for elderly patients with colon cancer that are more precise and have more potential for generalization than those that were available previously."

        "abstract": "Infection of the peritoneum has an adverse effect on the healing of colonic anastomoses. It has been suggested that infection results in a disturbance of colonic collagen metabolism, but the precise nature of the biochemical disorder is uncertain. Colonic collagen metabolism was studied in infected anastomoses in the left colon of rats. The rats were labeled with radioactive proline from an early stage of growth, and infected anastomoses were compared with anastomoses of the control group of uninfected rats. Infection resulted in significant changes in collagen metabolism during the early phase of colonic healing. There was a significant reduction in the amount of salt soluble collagen in infected anastomoses on the third postoperative day compared with anastomoses of the control group, and reduced amounts of acid soluble collagen and insoluble collagen were found in infected anastomoses on the seventh postoperative day. These observations suggest that the defective healing of infected colonic anastomoses results either from an increased lysis of newly formed--salt soluble--collagen or from a reduction in the intracellular formation of collagen."

        "abstract": "It was shown on human corpses that the glenohumeral joint may be compared to a piston surrounded by a valve. The glenoid labrum, then, should work like the valve block, sealing the joint from atmospheric pressure. In order to test this hypothesis, 18 human shoulder preparations were studied. The mean stabilizing force obtained by atmospheric pressure was 146 N. Additionally, 15 patients without any sign of instability and 17 patients with an anterior instability of the shoulder were tested under general anesthesia. In stable shoulder joints, traction at the arm caused negative intra-articular pressure that could be correlated to the amount of force exerted. In contrast, unstable shoulder joints with a tear of the glenoid labrum (Bankart lesion) did not exhibit this phenomenon. For unstable shoulder joints, the piston-and-valve model is no longer valid. This enlarges the current concept of shoulder joint stability in two ways: (a) the absence of negative intra-articular pressure disturbs joint mechanics and (b) altered pressure receptors might disturb motor coordination that dynamically protects the shoulder from dislocating forces."

        "abstract": "FL, HeLa and other non-murine epithelial cells are capable of inducing chondroosseous differentiation when brought into contact with mouse thigh mesenchymal cells. Immunosuppression as produced by cortisone or mouse antilymphocyte serum is required to prevent rejection and to allow growth of the foreign epithelial cells. Cartilage appears within 7 days and bone within 9 days following epithelial cell injection. Electron microscopic studies indicate that the induced cartilage and bone is normal in basic strucutre, and that calcification is mediated by extracellular matrix vesicles. Various forms of mechanical and chemical injury have consistently failed to stimulate cartilage or bone formation in the mouse thigh. Explantation of preosseous thigh tumors to mouse brain allows continued growth of human and mouse cells with development of cartilage or bone in 67 per cent of implants. Microscopy indicates cartilage and bone formation by many mesenchymal cells which are not in direct contact with epithelium. To account for this, two mechanisms of bone induction are envisioned: (1) short-range diffusion of inductive substance(s) and/or (2) transfer of the inductive stimulus by direct surface contact from epithelial cell to mesenchymal cell to mesenchymal cell and so on."

The changes in the number of synaptic ribbons and ribbon fields was observed by electron microscopy. The number of these intracellular elements was greatest at 2:00 and lowest at 14:00, the difference being statistically significant. There were no significant local differences in numbers with respect to the part of the pineal gland examined. The data are similar to those of Vollrath from the pineal gland of a guinea pig, and seem to confirm a circadian function in the pineal gland in mammals."

        "abstract": "The concept that relates low virulence of certain alphaviruses to low viremia and efficient vascular clearance of virus was tested in guinea pigs. Previously published studies with hamsters suggested that virulent strains maintain high viremias primarily because they are cleared inefficiently from the blood. In the present study, with guinea pigs, six of six virulent strains of Venezuelan encephalitis virus were cleared inefficiently, whereas three of six nonlethal or benign virus strains were cleared rapidly. However, three other guinea pig-benign Venezuelan encephalitis virus strains cleared slowly, to produce a high viremia was correlated with inefficient growth in primary viral replication sites. Thus, the potential of some alphaviruses to produce destructive lesions may be restricted by efficient clearance of virus from the blood, whereas the growth of other benign alphavirus strains may be restricted after the virus is presented to target cells."

        "abstract": "The 44-amino-acid E5 oncoprotein of bovine papillomavirus type 1 transforms immortalized murine fibroblast cell lines. This highly hydrophobic protein forms homodimers, localizes to intracellular membrane compartments (including the Golgi apparatus), and forms a complex with the 16-kDa membrane-embedded constituent (16k) of the vacuolar proton-ATPase. To develop a system for the genetic and biochemical analysis of the E5/16k interaction, the E5 gene was cloned into a new vector which was designed for expression in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The E5 protein synthesized in this system dimerized normally and bound to endogenous and overexpressed S. pombe 16k protein. Comparison of the S. pombe and mammalian 16k proteins showed strong conservation in carboxyl-terminal amino acids but greater variation in the amino-terminal sequences, suggesting that E5 was interacting with the 16k carboxyl domains. Finally, a new protein epitope tag is described which permitted for the first time the coprecipitation of E5 with antibodies directed against the 16k protein."

This appears to be a separate genetic disorder(s) from that described as Machado-Joseph disease. In five subjects, other relatives had similar multisystem involvement. None was of known Portuguese ancestry. The extrapyramidal syndrome was mainly parkinsonian. Pain was prominent in five subjects. In all cases, low or moderate doses of levodopa/carbidopa ameliorated both the pain and the parkinsonian features. In one patient, a randomized placebo-controlled trial of levodopa/carbidopa was found to significantly improve most symptoms and neurologic dysfunction scores related to the extrapyramidal syndrome."

        "abstract": "The vasoactive regulatory peptides produced by neural and endothelial tissues contribute to normal vascular function and can modify the inflammatory process. Modern microscopic imaging techniques are revealing the plasticity of this neurovascular peptidergic system, highlighting changes in the synthesis, release, binding and degradation of vasoactive peptides during the inflammatory process. Initial changes may represent normal protective mechanisms against tissue injury, while subsequently a loss of neurovascular regulation may contribute to the pathogenesis of some inflammatory conditions. Understanding the complexity of these regulatory systems provides novel insights into the inflammatory process and suggests new possibilities for therapeutic approaches to human disease. In this review we examine the potential for modern microscopic imaging techniques to help elucidate the complexity of the inflammatory process, as illustrated by the involvement of the vasoactive neural- and endothelial-derived regulatory peptides substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptide, neuropeptide Y and endothelin."

Although the aetiology of the attacks was unknown, all the infants had a family history of similar convulsions occurring at the same age and having a benign outcome. The attacks, which always occurred in a cluster, were promptly controlled, in four cases with phenobarbital and in one case with valproate. Seizures were partial with secondary generalization and were characterized by head and eye deviation (not always the same side in each attack) diffuse hypertonia and then bilateral limb jerks. The interictal EEG was normal. The ictal EEG showed diffuse discharge with onset in the central-occipital region. Laboratory, radiological and neurological findings were normal. A history in at least one paternal relative (the father in four cases) of similar seizures, occurring at the same age suggested a genetic predisposition. No seizures or EEG anomalies were observed during the follow up."

It is recommended that all patients with malignant mesothelioma of the peritoneum be treated by total abdominal irradiation and intreperitoneal instillation of colloid P32."

Prostaglandins, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, and phorbol esters were tested for their ability to inhibit radiation-induced decreases in calcium influx. None of the compounds tested alone completely prevented radiation-induced decreases in calcium uptake, but some drug combinations did inhibit decreases. Results suggest that radiation-induced decreases in calcium uptake are due to impairment of protein kinase C activity and mobilization of calcium by these drugs."

        "abstract": "The calibrated side to side portocaval shunt was described in 1979 by P. Marion. This type of shunt preserves a hepatopedal blood flow by maintaining portocaval pressure gradient superior to halve of the initial gradient. Twenty nine shunts were performed from 1981 to 1989 in patients with hemorrhagic liver cirrhosis alcoholic in 83 percent of cases). Two patients were in Child Pugh C class (7%), six procedures were performed as an emergency (21%). The operative mortality was nil. The hepatopedal blood flow assessed by direct venous angiography was maintained in 66% of cases at one year and 22% at five years. The actuarial survival rate without recurrent bleeding was 96% at two years, 88% at five years. Severe chronic encephalopathy was noted in three cases (10.3%). One patient was successfully treated by surgical anastomotic tightening with disappearance of the hepatic encephalopathy. The actuarial survival rate without encephalopathy was 82.7% at five years. The side to side calibrated shunt is a technically easy procedure with low mortality, low incidence of thrombosis and clinical results similar to the results of Warren's procedure. For these reasons, we have decided to include this procedure in our local protocol of management of hemorrhagic liver cirrhosis."

The redox site, an 4Fe:4S cluster, is structurally separated from the MgATP binding site. For MgATP hydrolysis to be coupled to electron transfer, a signal transduction mechanism is proposed that is similar to that in guanosine triphosphatase proteins. Based on the three-dimensional structure of Fe-protein, Asp125 is likely to be part of a putative transduction path. Altered Fe-protein with Glu replacing Asp has been prepared and retains the ability for the initial nucleotide-dependent conformational change. However, either MgADP or MgATP can induce the shift and Mg binding to the nucleotide is no longer essential."

        "abstract": "A new method is described to noninvasively and continuously measure changes in blood volume (BV) during hemodialysis by means of an optical reflection method with an optical monitor (950 nm) clipped onto the arterial blood line. The amount of reflected light (L) appeared to be linearly proportional to the erythrocyte concentration (r = 0.91). Changes in L correlated well with changes in erythrocyte concentration during hemodialysis (r = 0.94). A study in 10 patients on regular dialysis was done. The BV decrease after 3 hr of treatment was 17.0 +/- 5.2%, and it correlated with the amount of fluid withdrawn by ultrafiltration (mean, 2,519 +/- 589 ml). Five hypotensive episodes were seen that were characterized by a higher rate of BV fall during the preceding 15 min (9.9 +/- 1.9 versus 3.6 +/- 4.3%/hrp; p < 0.05) and by a lower BV value at that moment (78.2 +/- 3.4 versus 84.5 +/- 4.5%; p < 0.025) than in the other five patients at comparable times. It was concluded that this optical method was a means to detect hypovolemia at an early stage and to prevent ultrafiltration induced hypotension."

Other organ system anomalies may be associated with neural tube defects: for instance, various types of thymus pathology have been reported in these patients. In this study thymic changes were investigated in 30 stillborns with neural tube defects seen between January 1988 and June 1989. Thymic weights were significantly reduced in 14 cases and increased in 7. One patient had a double thymus, and in two cases no thymus tissue could be found. These findings suggest a primary developmental defect of the neural crest, affecting the orderly development of the thymus gland."

        "abstract": "When mice were irradiated immediately before infection with Trichinella spiralis there was a profound and long-lasting interference with their ability to expel adult worms from the intestine. Irradiation given after the fifth day of infection was progressively less effective in this respect. The ability to expel worms was not restored when mesenteric lymph node cells (MLNC) were transferred (a) on the day of infection in mice irradiated one day previously, or (b) on day 7 of an infection in mice irradiated on day 6, even though the MLNC transferred immunity to intact recipients. Transfer of bone marrow (BM) alone was also without effect. However, worm expulsion was restored if, following irradiation and injection of BM, 10 days were allowed for BM differentiation before transfer of MLNC. This restoration was effective even after lethal levels of irradiation and was clearly dependent upon a donor-derived BM component cooperating with, or responding to, the activity of the transferred MLNC. The possibility that the BM component is non-lymphoid in nature is discussed."

        "abstract": "It is generally assumed, that a disturbance of microcirculation is the common pathogenetic end factor in various cochleovestibular disorders of different etiology. Therefore improvement of microcirculation is an important therapeutic goal. Several studies demonstrated, that hydroxyethylstarch (HES) has better haemorheological effects than Dextran and less side effects. For this reason we have changed the therapy with Dextran since 1987 to hydroxyethylstarch in several oto-neurological disorders (as sudden hearing loss, neuronopathia vestibularis, idiopathic facial palsy). As after the therapy with HES--generally after dismissal from the ENT-department--some patients complained of general pruritus, so we performed a retrospective study with a standardized interview-protocol. Of 481 treated patients we investigated 237 (49%): of 149 patients treated with HES 200/0.5, 43 patients (28.8%) complained of pruritus; from 88 patients treated with Dextran 40, only 5 patients (5.7%) reported pruritus. The difference is significant (p less than 0.0001). In nearly half of the patients (more than 40%) the pruritus started in normal skin 1 to 3 weeks after the HES-therapy and lasted for 6 weeks to 6 months; the itching was very resistant to therapy (f.e. with antihistaminics). We want to draw the attention to this possible, in the literature until now quite neglected, for some patients extremely uncomfortable and socially embarrassing side effects after HES-therapy when given in relatively high doses. It is therefore suggested therapeutic recommendations should be developed to prevent this undesired side effect."

        "abstract": "In summary one can record that the biochemist has discovered a beautiful metabolic pathway for vitamin D which is probably as yet incomplete. Subsequently the medicinal chemist has provided numerous synthetic analogues. However, delays in the diagnosis and treatment of vitamin D disorders, due to lack of specific assays and inadequate supplies of therapeutic metabolites, still unfortunately exist. It is hoped that these problems will be rectified as soon as more plentiful supplies of the appropriate metabolites are available."

        "abstract": "A program was designed to teach coin equivalence to mentally retarded adolescents. Coin equivalence was defined as choosing several different combinations of coins to equal specified target values. A pretest-posttest matched-groups design was employed with an experimental group receiving the monetary training, and a no-training control group. A multiple baseline across coin-counting responses was also incorporated in the experimental group. Training was divided into six stages, each teaching one specific method of combining coins to equal 10 target values from 5 cents through 50 cents. A three-component response chain was used, requiring (a) naming, (b) selecting and counting, and (c) depositing target monetary values into a coin machine. Experimental subjects improved significantly in coin equivalence performance and maintained their skill on follow up tests; control subjects did not."

We have treated 25 patients with this pathology, 10 with obstructive tumor, which impeded the insertion of the endoscope, and 15 non-obstructive tumors. Higher technical difficulties on the former, together with a worse clinical situation, due to the fact that the tumor was more invasive, produce a more discrete result and with a higher risk of complications (one patient had a perforation and other an obstructive stenosis after two months of treatment) in comparison with the group of patients with non-obstructive tumors. However the treatment improved their quality of life with the recovery of their intestinal function. Among patients with non-obstructive tumors of the colonic light, prolonged survival (mean 6.8 months) was reached by 73.3% of patients belonging to this group; disappearing after treatment even the endoscopic view of the tumor in 33.3% of the patients."

        "abstract": "Two hypotonic but non-haemolysing irrigating solutions, sorbitol-mannitol (2% + 1%) and glycine (1.5%), were compared in 40 TURP cases using a continuous resection technique. Ethanol (1%) was added to the irrigating fluid as a marker to make possible early detection of fluid absorption by breath analysis. Mannitol and sorbitol were determined in plasma and urine; glycine and ethanol were determined in plasma. Apparent absorbed fluid volumes were calculated from the immediate postoperative plasma concentrations of ethanol, mannitol, sorbitol and glycine and from the elimination of mannitol in urine during 24 hours following the operation. The use of a continuous operating technique with a suprapubic trocar resulted in very small absorptions (less than 1 l) in this series. The concentrations of the two solutes in the sorbitol-mannitol irrigating fluid were balanced so that the plasma concentrations immediately postoperatively were of the same order when absorption occurred. The sorbitol concentration declined more rapidly than the mannitol concentration in conformity with previous findings. In most cases the peak plasma level was observed immediately postoperatively but in some cases at a later time (during the interval 0-2 hours), indicating absorption from a depot of fluid accumulated extravesically in addition to direct intravenous absorption. The best estimate of fluid absorption seems to be obtained from the urinary elimination of mannitol, followed by estimates based on the plasma mannitol concentration immediately postoperatively. The plasma ethanol level determined at the same time gave an estimate of the same order, whereas plasma sorbitol and glycine levels gave lower estimates (owing to rapid redistribution and metabolism).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

        "abstract": "The partitioning of a variety of extracellular lipases, both pro- and eucaryotic, in detergent-based aqueous two-phase systems was examined. The results revealed that all procaryotic lipases showed a clear preference for the detergent-rich coacervate phase. In contrast, all eucaryotic lipases were significantly excluded from this phase, most probably caused by their glycosylation. The potential of such detergent-based systems for the isolation of extracellular lipases directly from cell-free culture broth was analyzed using the bacterium Pseudomonas cepacia (DSM 50181). This strain was identified after a limited screening for lipase activity. About 76% of the lipase could be extracted into the coacervate phase in just one purification step, leading to a four-fold concentration of lipase and a purification factor of 24."

When administered orally in dosages of 1 to 30 mg/kg, 30 minutes before stimulation, ISDN prolonged the time to arterial occlusion by a factor of 2 to 3 times. This effect was significant from doses of 1 mg/kg. This anti-thrombotic activity was unchanged by pretreatment of 100 mg/kg I.V. of acetylsalicylic acid, a dose sufficient to inhibit prostacycline synthesis. On the other hand, its activity was completely blocked by the administration of an inhibitor of NO-synthetase, L-nitroarginine methylester (1 mg/kg I.V.). These results show that ISDN is active on a model of arterial thrombosis in the rat by a mechanism independent of prostacycline production but implying a stimulation of the formation of nitric oxide."

The identification of an established syndrome in this patient permits one to view the combination of abnormalities present in a more coherent manner."

        "abstract": "A woman with Addison disease developed hyperpigmentation, headache, and nausea despite conventional replacement therapy with cortisone. Excessively elevated plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) with absence of response to administration of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), and roentgenological evidence of enlargement of the sella turcica, as well as detection of enlarged pituitary gland on magnetic resonance images, led to a diagnosis of ACTH-producing microadenoma, which was removed by transsphenoidal microsurgery. The specimen obtained at surgery evidenced corticotroph hyperplasia, as demonstrated by immunohistochemical staining for ACTH. Fine structure exhibited densely granulated cells with a few bundles of microfilaments and an abundance of large lysosomal bodies. Surgical removal of the hyperplasia alleviated the patient's symptoms, and hyperpigmentation faded remarkably. Her plasma ACTH level returned to normal, has remained normal for more than 3 years, and responds adequately to CRF administration."

        "abstract": "Cells of the corpora lutea of albino rats were examined histochemically after the administration of high perogesteron doses at various periods of pregnancy and lactation. Before the prepartum exogenous progesteron failed to influence the fetal development, during the prepartum--led to prolongation of the periods of pregnancy, and by the 25th day--to the intrauterine death of the fetuses in 100% of cases. Progesteron administration during the lactation increased the lactic acid function. Saturation of the organism with exogenous progesteron was accompanied by depression of the secretory activity of the lutein cells without any functional changes in the interstitial cells. Metabolic processes were disturbed in the lutein cells, this being expressed in the interruption of formation of the secretory vacuoles, reduction of the plate complex of Golgi function and a sharp depression of the lipid synthesis. Mitochondria are subject to disintegration. A comparative morphofunctional analysis of the corpus luteum cells under conditions of directed changed hormonal balance confirmed the concept on the separate production of progestins and estrogens by two types of the secretory cells."

These methods include dye inclusion and exclusion assays such as the classical trypan blue exclusion assay, the propidium iodide (PI) exclusion assay and the fluorescein diacetate (FDA) inclusion assay. Furthermore, the relation was studied between release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) by hybridoma cells and their viability. Also the ATP content of the cells and cellular heterogeneity as measured with a flow cytometer were determined in relation to cellular viability. The dye inclusion and exclusion assays using trypan blue, FDA, PI were shown to be useful methods to determine cellular viability. With the FDA and PI methods it was possible to obtain additional information about cells which are in a transition state between viable and non-viable. The viability according to the scatter properties of the cells appears to reflect the overall condition of the cells, although interpretation of the results is difficult. Measurement of LDH release in the culture fluid or the cytoplasmic ATP content could not be used as parameters for cell viability."

        "abstract": "The additive natriuretic effect of a single dose of bendroflumethiazide, 5 mg., has been studied in patients with advanced congestive heart failure in long-term treatment with bumetanide, 4 mg., daily. Three permutation trial tests were performed including six patients each. In the first trial, the response to supplementary bendroflumethiazide, 5 mg., was definitely superior to that of additional bumetanide, 4 mg., in terms of renal output of sodium, chloride, potassium, water, and osmolar clearance. In the second trial, a similar pattern was found in patients receiving a combination of bumetanide, 4 mg., and spironolactone, 100 mg., daily. The third trial compared the effects of bendroflumethiazide, 5 mg., plus bumetanide, 4 mg.; of bendroflumethiazide, 5 mg.; and of bumetanide, 4 mg. In terms of natriuresis and chloruresis, the response to the combination of two drugs was significantly larger than the sum of the effects of other treatments. It is concluded that the combined effects of the drugs represent a supra-additive effect addition for sodium and chloride. A tentative explanation of the mechanism of interaction in terms of inhibition of renal tubular supplementary spironolactone, involve a tendency to development of hypokalemia, hypochloremia, and alkalosis, it is recommended that supplementary use of bendroflumethiazide in this setting is combined with the administration of potassium chloride or potassium-saving diuretics."

        "abstract": "Patients with depressive motor retardation, neuroleptic induced parkinsonism or Parkinson's disease were tested on movement tasks requiring control of simultaneous movements. This was in order to determine whether these three groups of patients, who all show slowing of movements, also share the distinctive impairment of simultaneous movement control that is observed in Parkinson's disease. Though all three patient groups showed equivalent slowing on the motor tasks that were studied, the patterns of impairment were different. Only the patients with parkinsonism, either neuroleptic induced or from Parkinson's disease, showed additional slowing of a rapid ballistic elbow flexion movement when it was performed simultaneously with a rapid squeeze of the ipsilateral hand. Only patients with parkinsonism showed a significant increase in dual task interference on a bimanual bead and tapper task, compared with controls. The bead and tapper interference in patients with depressive motor retardation was between that of controls and parkinsonism. Having a bimanual skill had a large effect on the subjects' dual task interference on this task. The measures of dual task interference for the two tasks did not correlate with one another; difficulty running simultaneous motor programs does therefore not explain the interference that is observed when tapping is performed while the other hand simultaneously performs a dextrous motor task. Only patients with parkinsonism showed increased fatigue on the tapping task. The patients with depressive motor retardation did have elevated scores on a clinical rating of parkinsonism. Nevertheless there are clearly defined differences between the movement disorder observed in patients with depression, and that observed in in parkinsonism. The patterns of impairments in patients with neuroleptic parkinsonism were very similar to those of Parkinson's disease."

        "abstract": "The validity of the pedometer and actometer for estimating the daily physical activity was evaluated by means of an observation study. The physical activity in a classroom of 11 pupils of a kindergarten was assessed by means of a pedometer, actometer and by observation. Besides this an activity questionnaire was completed by the infant-quide. On basis of the individual observation it is clear that the infant-guide can give valuable information about the activity of the children at school. The results of the pedometer attached to the waist and the actometers attached to the ankle were significantly correlated with the results of the observation method. The wrist actometer showed a smaller but still significant correlation with the other variables. Implications of this findings are discussed in regard toward the physical activity. The pedometer results point out that when the percentage of intense activity is high the pedometer tends to underestimate the level of activity. The actometer results indicate that such a motion recorder gives a reliable estimation of activity in children. The findings are discussed in terms of the practical applications of the actometer in the research of daily physical activity and the physical rehabilitation treatment of certain diseases."

        "abstract": "The Snell-Bagg hypopituitary dwarf mouse has been shown to be deficient in growth hormone, thyroxine, and prolactin. There are reports indicating that in addition to these neuroendocrine abnormalities, development of immune competence is also severely impaired in these animals. However, other studies indicate that the immunologic potential of these mice does not differ from their heterozygous littermate controls. Our data show that dwarf mice weaned at 21 days of age and killed at that time, or 7 days later, have reduced numbers of cells in both the spleen and thymus and the mitogen responsiveness of these cells is impaired. However, if mice weaned on day 21 are analyzed at 32 days of age or the mice are weaned at day 30 and analyzed 7 days later the ability to respond to mitogenic stimulation does not differ from controls. Further experiments show that dwarf mice weaned at 30 days of age have a normal complement of V-beta TCR as evidenced by immunofluorescence analysis as well as a primary antibody response to SRBC equivalent to that observed in normal littermates. Immunofluorescence analysis of CD4 and CD8 expression on thymocytes obtained from dwarf mice shows a distinct pattern dependent on the time of weaning and time of analysis. Initial analysis of thymocytes from dwarf mice weaned and killed at 21 days of age do not differ from controls. However, cells from dwarf mice weaned on day 21 and killed on day 28 are markedly different with a loss of immature CD4+/CD8+ cells and a corresponding increase in CD4+ and CD8+ mature thymocytes. In contrast, the phenotype of thymocytes obtained from dwarf mice weaned at 30 days of age and killed on day 37 did not differ from normal littermates. Collectively these studies indicate that hypopituitary dwarf mice lag behind their heterozygous littermates with respect to development of immunocompetence but normal immune responsiveness does develop by 32 days of age when the mice are weaned on day 21."

        "abstract": "Lactoferrin is a 77-kDa iron-binding protein to which a wide variety of divergent biologic functions have been ascribed. It has recently been reported that lactoferrin interacts with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in such a fashion as to affect the binding of lactoferrin to myeloid cells. Two other potential interactions of LPS and lactoferrin were explored. Lactoferrin prevents hydroxyl radical formation by binding iron, even at low pH. Lactoferrin inhibited iron-catalyzed formation of hydroxyl radical in the presence of LPS at pH 7.4 and 4.5. Low concentrations of LPS can be used to \"prime\" neutrophils toward enhanced function, such as formation of stimulated superoxide anion. Lactoferrin inhibited LPS priming of neutrophils if LPS contamination of the protein (provided by commercial suppliers) was first reduced. Inhibition of LPS priming was observed whether apolactoferrin or iron-saturated lactoferrin was used. Similar inhibition of LPS priming was observed when neutrophils were incubated with other serum proteins (e.g., albumin, apotransferrin, or iron-saturated transferrin). These results show that LPS should not be expected to affect the free radical biology of lactoferrin, which is a crucial physiologic function of this protein. However, lactoferrin inhibits LPS priming, and this effect requires consideration in experimental models of inflammation."

These disturbances of impulse formation and conduction involve many diagnostic problems. If clinical methods as ECG monitoring are of no help, provocative tests are indicated. The best indirect test of the sinus node activity is the measurement of the sinus node recovery time after overdrive suppression. In addition, the sinu-atrial conduction time, the conduction velocity within the right atrium, the A-V node and the His-Purkinje system can be measured. In patients with the sick sinus syndrome abnormalities of conduction in the specialized cardiac tissue are common in addition to sinus node dysfunction. The results of the provocative tests are important for drug therapy or pacemaker implantation."

        "abstract": "In order to evaluate the phonatory results obtained with the use of tracheoesophageal prostheses, 38 laryngectomees were examined, 20 of which underwent erigmophonic voice rehabilitation while the other 18 were rehabilitated with the application of a prosthesis. In all cases electroglottography and spectrography of the voice were performed. In the erigmophonic-voice subjects, electroglottography gave a normal glottic wave while spectrography gave a tracing with frequent interruptions, scarce harmonics, altered by the presence of background noises. In the tracheoesophageal prosthesis patients, the electroglottogram showed regular hypopharynx vibratory activity while the spectrogram appeared free of interruptions activity while the spectrogram appeared free of interruptions and presented a uniform distributions and presented a uniform distribution of suffixes. The data obtained demonstrate that better results are obtained with the use of tracheoesophageal prosthesis as it allows the exhaled air to be used in phonation and thus respects respiratory dynamics and pneumophonic synergism. It also makes it possible to achieve a clear, fluent voice. Furthermore, the results obtained with patients with this prosthesis were constantly satisfactory when the long exercises required were performed."

In a concerning age uniform dosage/body weight isoprenalin and adrenalin increase the heart rate of the older organism on a larger scale than in the younger. The increased sensitiveness of the heart of old persons to beta-adrenergics is to be taken in consideration in therapeutic use with regard to cardiac side effects. In juvenile adults the systolic blood pressure is more increased by isoprenalin as well as the diastolic blood pressure by noradrenalin than in older persons. The concerning age different cardiovascular effects of the investigated adrenergics in man are discussed in connection with findings of animal experiments with regard to aging in the sensitiveness of adrenergic receptors."

        "abstract": "We investigated the pharmacokinetics of cyclosporin A (CsA) blood levels and drug toxicity in a chronic rat study in which long-term (30 weeks) CsA was administered. Ninety Lewis rats received subcutaneous CsA at 5 mg/kg/day for 12 weeks, at which time CsA injections were stopped in 50 animals. The remaining 40 rats were maintained on 5 mg/kg CsA daily until week 18 and then switched to an alternate day dosing until week 30. All rats were observed daily and weighed weekly. Whole blood CsA levels were determined by a commercially available radioimmunoassay kit. The daily dosing regimen resulted in greatly elevated trough CsA levels (greater than 1,600 micrograms/liter) and substantial chronic systemic toxicity, with weight loss and death in eight animals. Alternate day dosing reduced trough levels (mean 1,311 micrograms/liter) and decreased toxicity. Chronic administration by the subcutaneous route resulted in a considerable depot effect, with constancy of drug levels over a 48 hr dosing interval and a slow decline of drug levels (15 days) upon cessation of treatment. These results underscore the importance of monitoring both body weight and blood CsA levels in rodent studies when CsA is employed. Investigators should be aware of drug accumulation with chronic therapy and the consequent need to modify dosing to prevent toxicity."

Changes in memory can be secondary to alterations in other cognitive domains such as attention, or non-cognitive domains (mood and arousal), or the direct result of alterations on those neurobiological systems that determine memory functions. The selective memory impairing effects of benzodiazepines are used to illustrate how cognitive neuroscience methods and theory can be useful in assessing the memory changes produced by psychoactive drugs."

        "abstract": "Dialysis-induced hypotension, the sharp decrease in blood pressure occurring during hemodialysis, remains one of the most difficult problems associated with hemodialysis even today. However, there is yet no established theory to explain the mechanism triggering dialysis-induced hypotension. This review attempts to offer a consistent and cohesive source of information on the hemodynamics during dialysis-induced hypotension, and then analyzes etiologic factors in such hypotension reported by various investigators. Finally, three hypotheses concerning the mechanism of dialysis-induced hypotension including our own are introduced."

        "abstract": "We have examined the parameters that determine the length and distribution of products synthesized processively by the human immunodeficiency virus reverse transcriptase (HIV-RT). On native or homopolymer templates, the overall length distribution of processively synthesized products is increased by increased temperature or deoxynucleoside triphosphate concentration, or decreased ionic strength. Specific terminations of processive synthesis on either native DNA or RNA templates occur most frequently at positions where the reverse transcriptase (RT) pauses during synthesis. These sites correlate with the template sequence 3'-(A/U)(A/U)(G/C)-5', particularly when this sequence is predicted to be base paired with another region of the template in a secondary structure. Many positions of termination are in similar positions on DNA or RNA templates. Notable exceptions are runs of A residues, which promote termination on DNA but not RNA templates. Termination intensities vary when different RTs are used demonstrating an influence of RT structure."

        "abstract": "Twenty patients with dermatitis herpetiformis treated with di(4-aminophenyl)-sulphone (Dapsone) were analyzed with respect to serum hemopexin concentration as well as some other haematological parameters. With one exception, there were normal concentrations of serum hemopexin when the haptoglobin and methaemoglobin concentrations were normal. Ten out of 11 patients with haptoglobin below 0.3 g/l, which is the lower limit of reference interval at this laboratory, had their hemopexin concentrations reduced to various extents. There was an inverse relationship between the concentration of serum hemopexin and blood methaemoglobin. There was no correlation between amount of Heinz bodies and the concentrations of blood methaemoglobin, serum haptoglobin or serum hemopexin. It is concluded that serum hemopexin measurement should be of value in the assessment of the severity of the haemolysis caused by the drug treatment in those cases who have a low serum haptoglobin concentration."

        "abstract": "Three toxic polypeptides were purified from the venom of the Brazilian scorpion Tityus serrulatus by means of gel filtration in Sephadex G-50 and ion-exchange chromatography in carboxymethylcellulose. The peptides are basic molecules with molecular weights in the range of 7000 for which the amino acid compositions and sequences were determined. The effect of the purified peptides on pancreatic exocrine secretion in the guinea pig was studied. Biochemical measurements show that the cells are stimulated by these peptides to discharge their zymogen granules. Light and electron microscopic images confirm the biochemical measurements. At the light microscope level, acinar cells show dramatically fewer zymogen granules than in control pancreas with the appearance of large vacuoles and some loss of morphological integrity. Electron micrographs display apical regions devoid of zymogen granules and condensing vacuoles whereas acinar lumina contain crystalline secretory material. The secretory effect observed in vitro is comparable to that of carbamylcholine and that of the peptidergic secretagogue cholecystokinin-pancreozymin."

The effect was stereospecific with respect to the clinically active and inactive isomers of flupenthixol. Synthesis of the 30-kDa polypeptide appears therefore to be correlated with antipsychotic properties but not with DA receptor binding. It is possible that such effects may be associated with the clinically beneficial effect of antipsychotic drugs in the brain."

        "abstract": "Peritoneal fluid was analysed from 17 foals, aged 13 to 134 days with a mean age of 68 days. Cytologically, the peritoneal fluid was characterised by a mean total cell count of 0.45 x 10(9)/litre (range 0.06 to 1.42 x 10(9)/litre), rare eosinophils, rare cytophagia and variable percentages of neutrophils and mononuclear cells. These data indicate that peritoneal fluid nucleated cell counts over 1.50 x 10(9)/litre in the foal should be interpreted as elevated. Biochemical evaluation revealed a mean biuret protein level of 12 g/litre, mean refractive index protein level of 16 g/litre and urea nitrogen concentration of 1.96 mmol/litre. There was no correlation between the foals' white blood cell and peritoneal fluid nucleated cell counts. Results of this study indicate that adult horse reference values for evaluation of peritoneal fluid are of questionable validity for foals. Diagnostically, the most important observation was that maximum peritoneal fluid nucleated cell counts in healthy foals were much lower than reported maximal reference values for adult horses (1.5 x 10(9)/litre versus 5.0 x 10(9)/litre or 10.0 x 10(9)/litre)."

By means of a questionnaire constructed for the purpose, certain characteristics of fetal malformation and of pregnancy were evidenced, as well as the way these were experienced by the patients. The immediate and delayed reactions to the diagnosis of malformation were also studied, as was the experience lived when faced with the choice of abortion."

In a previous study, we cloned and sequenced the testosterone-inducible betahsd gene from C. testosteroni (Genti-Raimondi, S., Tolmasky, M., Patrito, L., Flury, A. and Actis, L., Molecular cloning and expression of the beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase gene from Pseudomonas testosteroni. Gene, 1991, 105, 43-49.). Herein we report the cloning and characterization of another steroid-inducible gene (stdC), located 2400 bp upstream of betahsd. Nucleotide sequencing of a region encompassing the stdC gene revealed an open reading frame 546 bp long including the stop codon TGA with significant similarity to the orf4, orf1 and orf4 of unknown function described in the polyhydroxyalkanoic acid (PHA) cluster of Chromatium vinosum, Rhizobium meliloti and Thiocystis violacea, respectively. The aminoacid sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence predicts a putative protein of 181 amino acids with a molecular weight of 20715 Da. Northern blot experiments indicate that the stdC gene was transcribed as a monocistronic mRNA with an apparent molecular size of 670 nt. The stdC transcript was abundant in C. testosteroni cells grown with different steroid carbon sources harvested in the exponential phase and was found to be under catabolite repression."

        "abstract": "The effects of endurance training (running 1 h/day at 35 m/min, 10% grade) on glucose homeostasis during exercise (running 20 m/min) was studied in 30-h fasted rats. Primed-continuous infusion of [6-3H]- and [U-14C]glucose were employed to assess rates of appearance (Ra), disappearance (Rd), and apparent recycling. Training resulted in a 65% increase in skeletal muscle succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity but did not significantly influence body weight. Resting blood glucose concentrations were not significantly different between controls, 5.01 +/- 0.19 mM, and trained animals, 4.86 +/- 0.16 mM. Exercise resulted in a more rapid decline in blood glucose levels for control animals, reaching a value of 2.35 +/- 0.39 mM at 60 min, compared with 3.69 +/- 0.47 mM for trained animals. Glucose Ra was not significantly different between groups at rest, and rose for both groups during exercise. However, for controls Ra plateaued between 15 and 60 min of exercise at 11.03 +/- 0.73 mumol.100 g-1.min-1, whereas trained animals demonstrated a continuous rise to 17.13 +/- 1.18 mumol.100 g-1.min-1. Glucose Rd values were not significantly different between groups during the first 30 min of exercise but were significantly higher for trained animals during the final 30 min. As a result of the higher glucose Ra, trained animals demonstrated a smaller mean difference between Ra and Rd during exercise when compared with controls, -0.27 +/- 0.14 vs. -0.96 +/- 0.17 mumol.100 g-1.min-1. Trained animals further demonstrated significantly higher rates of glucose carbon recycling during the final 30 min of exercise.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

        "abstract": "Thirty-five patients with trigeminal neuralgia underwent microvascular decompression. Complete remission was obtained in 33 patients, while one was fair and another unchanged postoperatively. The clinical and operative findings were reviewed, analyzing the direction of vascular compression of the trigeminal nerve and the distribution of pain in the peripheral regions. There were some weak correlations between the direction of vascular compression and the distribution of pain. Neuralgia in the region of second branch of the trigeminal nerve (V2) or in the regions of V2 and third branch of the nerve (V3) was caused by compression from the ventral or ventro-rostral direction, in the region of first branch of the nerve from the ventro-caudal direction, and in the V3 region from the ventral, rostral, and dorsal directions of the nerve in general. In two patients who had had complete remission after first operation, trigeminal neuralgia recurred. They had typical intermittent painful attacks with a background of continuous dull pain or painful dysesthesia caused by Ivalon sponges inserted between the nerve and the offending vessel. Complete remission was again obtained after removal of these sponge pieces. We would like to stress continuous dull pain or painful dysesthesia in cases of delayed recurrence as indicators for re-exploration."

        "article_title": "Betel-nut chewing may aggravate asthma.",
        "abstract": "A questionnaire survey on the relationship between chewing betel nut and asthma was carried out in 61 asthmatic patients who regularly attend a follow-up clinic at Port Moresby General Hospital. 54 of these had once chewed or were still chewing betel nut; 20 patients had already given it up, while 34 were still regular or occasional chewers. 7 patients had never chewed. 11 of the 20 patients who used to chew but had given up reported having stopped because of aggravation of their asthma. 22 of the 34 patients who still chewed also reported aggravation of their asthma by betel nut. Anecdotal reports were given directly linking specified methods of chewing the nut with asthma aggravation, in some cases indicating dose-response (toxicity) relationships. While more elaborate and objective studies are being undertaken, it is hereby suggested that patients with asthma be cautioned against chewing betel nut."

        "abstract": "We studied cognitive function and metabolic status in a group of healthy adolescents fed the government supplied breakfast (n = 18) versus a control group (n = 16) fed a very low calorie meal. Serum glucose and beta-hydroxybutyrate levels were repeatedly measured at predetermined intervals throughout the testing period. Acute cognitive and mood effect were evaluated in all subjects on a pre-post basis. No significant group differences emerged on a battery of psychological measures that assessed short-term auditory memory, vigilance, impulsivity, and mood. Neither serum glucose or beta-hydroxybutyrate levels correlated significantly with any behavioral measure. Results are discussed in the context of previous studies of nutrition and cognition."

        "article_title": "The fidelity of protein synthesis: can mischarging by aspartyl-tRNA(Asp) synthetase lead to the formation of isoaspartyl residues in proteins?",
        "abstract": "We have tested the hypothesis that isoaspartic acid residues in proteins can arise via errors that occur during protein synthesis. One such error involves a mischarging step in which the aspartic acid side-chain beta-carboxyl group is linked to the tRNA(Asp) instead of the main chain alpha-carboxyl group. If this altered Asp-tRNA(Asp) is a substrate for the ribosomal elongation reactions, a polypeptide will be made with an isoaspartic acid, or beta-linkage, in which the peptide chain is branched at the side chain of the aspartic acid residue. Using an ammonium sulfate fraction of aspartyl-tRNA(Asp) synthetase from Escherichia coli and [3H]aspartic acid, we have prepared [3H]aspartyl-tRNA(Asp) complexes and directly analyzed the linkage of the [3H]aspartate to the tRNA by identifying the products of ammonolysis. Normal attachment of the alpha-carboxyl group of aspartate to the tRNA produces [3H]isoasparagine, while the mischarging reaction leads to [3H]asparagine formation after ammonolysis. We have separated [3H]isoasparagine from [3H]asparagine and found an upper limit of 1 asparagine per 10,000 isoasparagines. These results show that the bacterial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase can very accurately distinguish between the alpha- and beta-carboxyl groups of aspartic acid and suggest that only a very small fraction of the isoaspartic acid residues found to occur in cellular proteins may be the result of mischarging steps."

        "abstract": "In our study of 1326 autopsied cases of congenital heart disease, we have encountered 3 cases of atresia of the common pulmonary vein. This is a rare condition of which, to the best part of our knowledge, only 19 cases have been reported so far. Interestingly, two of our cases were associated with isomerism of the right atrial appendages, and one also had a common arterial trunk. The association with isomerism of the right appendages, and with absence of the spleen, has been observed previously but no previous case of which we are aware has had a common arterial trunk. Atresia of the common pulmonary vein is part of the spectrum related to totally anomalous pulmonary venous connexion, a lesion known to be frequently associated with isomerism of the right atrial appendages. Atresia of the common pulmonary vein, however, has not commonly been found with isomerism of the right appendages."

        "abstract": "This study was designed to ascertain whether any benefit would be derived from aspirating ovarian cysts identified before ovarian stimulation in patients undergoing in vitro fertilization. Thirty-seven patients who had ovarian cysts were categorized into two groups: group A (n = 14) with baseline ovarian cysts and group B (n = 23) with ovarian cysts that developed during pituitary suppression with the gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog. Each group was prospectively randomized into two subgroups depending on whether the ovarian cysts were aspirated or not. In group A, there was a significantly greater number of follicles and oocytes in the ovaries in which cysts were aspirated. However, there was no significant difference in the total number of follicles, oocytes retrieved and fertilized, or in the final outcome. In group B, there was no significant difference in folliculogenesis between the aspirated and nonaspirated subgroups. These observations suggest that the presence of a baseline ovarian cyst may reduce folliculogenesis but do not support routine cyst aspiration if the patient has two functional ovaries."

        "abstract": "Despite improvements in exploratory methods and the introduction of endoscopic haemostasis procedures, bleeding remains a severe complication of peptic ulcers. A retrospective study of 142 cases collected over a 10-year period showed an overall mortality rate of 12.76 percent: 9.2 percent in non surgical patients and 17.1 percent in patients operated upon. The latter figure fell to 9 percent when cirrhotic patients were excluded. The criteria required for surgical treatment and the choice of the most appropriate operative technique are defined. In elderly people and/or in patients with underlying diseases, when the blood pressure is kept stable the risk of surgery is lower than the risk of cardiovascular collapse. This type of surgery is justified only if it eliminates all risk of recurrent bleeding."

The sequence consists of 3662 nucleotides and contains a single long open reading frame sufficient to code for a protein of 113,353 Da. The proteolytic processing sites within this protein have been identified by comparison with the known three-dimensional structure of the virion and cleavage at these sites would lead to a range of products consistent with those observed during processing of the M RNA-encoded polyproteins in vitro. We have performed computer-aided searches for reiterated sequences within BPMV M RNA which might explain why ordered RNA is visible in the electron density map of BPMV middle component particles (Chen, Z., Stauffacher, C. V., Li, Y., Schmidt, T., Bomu, W., Kamer, G., Shanks, M., Lomonossoff, G., and Johnson, J. E., 1989, Science 245, 154-159). These searches revealed both the presence of overrepresented pentameric sequences and a consensus sequence which was repeated 15 times within the RNA sequence."

Cell proliferation was studied in vitro in sequential analysis every 5 h in cultures from 20 to 40 h of incubation. Results show a longer generation cycle in malnourished rat cells, revealing a delay in cell proliferation. Cells of this group of animals showed a higher percentage of first-cycle metaphases and lacked third-cycle metaphases even after 40 h of culture. This shows that the damage caused to cells of undernourished organisms used in this experiment persists even when they are placed in a nutrient-rich medium. The SCE frequency did not show differences between malnourished rats and their controls."

        "abstract": "Seven male volunteers were exposed to atmospheric concentrations of either 1980, 4100 or 7630 mg m-3 1,1,2-trichloro-1,2,2-trifluoroethane (FC113) for 4 h. Blood and expired air samples were collected during the exposure period and for several days subsequently and analysed for FC113. Blood and breath concentrations of FC113 were related to the administered dose with some variation between individuals. The low blood/breath ratios measured are consistent with the low solubility of FC113 in blood. The absorption and elimination of FC113 can be described by a three-compartment model and the average half-lives of elimination of FC113 in breath were 0.22, 2.3 and 29 h. A pulmonary retention during the exposure period of 14% was measured but only 2.6 to 4.3% of the dose was recovered unchanged in breath after the exposure period, suggesting that FC113 could be metabolised following inhalation exposure. It is concluded that a practical method for biological monitoring during occupational exposure would be to measure end-tidal breath concentrations of FC113 in samples taken the morning after exposure. The predictive value of such a measurement can be improved if the results are normalised to the body fat content of individual workers which can be estimated from height and weight measurements."

        "abstract": "Tebufelone (formerly NE-11740) is a member of the new class of di-tert-butyl-phenol anti-inflammatory agents. It has previously been reported that this new agent has potent analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory effects using in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo experimental models. A randomized, active- and placebo- controlled double-blinded study in 120 healthy males, 20 to 55 years old, was conducted to clinically assess tebufelone's antipyretic activity. Subjects received a single peroral dose of placebo, 650 mg aspirin (ASA), or tebufelone at doses of 25, 50, 100, or 200 mg. Thirty minutes later, E. coli endotoxin (2 ng/kg) was administered intravenously. Oral temperatures were recorded at 15 minute intervals from 30 minutes post dosing to 8 hours post endotoxin administration. Areas under the temperature curves (AUCs), adjusted for baseline, were significantly lower than placebo for ASA and all but the 25 mg tebufelone groups. An AUC dose-response equation estimates 60 mg tebufelone as equivalent to 650 mg ASA, with 50 mg tebufelone not significantly greater than 650 mg ASA. Side effects, attributable to the endotoxin, included mild flu-like symptoms and were worse in the placebo group and the non-efficacious 25 mg tebufelone group. Doses of 100 and 200 mg tebufelone had onset characteristics indistinguishable from 650 mg ASA, whereas 50 mg tebufelone showed significantly slower onset while suppressing temperature for a longer period than ASA. These results provide an important early demonstration of tebufelone's biological activity in man."

        "abstract": "Studies were conducted to assess the ability of the thymic polypeptide hormone thymopoietin (TPO) to interact with proto-typical ganglia-type or muscle-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ion channels (nAcChoR). Also investigated were interactions of TPO with neuronal nicotinic alpha-bungarotoxin binding sites (nBgtS), which share many features with nAcChoR and may belong to an extended nAcChoR family but do not appear to function as simple ligand-gated ion channels. TPO and alpha-bungarotoxin (Bgt) share the capacity for high affinity (IC50 values in the nanomolar range) interaction with nBgtS, which are expressed as high affinity radioiodinated Bgt binding sites by cells of the SH-SY5Y or IMR-32 human neuroblastomas. TPO and Bgt also share the capacity for high affinity interaction with muscle-type nAcChoR, which are expressed as high affinity binding sites for radioiodinated Bgt or tritium-labeled acetylcholine by cells of the TE671/RD human clone or the BC3H-1 mouse muscle cell line or on membrane preparations from Torpedo electroplax. TPO and Bgt act acutely as high affinity antagonists of muscle-type nAcChoR functional responses, which are measured using an isotopic rubidium ion efflux assay, on TE671/RD or BC3H-1 cells. In contrast, neither TPO nor Bgt are effective, at doses of up to 1 microM, as antagonists of ganglia-type nAcChoR function on SH-SY5Y or IMR-32 cells, nor are they potent as inhibitors of high affinity tritium-labeled acetylcholine binding to sites on putative ganglia-type nAcChoR expressed by SH-SY5Y or IMR-32 cells. These data indicate that some members of the extended nAcChoR family, including nBgtS and functional muscle-type nAcChoR but not ganglia-type nAcChoR, can interact with either Bgt or TPO. The results suggest that TPO may be an endogenous ligand active in both the nervous and immune systems and that some of its actions may be mediated via nBgtS or via functional blockade of muscle-type nAcChoR."

Sagittal plane was most preferable from the result of preliminary study using a dry temporal bone. In all of ten normal volunteers, VAs were visualized well. In none of them, proton-density weighted spin-echo (SE) images were inferior to both T1- and T2-weighted SE image. In four of eight patients with Meni\u00e8re's disease, VAs were not visualized due to obstruction of VA, although in all of ten non-Meni\u00e8re's patients with hearing loss or vertigo, VAs were well visualized. Although further investigation is needed, MR imaging of VA including both its content and surrounding bony structure would give important information to manage the patients with either Meni\u00e8re's disease or other disorders of internal ears."

A method was devised to quantify meniscus displacement in terms of the number of degrees from a 12 o'clock or vertical position (relative to the condyle). The distribution of meniscus positions defined two groups in this asymptomatic study group. A strong correlation between abnormal joints and a history of orthodontics led to the exclusion of subjects with a history of orthodontics, and those with mouth trauma were also excluded, leaving a better \"normal control\" group. The junction of the posterior band of the meniscus and the bilaminar zone should fall within 10 degrees of vertical to be within the 95th percentile of normal."

P) were investigated in dogs with acute obstructive hydrocephalus, and they were compared with those of 20% mannitol or 10% glycerol in 5% fructose and 0.9% saline. Animals were divided into 5 groups (n = 6 in each group) and treated with either NIK-242 inj. (0.5 g/kg, 1.0 g/kg, 2.0 g/kg), mannitol (1.0 g/kg) or glycerol (0.5 g/kg). These drugs were administrated intravenously for 10 min. NIK-242 inj. rapidly reduced ICP and increased Osm. P. There was correlation between changes of ICP and Osm. P. The regression equation was Y = -6.489 X + 726.206 (n = 104, p less than 0.00001, R = -0.655). The effects were dose-dependent, but there were no significant differences between the effects of NIK-242 inj. 1.0 g/kg infusion and 2.0 g/kg infusion. The most appropriate dose of NIK-242 inj. was 1.0 g/kg, in which group ICP was significantly lower than the initial pressure until 120 minutes after administration (p less than 0.05). The maximum reduction rate of ICP [(initial ICP-minimum ICP)/initial ICP X 100] was 83.6 +/- 10.6% at 22.7 +/- 3.0 min. after administration. It was 61.6 +/- 6.9% at 19.3 +/- 1.6 min. in mannitol group and 77.1 +/- 7.4% at 15.0 +/- 0.8 min. in glycerol group. There was no rebound phenomenon on ICP during 150 min., but there was one in mannitol group and five in glycerol group. NIK-242 inj.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

A random sample of 688 individuals was chosen and approached regarding participation in the study. Data were gathered through an interviewer-administered questionnaire and an oral examination. A total of 204 individuals completed all aspects of the study. Only one participant had all 28 natural teeth, while 58.3 percent were totally endentulous. Of the 85 dentate participants, almost 53 percent required at least one extraction. The average number of required extractions in the dentate subjects was three. Although 94 percent of the sample stated they had a usual source of dental care, 40.7 percent had not visited a dentist within the last five years. Multiple regression analyses were used to determine the factors associated with total number of teeth present among the dentate participants. Years of education and time since last dental visit were the two significant predictors (P less than .05) of number of teeth present. The higher the level of education, the greater the number of teeth in later life. The number of teeth present was inversely related to years since dental treatment. Compared to the results of the National Survey of Oral Health in US Employed Adults and Seniors, this Native American sample had a higher prevalence of endentulism and utilized dental services less often than a comparable age group in the US population as a whole."

Between 8 and 23 weeks of age, 33 (51.5%) of 64 surviving pigs seroconverted to A pleuropneumoniae serovar 7. Peak antibody concentrations in the seroconverting pigs usually (28/33) occurred at 23 weeks. Seroconversion to A pleuropneumoniae during the grower/finisher phase was not significantly associated (p greater than 0.05) with passive antibody concentrations at 4 weeks of age, lack of vaccination against Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, or weaning weight. Pleuropneumonic lesions were evident at slaughter in 4 (6.3%) of 64 pigs. A pleuropneumoniae serovar 7 was isolated from 2 of 4 lungs with pleuropneumonia and from another lung with lesions considered typical of enzootic pneumonia."

        "abstract": "Policy and procedure manuals are now commonly used in hospitals. The policy and procedure manual provides critical care nurses with a wealth of information. Policies are developed to guide the staff to perform nursing care adequately. Together policies and the corresponding procedures let critical care nurses know how to proceed to meet the organisation and the unit goals. As critical care expands the number of policies increases, which may make it more difficult to find a specific policy quickly. Critical care nurses need to look at other solutions for communicating some necessary pieces of information and check to make sure that policy is stated briefly, to the point and logical. It is also necessary to check to see if the information included in the manual is policy and associated procedures. If it is drug information, equipment usage, standards of care, or patient/family teaching material it could be incorporated in a different format or separate manual. As care givers nurses must monitor policies and procedures that are written and make sure they are simple to read, logically written, and easy to find."

The tissue type of CK-MM3 isoform was completely inhibited, MM2 isoform was about 57% and the serum type of CK-MM1 isoform was not inhibited by use of monoclonal antibody. This method enabled selective immunoinhibitory measurement of tissue type of CK-MM isoform. The heat lability and inhibition by EDTA suggested that it is a metal-depending enzyme. The analysis of MM isoform offers a promising alternate, non-invasive method to detect and follow up AMI and successful reperfusion. The MM3/MM1 ratio has been found to peak at about 2 to 6 hours, making it a quicker responding parameter to AMI than MM3 alone and significantly more responsive than the total CK or CK-MB. An MM3/MM1 ratio greater than 1.0 appears to be a practical cutoff point for detection of the pathological release of MM3 from tissue. Reperfusion therapy should be instituted within about 2 to 4 hours of AMI onset."

        "abstract": "Because C-reactive protein (CRP) has been identified as a component of circulating immune complexes from patients with inflammatory diseases, we sought to evaluate a potentially clinically important interaction of this acute-phase protein with immunoglobulin or experimentally-prepared immune complexes in vitro. Highly purified human CRP was incubated with a variety of immunoglobulin substrates, including monomeric immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1), a polyclonal IgG, heat-aggregated IgG, and human serum albumin/anti-serum albumin complexes. We were unable to detect a significant binding interaction of radioiodinated CRP with any of these materials, using either polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation or sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation. In contrast, binding of radioiodinated human C1q to both aggregated immunoglobulin and immune complexes was readily detected by these techniques. Incubation of radiolabeled CRP with serum samples from 22 patients with active inflammatory diseases and high levels of circulating immune complexes disclosed no difference in the amount of PEG-precipitable CRP when compared with serum samples from healthy individuals. However, a radiolabeled commercial preparation of CRP did result in some PEG-precipitable radioactivity after incubation with aggregated IgG. These findings provide no support for a biologically important binding interaction of CRP with immunoglobulin or immune complexes, and they suggest that highly purified preparations of CRP should be used in functional studies of this acute-phase protein."

Compared with a control collective of 70 healthy persons in the same age the epileptics showed a reduction of all NCVs. 19 percent of the epileptic collective had at least 1 diminished NCV. Negative correlations with total amount and average daily dose of antiepileptic drugs were found in both sexes for sensory NCV of median nerve and motor NCV of peroneal nerve, only in males also for motor NCV of median nerve. Only in females, duration of therapy correlated negative with sensory NCV of median and motor NCV of peroneal nerve. In patients under monotherapy the group with carbamazepine treatment showed the lowest NCV values, the difference being significant for motor NCV of median nerve in comparison to phenytoin and valproate sodium. It is concluded, that NCV generally is lowered under long term treatment with antiepileptic drugs and that phenytoin has no specific influence compared with the other drugs."

        "abstract": "Xenopus follicles consist of a single large oocyte surrounded by a monolayer of follicle cells attached to the oocyte by gap junctions. Adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) activates an outward K+ current which is completely abolished if follicle cells are removed or if phorbol esters (which have been reported to reduce gap junctional conductance) are added. In this study we show that phorbol esters do not reduce cAMP levels in follicles and that acid pH, another known stimulus for reducing gap junctional conductance, mimics the action of phorbol esters to inhibit the cAMP-stimulated K+ current. We also examined electrical coupling between oocytes of pairs of follicles placed in physical contact (across 2 oocyte-follicle cell and 1 follicle cell-follicle cell gap junction). Phorbol esters and acid pH (5.5-6.5) decreased electrical coupling without eliciting a shunt current, since slope conductance of current-voltage curves recorded during voltage clamp was simultaneously decreased. Increasing cAMP, which has been reported to enhance gap junctional conductance in mammalian cells, increased slope conductance without decreasing electrical coupling between pairs of follicles. The data suggest that cAMP increases and phorbol esters and acid pH decrease K+ currents at least in part by effects on gap junctions. The effects of phorbol esters and acid pH to reduce electrical coupling between oocytes cannot be due to blockade of K+ channels, since such an action would increase electrical coupling (as verified by computer simulations). These findings are consistent with the idea that cAMP-activated K+ currents originate in follicle cells and are communicated to the oocyte via gap junctions."

The relation between the lymphoproliferative response and the antibody levels to these antigens was studied. The results confirm the existence of T-cell epitopes within the repeat sequences of the CS protein and the Pfl55/RESA capable of inducing lymphocyte proliferation. Cellular response to all studied peptides was more frequently observed in individuals living in France for less than one year than in individuals living in France for a longer time. T-cell proliferation in the presence of the tetrapeptide and of the octapeptide from the C-terminus repeat of Pfl55/RESA was related, with an immunodominance of the tetrapeptide over the octapeptide. Cellular responses to the CS protein repeat and to the 11-amino-acid peptide from the Pfl55/RESA N-terminus were the longest lasting after termination of exposure. In a given individual, cellular and humoral responses were not related for any peptide studied."

        "abstract": "The striving after perfection has been often mentioned in clinical literature; however, there have been few systematic analyses of the concept. In the present study, a questionnaire measure of Perfectionism and General Dissatisfaction (the SCANS) together with the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire and measures thought to gauge aspects of perfectionistic thinking, were administered to a mixed group of 148 subjects, including 25 eating disorder patients. Perfectionism was found to correlate negatively with Psychoticism (as measured by the EPQ) and positively with the Lie scale. Thus Perfectionism appears to be associated with a tendency to deny personally deviant behaviour and to present oneself in the best possible light. It is also associated with greater accuracy in a visual search task. General Dissatisfaction was correlated significantly with Neuroticism, Introversion and Psychoticism. It thus appears to be related to a combination of 'neurotic introversion' and 'personality deviance'. It is also associated with a tendency to be under-inclusive, that is to find difficulty in ruling out irrelevant stimuli when forming categories. Dissatisfaction was also associated with increased reaction time in the visual search task, perhaps also a reflection of an inability to ignore irrelevant stimuli. Only the EPQ N and P scales successfully differentiated neurotic or dissatisfied perfectionists from normal or satisfied perfectionists, although several measures derived from the visual search task produced results which were approaching significance."

        "abstract": "The platelet plasma membrane is lined by a membrane skeleton that appears to contain short actin filaments cross-linked by actin-binding protein. Actin-binding protein is in turn associated with specific plasma membrane glycoproteins. The aim of this study was to determine whether the membrane skeleton regulates properties of the plasma membrane. Platelets were incubated with agents that disrupted the association of the membrane skeleton with membrane glycoproteins. The consequences of this change on plasma membrane properties were examined. The agents that were used were ionophore A23187 and dibucaine. Both agents activated calpain (the Ca2(+)-dependent protease), resulting in the hydrolysis of actin-binding protein and decreased association of actin with membrane glycoproteins. Disruption of actin-membrane interactions was accompanied by the shedding of procoagulant-rich microvesicles from the plasma membrane. The shedding of microvesicles correlated with the hydrolysis of actin-binding protein and the disruption of actin-membrane interactions. When the calpain-induced disruption of actin-membrane interactions was inhibited, the shedding of microvesicles was inhibited. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that association of the membrane skeleton with the plasma membrane maintains the integrity of the plasma membrane, preventing the shedding of procoagulant-rich microvesicles from the membrane of unstimulated platelets. They raise the possibility that the procoagulant-rich microvesicles that are released under a variety of physiological and pathological conditions may result from the dissociation of the platelet membrane skeleton from its membrane attachment sites."

        "abstract": "Acrylamide (ACR), a widely used vinyl monomer, is well known as a neurotoxin to both laboratory animals and man. The experiment reported has demonstrated that ACR induces ultrastructural changes in the parasitic ciliate Nyctotheroides puytoraci, after injecting the host Bufo regularis with 1 mg ACR per toad (single dose). After 1 week of ACR injection, alterations in both nuclear and cytoplasmic organelles were observed. An increase in the number of cisternae of the Golgi complex was visualized which may be due to its division and hence activation. Acrylamide also appeared to cause fusion of mitochondria in the treated trophozoites. Thus trophozoites of these specimens showed a decreased number of irregularly shaped mitochondria with dense matrix and indistinct outer and inner membranes. Such changes may be attributed to a disturbance in mitochondrial protein synthesis. Also, rough endoplasmic reticulum and lysosomes increased in number. The basal cell bodies were degenerated at some sites."

        "abstract": "Based on their relative affinities for cholecystokinin octapeptide (26-33) (CCK-8), cholecystokinin tetrapeptide (30-33) (CCK-4), desulfated CCK-8, and gastrin, cholecystokinin (CCK) receptors have been classified as CCK-A (alimentary) and CCK-B (brain). Selective nonpeptide antagonists of CCK-A and CCK-B receptors, as well as highly selective CCK-A and CCK-B peptide agonists, have been described. We report here the characterization of two novel CCK-4-based peptides, A-71623 and A-70874. In radioligand binding assays, the IC50 values for A-71623 and A-70874 were 3.7 and 4.9 nM in guinea pig pancreas (CCK-A) and 4500 and 710 nM in cerebral cortex (CCK-B), respectively. Both were agonists in stimulating pancreatic amylase release, and their stimulatory effects were potently inhibited by the CCK-A antagonist L-364,718. A-71623 was a full agonist and A-70874 was a partial agonist (approximately 80%) in stimulating phosphoinositide breakdown in pancreas. Both peptides also were potent agonists in stimulating CCK-A receptors in the ileum. They were, however, weak and behaved as partial agonists in calcium studies in NCI-H345 cells, which possess CCK-B/gastrin receptors. In guinea pig gastric glands, the affinities of A-71623 and A-70874 for the CCK-B/gastrin receptor were 11 and 1.6 microM, respectively. These results demonstrate that A-71623 and A-70874 are potent and selective agonists at CCK-A receptors. The preferential interaction of these novel CCK-4 analogs with CCK-A receptors is in contrast to other CCK-4-based peptides, which are primarily selective for CCK-B receptors. In addition, A-71623 and A-70874 are the first two examples of potent CCK-A agonists that do not contain a tyrosine residue whose sulfation is required for potent CCK-A agonist activity of larger peptides."

        "abstract": "The resurgence of tuberculosis and the increased prevalence of atypical mycobacterial infections in immunocompromised subjects have prompted the quest for novel antimycobacterial agents. Fluoroquinolones, such as ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, might be promising agents for treatment of tuberculosis especially multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and infections caused by Mycobacterium fortuitum. Clarithromycin, an important member of the macrolides, has been shown to have activity against some infections due to Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare, M. fortuitum and Mycobacterium chelonae. Rifabutin, being a rifamycin, has been found to be efficacious in treatment of drug-susceptible tuberculosis, although its place in MDR-TB is less certain. Rifabutin in combination with other drugs might constitute active regimens for treatment of disseminated M. avium-intracellulare infections. When used alone, it can be an active prophylactic agent against such infection. Imipenem, a carbapenem, might provide promising treatment for some M. fortuitum and M. chelonae infections. The place of beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations in the treatment of MDR-TB is uncertain. Clofazimine and aminosidine being riminophenazine and aminoglycoside, respectively, might merit further evaluation as potentially useful agents for treatment of MDR-TB and M. avium-intracellulare infections. However, much broader evaluation of all these agents in clinical settings is still definitely required."

        "abstract": "In two experiments, young subjects, healthy elderly subjects (spouses), and highly intelligent elderly subjects (elite elderly), were compared with dementia patients in a variety of explicit and implicit memory tasks, to investigate two issues: whether priming in Alzheimer-type dementia is contingent upon the presence of pre-existing representations, and whether intelligence modulates performance in explicit memory tasks in healthy ageing. Dementia patients performed as well as spouses in a homo-phone-spelling task. Moreover, they established new contextual associations when memory was tested by word-stem completion. The hypothesis that priming in dementia is contingent upon pre-existing memory representations was not supported. Spouses, elite elderly, and young subjects did not differ in their ability to recognize correctly recently heard stimuli or to complete word stems. However, recall of lists of words and paired associates was better in both young and elite elderly subjects than in spouses. It is concluded that intellectual capacity rather than chronological age in healthy subjects modulates performance in explicit-memory tasks."

Mammary anlagen were found in both sexes of both species, but the neonatal males had less than one-third of the full female complement of mammary glands. Male neonates of both species also had paired scrotal bulges anterior to the genital tubercle but these were never present in females, once again raising the question of whether the pouch and scrotum are homologous structures. Mammary anlagen are not found in male neonates of the Australian marsupial species so far studied, which suggests a dichotomy in the control of some aspects of sexual differentiation in the two marsupial lineages."

        "abstract": "We report on the clinical and pathological features of a hitherto unrecognized multicystic and multifocal mesothelial lesion arising in the pleural cavity of a 37-year-old Caucasian woman. The lesions consisted of clusters of thin-walled cysts separated by connective tissue and lined by a single layer of flattened and cuboidal mesothelium. Mucin stains, immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopy were consistent with a mesothelial origin. The pathological features are identical to those of the previously reported multicystic mesotheliomas of the peritoneum. Although these multicystic peritoneal mesothelial lesions have been regarded as neoplasms, absent stromal extension, lack of mitotic activity, and (in this case) continuity with morphologically normal surrounding mesothelium are suggestive of a reactive process. The term \"multicystic mesothelial proliferation\" may therefore be more appropriate. Because these lesions may be detected as discrete pleural based masses on chest radiograph and CT scan, they may be submitted for frozen section during operative resection. It is therefore important to be aware of their existence, morphology, and differential diagnosis."

        "abstract": "The immunologic mechanisms mediated by anticolon antibodies have been suggested for the injury of colonic mucosa in ulcerative colitis (UC). For the understanding of pathogenetic relevance of the anticolon antibody in UC, we examined the class and the subclass of the anticolon antibody reactive to rat colonic epithelial cells in sera from 10 patients with UC immunohistochemically by an indirect immunoperoxidase method. We also examined the distribution of the antigen recognized by the anticolon antibody by immunoelectron microscopy. The antibody reactive to the rat colonic epithelial cell was detected in 2 of the 10 patients, and the class and subclass of the antibody was mainly IgG2. The antigen recognized by the anticolon antibody was located on the apical membrane of the colonic epithelial cells and mucous substances of the goblet cells. These findings suggest that the anticolon antibody detected in this study is inadequate to cause the colonic mucosal injury by activating complements or mediating antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. A potential pathogenetic role of the anticolon antibody in UC remains to be established."

        "abstract": "The effect of recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) on the immune system of hemodialysis patients has been studied by evaluating their response to hepatitis B (HB) vaccination. Fifty hemodialysis patients were given four doses of 20 micrograms recombinant DNA hepatitis B vaccine (SKF) at an interval of 0, 1, 2 and 6 months. Thirty-seven patients could be evaluated at one year. Twelve of 15 (80%) of the rHuEPO treated patients and 12 of 22 (54%) of non-rHuEPO treated dialysis patients developed anti-HBs antibodies. At the time of maximum immune response (8 months), the geometric mean anti-HBs titers (mIU/ml +/- SEM) of responders and all patients were five times (224.0 +/- 5.9 vs. 41.7 +/- 1.5, P less than 0.001), and eight times (57.6 +/- 8.7 vs. 6.7 +/- 1.8, P less than 0.05), respectively, higher in rHuEPO treated patients than in patients not receiving the drug. High antibody response (greater than 100 mIU/ml) prevailed in the group of rHuEPO treated patients and was associated with a high helper/suppressor ratio. Discriminant multivariate analysis (P = 0.038) revealed the influence of treatment with rHuEPO (40%) and helper/suppressor ratio (31%) on antibody concentration, while age, gender, duration of dialysis and previous blood transfusions were similar in both patient groups. Although changes in lymphocyte subsets observed in rHuEPO treated patients may be the result of a reduced administration of blood transfusions, immune reactivity seems also to be directly affected by the drug."

        "abstract": "The recent development of rDNA vectors for transformation of Tetrahymena combined with improved microinjection technology should lead to a renewed interest in this organism. In particular, the rDNA itself constitutes an attractive system for biochemical studies. The rDNA is amplified to a level of 2% of the total DNA and exists as extrachromosomal molecules. Furthermore, the rDNA is homogeneous in sequence because it is derived from a single gene during sexual reorganization. In order to facilitate studies of this molecule, we report here a compilation of previously published sequence information together with new sequence data that completes the entire sequence of the 21 kb rDNA molecule."

They were assigned either to group A (n = 10, Cellsaver [Haemonetics]), B (n = 189, centrifugated oxygenator blood), C (n = 107, retransfusion of shed mediastinal blood) or D (n = 74, combination of method B and C). In addition, blood quality was studied prospectively in group A (n = 5), B (n = 10) and C (n = 10) and each group compared to a control group. Results (mean values/patient) were: Blood salvage with A yielded 570 +/- 230 ml (hematocrit = 50%), B 509 +/- 156 ml (69%) and C 593 +/- 430 ml (26%). The required homologous blood products, i.e. packed cells (PC) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) diminished significantly when combined autologous blood salvage was used (PC 6.0 +/- 3.4 vs 3.4 +/- 1.9, p less than 0.05; FFP 3.4 +/- 3.8 vs 2.6 +/- 3.0). Autologous erythrocyte function assessed by 2,3DPG was normal in all three methods (range 14.77-16.03 mumol/gHb). ATP was nearly normal in A (3.34 +/- 0.45 mumol/gHb), reduced by 20% in B (3.21 +/- 1.14 mumol/gHb) and by 30% in C (2.56 +/- 0.78 mumol/gHb) compared to the corresponding preoperative patient value. Hemolysis (free plasma hemoglobin) (was elevated in A (63 +/- 7 mg/dl), B (202 +/- 57 mg/dl) and C (211 +/- 44 mg/dl). However, no increase of free plasma hemoglobin was encountered in our patients after retransfusion of either A, B or C. No side effects were detected and bacteriology remained negative in all examined blood samples in C.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

        "abstract": "We assessed the contribution of ATP and adenosine (i) to a major sign of acute inflammation, plasma extravasation (PE), in the rat knee joint and (ii) to the severity of joint injury in adjuvant-induced experimental arthritis, a chronic inflammatory disease. PE induced by local infusion of bradykinin, which we have previously shown to depend on the sympathetic postganglionic neuron terminal, was markedly enhanced by coinfusion of either ATP or the adenosine A2-receptor agonist 2-[4-(2-carboxyethyl)phenylethylamino]-5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenos ine. Bradykinin-induced PE was inhibited by coinfusion of the ATP receptor antagonist adenosine 5'-[alpha,beta-methylene]triphosphate, the A2-receptor antagonist 3-(5H-thiozolo[2,3b]quinazolin-3-yl)phenol monohydrochloride, or the adenosine A1-receptor agonist N6-cyclopentyladenosine. The joint injury associated with experimental arthritis, which is reduced in severity in sympathectomized rats, was also markedly attenuated by daily administration of either ATP (40% reduction) or adenosine (55% reduction). These results demonstrate that the purines ATP and adenosine (acting at the A2 receptor), cotransmitters in the sympathetic postganglionic neuron terminal, enhance bradykinin-induced sympathetic postganglionic neuron terminal-dependent PE but inhibit the joint injury of arthritis. These opposing purinergic effects on PE and joint injury suggest that enhanced PE protects against joint injury."

Cholic acid disappearance rate from the perfusate was the fastest, followed by that of ursodeoxycholic and chenodeoxycholic; it was also faster for taurine-conjugated bile acids than for their respective unconjugated forms. The recovery in bile was higher for conjugated than for unconjugated bile acids, and among each class, was higher for cholic than for chenodeoxycholic and ursodeoxycholic. The hepatic uptake correlated negatively (r = -0.99) with the bile acid lipophilicity, while the biliary secretion correlated with the solubility of the molecules. These results show the effect of the physicochemical properties of BA on their hepatic handling, at the physiological concentration of BA in the portal blood."

Thymus cells were incubated 6 hr or in the presence of hydrocortisone, labeled with Acridine orange, and the DNA content of each nuclei was estimated by cytofluorimetry. The results indicate that hydrocortisone-induced DNA fragmentation can be prevented by adding the protein kinase-C inhibitor H-7 to the cell suspension. Incubation of the H-A 1004, an inhibitor of c-AMP-dependent protein kinase, with low effect on on protein kinase-C, did not interfere with the cortisone-mediated DNA fragmentation. Therefore, it can be concluded that protein kinase-C plays an important role in the process of lympholysis mediated by corticoids."

        "abstract": "To test the validity of the maximum parsimony approach to discern protistan interrelationships, we have derived an optimal network of 16S-like rRNA sequences using our parsimony algorithm and compared it with those reported using the distance matrix method. We have also derived an optimal network topology of 50 5S rRNA sequences through an interactive search using our algorithm. In both these networks, the kinetoplastids and euglenoids form a linkage group with Dictyostelium emerging from its neighbourhood. The cryptophytes, dinoflagellates and chromophytes and green algae emerge as independent lines suggesting that plastids arose more than once during protistan evolution. The large 5S rRNA tree further indicates independent origins of mesozoa and metazoa; kinetoplastids and ciliates; and diphyletic origin of fungi. Comparatively close positions of charales and land plants, chytrids and Zygomycetes, Physarum and amoeba, and red algae and green algae are also seen in this network."

        "abstract": "Diarrhea is a common illness among children in day-care centers (DCC). We hypothesized that the incidence of diarrhea was greater among children in their first 1 or 2 months after enrollment in a DCC than in any subsequent period in day care. We followed 442 children younger than 2 years of age enrolled in 13 randomly selected DCCs for the occurrence of diarrhea during a 14 1/2-month period. Parents completed standardized baseline questionnaires and research nurses visited the DCC twice weekly to record the occurrence of diarrhea and to collect stool specimens. Incidence rates, rate ratios, chi square statistics and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for crude and stratified analyses. The diarrheal incidence rate of 4.4 cases/child-year in the first 4 weeks in the centers was significantly (rate ratio, 1.6; confidence interval, 1.3 to 2.1; P less than 0.01) higher than the 2.7 cases/child-year incidence rate of diarrhea in subsequent weeks. The effects of gender, ethnicity, age, DCC size, previous DCC attendance and season were examined and did not account for the association observed between recent enrollement and risk of diarrheal illness. Rotavirus was identified in 18% of cases of diarrhea, but no association was seen with recent enrollment in DCC. A significantly higher incidence of diarrhea occurred in males compared with females (P less than 0.002) and in younger children (P less than 0.001) compared with older children. Diarrhea is common in children in DCCs and occurs significantly more frequently in children during their first 4 weeks in a DCC."

When a 59-year-old woman was found to have an inoperable cancer of the gallbladder, she was subjected to radiotherapy combined with aclarubicin and neocarzinostatin. Therapeutic effectiveness was confirmed at autopsy as she later succumbed to uterine cervical cancer. Thus, the present radiochemotherapeutic regimen would probably provide a means of overcoming those radioresistant inoperable malignancies."

We tested these hypotheses in a sample of 110 freshman medical students. We conducted factor analyses on the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and the state portion of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and then used LISREL to examine the relationships among the various factors. The results indicated that the TAS consists of several independent dimensions and that the dimensions associated with difficulties identifying and communicating feelings are positively related to depression and anxiety. Thus, the evidence now affirms that alexithymia (as measured by the TAS) is multidimensional and that certain dimensions are state dependent."

        "abstract": "The molecular heterogeneity of S. sonnei lipopolysaccharide (LPS), reflecting the size of lateral O-specific polysaccharide chains, has been established by the method of electrophoresis in acrylamide gel in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate and urea. The dominating components fall into three types, viz. those with 0-3, 10-16 and 35-40 repeating structures, the remaining components being minor ones. The electrophoretic profile of S. sonnei LPS considerably differs from the profiles of Escherichia coli and S. flexneri LPS, but coincides with the LPS profiles of other strains with different virulence. The preparations of LPS obtained by extraction with trichloroacetic acid have the same electrophoretic profiles as LPS obtained by the method of aqueous phenol extraction. The domination of certain molecular variants reflects, seemingly, specific features of the biosynthesis of LPS, characteristic of a given strain. The mechanisms of the preferable synthesis of lateral O-specific chains of the definite size and the importance of the molecular parameters of lateral chains for the biological properties of LPS require further study."

Introduction into the bladder may be through self-insertion, iatrogenic means or migration from adjacent organs. Extraction should be tailored according to the nature of the foreign body and should minimise bladder and urethral trauma. Complete extraction should also be confirmed by panendoscopy at the end of the extraction procedure. A 5-year review of our experience in this field has been conducted and the management and complications of intravesical foreign bodies are described. Of the 15 patients presenting to this department, 11 presented acutely and 4 presented with chronic symptoms due to complications which arose later. The possibility of an intravesical foreign body should be considered in any patient with chronic unexplained lower urinary tract symptoms."

        "abstract": "Although the erythroid-specific promoter of human porphobilinogen deaminase [PBGD] gene has no TATA box, transcription is initiated at a single nucleotide. Using 5' and 3' deletions and point mutations, we have identified an element, located around the initiation site, which is necessary and sufficient for 'in vitro' accurate initiation of transcription. This 15 bp element extends 1 bp 5' and 14 bp 3' from the initiation site. It is composed of two regions, a proximal region centred on the cap site and a distal region which bears homology with the TdT initiator element. We show that a nuclear factor, present both in erythroid and non erythroid cells, binds the distal PBGD initiator element. Lack of heat inactivation suggests that initiation of transcription mediated by this element is not TFIID dependent. By transfection into erythroid cells, we also show that the proximal PBGD initiator element is essential for the selection of the initiation site but not for the regulation of transcription of the PBGD erythroid promoter during erythroid differentiation."

        "abstract": "Sharp bends have previously been observed in the tail of the skeletal myosin molecule at well-defined positions 44, 75 and 135 nm from the head-tail junction, and in vertebrate smooth myosin at two positions about 45 and 96 nm from this junction. The amino acid sequence of the heavy chain does not straightforwardly account for such bending on the original model of the tail in which an invariant proline residue is present at the head-tail junction and the repeating seven amino acid pattern of hydrophobic residues lies entirely in the tail. Recently, a revised model has been proposed by Rimm et al. in which the first seven to eight heptads lie in the heads. It is shown here that with this model the observed bends in the tail of skeletal myosin coincide with three of the four additional (skip) residues that interrupt the heptad repeat. It is concluded that the skip residues, by causing localized instability of the coiled-coil, are responsible for the bends. Smooth myosin lacks the second of these skip residues explaining the absence of a bend at 75 nm."

Their pathology, immunology, and clinical features overlap, making it necessary to evaluate all possible parameters in reaching definite diagnoses. Methods to identify predominant B- or T-cell populations in order to distinguish the neoplasms from the reactive or prelymphomatous lesions can be readily employed using immunohistochemical techniques on either snap-frozen or paraffin-embedded sections. Flow cytometry can be employed to identify major cell populations and evaluate DNA ploidy. DNA probe techniques and cytogenetic evaluation further define the possible clonality of immunoblastic proliferations. Common sense is a basic index for the initial approach to the problem. The abnormal immune lesions present firm challenges in histological diagnosis and in dealing with the concepts of the disease. The immunoblastic sarcomas must be recognized for their status as high-grade lymphomas and separated from the benign reversible reactions and problematic, potentially fatal abnormal immune processes."

        "article_title": "Mutagenesis by N-nitroso compounds: relationships to DNA adducts, DNA repair, and mutational efficiencies.",
        "abstract": "The relationships between DNA alkylation, DNA repair and mutagenesis by N-nitroso compounds in Salmonella were examined. DNA adducts formed by treatment of the bacteria with N-nitroso compounds were monitored. Critical to the study was establishing which adducts led to mutations. Two methods were employed. In one, correlations in the dose-responses for adducts and mutagenesis were sought. For instance O6-methyl- and -ethyl-guanine, in contrast to other adducts, exhibited thresholds in their accumulation in Salmonella DNA, and mutagenesis at GC base pairs also exhibited the same threshold, suggesting a dependence of mutagenesis on the O6-alkylguanines. In the second method, mutagenesis induced by different mutagens with overlapping adduct spectra was compared. For example, EMS and ENU generate similar ratios of adenine adducts, but only ENU produces thymine adducts, and only ENU induced AT-GC and AT-CG base changes. These observations suggested that ethylthymines led to these mutations. Furthermore, it was found that these mutations were largely dependent on the presence of the plasmid, pKM101, indicating that error-prone repair activity contributes importantly in their processing to mutations. When DNA adducts by N-nitrosopyrrolidine were examined it was found that only one major adduct was detected in an excision-repair-deficient strain, and that this adduct was not present in a repair-proficient strain. Mutagenesis was also greatly reduced in the proficient strain, suggesting that mutagenesis was dependent on this adduct. From the relationships between premutagenic adduct levels and mutagenesis it was possible to calculate estimated values for the mutational efficiencies for several adducts. This calculation assumed an average distribution of adducts and mutations and required knowledge of the target size and the types of mutations that could lead to phenotypic changes. For the unrepaired O6-methyl- and -ethyl-guanines, and the O-ethylthymines the mutational efficiencies were high (ca. 30-70%), but for the N-nitrosopyrrolidine adduct it was low (ca. 1%). Initial studies were carried out on the mutational specificities of two higher homologue N-nitroso compounds (the N-nitroso-N-propyl- and N-butyl-nitroguanidines) in uvrB/pKM101 strains. This class of nitroso compounds is known to form similar DNA adducts as ENU. Their specificities were similar to that of N-nitroso-N-ethylurea at a high dose except the fraction of mutations at AT base pairs was reduced. The fraction of GC-CG transversions was although low, increased. The mutational specificities of N-nitroso-N-methylurea and N-nitrosopyrrolidine were significantly different from the specificity of E"

        "abstract": "Hand trajectory, tangential velocity and acceleration, time and distance until peak velocity and reaction time were analyzed during the process of learning a skilled, visually-guided arm movement. Primates were trained to move a cursor with a manipulandum from a start box to target boxes displayed on a horizontal video screen during control conditions and when the relationship (gain) between the cursor and manipulandum was altered. The animals adapted to the altered feedback over 100-200 trials. A subsequent testing phase with randomly interspersed trials using the control gain demonstrated that the animals had modified their movements appropriately for the novel gain. Examination of the kinematics revealed that in adapting to a novel gain, primates scaled movement amplitude, tangential velocity, acceleration, and duration appropriately for the distance the hand needed to travel. Yet time to peak velocity was kept constant. Reaction time also remained unchanged for three of the four animals. Movements were performed in two phases, the first from movement onset to peak velocity and the second from peak velocity until the end of the movement. During the first phase the shape of the trajectory and velocity profile were stereotypic and without evidence of any corrections, consistent with this phase being essentially open loop. However, corrections occurred in the second phase and we propose visual feedback was used to correct for the difference in hand/cursor position. Learning appeared to involve utilizing the errors from previous trials to modify the early feedforward phase of subsequent trials. Peak tangential velocity, total movement duration and distance reached at peak tangential velocity all scaled linearly with the total movement distance required at each gain. Based on regression analyses, for none of these variables were the changes in learning completely adequate to compensate for total distance required. However, distance to peak velocity scaled with peak velocity in relation to the control gain. The results show that non-human primates adopt a consistent strategy when learning to scale a multi-joint movement. The metrics of the movement scaled yet the time to peak velocity remained constant, suggesting independent control of time and amplitude. Keeping time to peak velocity constant as well as the scaling of peak velocity with distance to peak velocity are viewed as ways to simplify the learning process."

        "abstract": "Voltage-dependent calcium influx has been shown to regulate the differentiation of cultured amphibian spinal neurons. We have examined the transient elevation of intracellular calcium induced by depolarization, using calcium indicators and confocal microscopy with high temporal and spatial resolution. Rapid calcium elevations in both the nucleus and the cytosol are primarily due to calcium-dependent release of calcium from intracellular stores. Depletion of stores associated with the endoplasmic reticulum reduces all transients. Elevations diminish with neuronal maturation. Depletion of stores of intracellular calcium at early times affects neuronal differentiation in a manner similar to the prevention of influx. The results indicate that both influx and release are necessary to promote neuronal differentiation."

        "abstract": "DMN exposure has been shown to increase macrophage cytotoxic activity against tumor targets both in vitro and in vivo. Since the production and expression of the macrophage-derived cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is associated with such anti-tumor activity, studies were performed to determine whether changes in TNF-alpha gene transcription and biosynthesis resulted following DMN exposure. Thioglycollate-elicited macrophages obtained from DMN-exposed animals displayed enhanced levels of constitutively expressed TNF-alpha transcripts compared to vehicle controls. Northern blot analysis of the time course expression of TNF-alpha following endotoxin (1 microgram/ml) stimulation in vitro showed a significantly greater induction of TNF-alpha transcripts in macrophages from DMN-exposed than control animals, with peak levels detected between 30 and 120 min. Maximum endotoxin-induced TNF-alpha secretion occurred later than the accumulation of the transcripts, with greater secretion observed between 120 and 360 min. In contrast to endotoxin, stimulation with IFN-gamma (100 U/ml) produced no changes in the level of TNF-alpha transcripts. However, stimulation of macrophages with IFN-gamma did greatly enhance the surface expression of membrane-bound TNF-alpha in cells from the DMN-treated animals. Supernatants from media and endotoxin stimulated macrophage were tested for TNF-alpha activity against WEHI-164 cells. In media alone, a five-fold increase in TNF-alpha activity was observed at 6 h in supernatants from macrophage obtained from DMN-exposed animals compared to the vehicle group. Treatment of supernatants with either superoxide dismutase (SOD) or catalase to remove reactive oxygen products did not alter their lytic capacity. However, addition of a neutralizing murine-anti-TNF-alpha antibody reduced the lytic capacity of the supernatants by 90% in both treatment groups. Accumulation of IL-1 beta transcripts gradually increased over the 6 h with a concomitant increase in secreted IL-1 beta that was identical in both DMN and vehicle groups. These results demonstrate that DMN exposure: (1) enhances the expression of TNF-alpha in peripheral macrophages by transcriptional regulatory mechanism(s) and, (2) does not alter the expression or secretion of IL-1 beta."

Since melittin is also known to react with lipids to induce a breakdown of vesicular structure, the observed denaturation of water-soluble proteins of a human lens that developed a cataract due to multiple bee stings may be accounted for by the effects of melittin to some extent. The melittin-induced decrease of conformational order, as observed in our in-vitro studies could thus be of physiological significance."

        "abstract": "Receptor-mediated cell adhesion phenomena play a vital role in many physiological and biotechnology-related processes. To investigate the physical and chemical factors that influence the cell/surface interaction, we have used a radial flow device, a so-called Radial-Flow Detachment Assay (RFDA). The RFDA allows us to make direct observations of the detachment process under specified experimental conditions. In results reported here, we have studied the detachment of receptor-coated latex beads (prototype cells) from ligand-coated glass surfaces. The receptors and ligands used in this work are complementary antibodies. The beads enable us to examine several aspects of the adhesion process with particles having uniform properties that can be varied systematically. Advantages of the RFDA are many, especially direct observation of cell detachment over a range of shear stresses with quantitative measurement of the adhesive force. We focus our studies on the effects of ligand and receptor densities, along with the influence of pH and ionic strength of the medium. These data are analyzed with a mathematical model based on the theoretical framework of Bell, G. I. (1978. Science [Wash. DC]. 200:618-627) and Hammer, D. A. and D. A. Lauffenburger (1987. Biophys. J. 52:475-487). We demonstrate experimental validation of a theoretical expression for the critical shear stress for particle detachment, and show that it is consistent with reasonable estimates for the receptor-ligand bond affinity."

        "article_title": "Mechanical and metabolic determinants of myocardial stunning in extracorporeally perfused pig hearts.",
        "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to apply step-wise multiple linear regression analysis retrospectively to an array of mechanical and metabolic measurements chosen because they had the potential to predict the extent of contractile recovery from a prescribed duration of myocardial ischemia. Data were acquired from the extracorporeally perfused, intact, working pig heart which was rendered regionally ischemic (60% reduction in anterior descending coronary flow) for 45 minutes and reperfused to aerobic levels for a final 30-50 minutes. Mechanical recovery was defined by the percentage systolic shortening and the area circumscribed by left ventricular pressure-segment length loops. Data were taken from 39 control hearts and from 16 hearts treated with oxfenicine, an agent which we have previously used to alter mechanical function by its interference with fatty acid metabolism. Despite the fixed nature of the protocol in affecting ischemic hypoperfusion, a wide range of mechanical responses encompassing hypo- and dyskinesis was produced during ischemia, followed by mechanical stunning during reflow. Of the parameters surveyed, regional indices of mechanical performance, together with perfusate pH and PCO2, best predicted recovery. Along with the heart rate, these predictors gave correlations of 0.875 for percentage systolic shortening and 0.766 for the length-pressure loop in control hearts. The analyses were also sensitive to the influence of pharmacological intervention with oxfenicine in that several parameters lost statistical significance for percentage systolic shortening and two were added (heart rate and end-diastolic length) for the length-pressure loop. Separate statistical models for oxfenicine-treated hearts gave correlations of 0.905 for percentage systolic shortening and 0.915 for the length-pressure loop. The data suggest that step-wise multiple linear regression analysis provides new insights toward our understanding of the mechanisms of mechanical stunning in myocardial reperfusion."

        "abstract": "We investigated the tubular action of endothelin in rat nephron segments. The effects of endothelin on arginine vasopressin (AVP)-, parathyroid hormone-, glucagon-, calcitonin-, and isoproterenol-dependent cAMP accumulation were studied. The following nephron segments were microdissected: glomerulus (Gl), proximal convoluted tubule (PCT), cortical and medullary thick ascending limbs of Henle's loop (cTAL and mTAL, respectively), cortical collecting duct (CCD), outer medullary collecting duct (OMCD), and inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD). Endothelin dose dependently (10(-8)-10(-10)M) inhibited AVP-dependent cAMP accumulation in CCD, OMCD, and IMCD. This effect was independent of the presence or absence of phosphodiesterase inhibitor, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, Ca channel blocker nicardipine, or indomethacin, but was abolished in the presence of protein kinase C inhibitor H-7. Protein kinase C stimulator dioctanoyl glycerol mimicked the effect of endothelin. On the other hand, endothelin had no inhibitory effect on AVP-dependent cAMP accumulation in cTAL or mTAL, parathyroid hormone-dependent cAMP accumulation in Gl and PCT, or glucagon-, calcitonin-, and isoprotereol-dependent cAMP accumulation in OMCD. We conclude that endothelin specifically inhibits AVP-dependent cAMP accumulation in CCD, OMCD, and IMCD through activating protein kinase C. This effect possibly has a role in maintaining urine volume to counteract the decrease in GFR caused by endothelin itself."

We hypothesized that perfusion to collapsed areas would similarly increase when PVDP was increased by a circulating pulmonary vasoconstrictor. Group B streptococci (GBS) were infused into 10 young piglets with left lung atelectasis to produce pulmonary vasoconstriction and determine if perfusion to collapsed regions (QL/QT) and intrapulmonary QS/QT increased as pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) increased. Left lung collapse alone increased PVR from 11 +/- 3 to 18 +/- 10 mm Hg/L/min and QS/QT from 1.9 +/- 1.4% to 8.3 +/- 6.4%; QL/QT decreased from 44 +/- 1% to 10 +/- 7% of total pulmonary blood flow (p less than 0.02). Intravenous GBS increased PVDP from 11 +/- 3 to 27 +/- 4 mm Hg and further increased PVR from 18 +/- 10 to 33 +/- 12 mm Hg/L/min (p less than 0.02) but did not change cardiac output, QS/QT, or QL/QT. Changes in QL/QT and QS/QT are not predicted by changes in PVDP alone but also depend upon the site and nature of pulmonary vasoconstriction in infants with regional lung disease."

The aim of the present study is twofold: 1) to define the frequency of peptic ulcer in chronic liver disease in a large sample of cirrhotic patients, 2) to investigate the epidemiological and clinical features of a group of subjects affected by both peptic ulcer and liver cirrhosis. Two years of admission have been retrospectively investigated to define the frequency of peptic ulcer in chronic liver disease. In 237 subjects affected by both cirrhosis and peptic ulcer, epidemiological and clinical data were collected. Peptic ulcer was present in 16% of cirrhotic patients. There were no differences between ulcer subjects who drank and those did not. A linear positive correlation between smoking habit and frequency of ulcer disease has been found in the words. A positive history for peptic ulcer was described in a little subgroup of the studied sample, suggesting a low importance of the genetic factor in the pathophysiological pattern of ulcer disease in chronic hepatitis."

We evaluated 26 patients who had undergone bilateral orchiectomy for prostatic carcinoma to determine the incidence of vasomotor symptoms and the efficacy of low-dose diethylstilbestrol (DES) in the treatment of those symptoms. Measurements of serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and testosterone were performed to look for endocrine patterns which may be related to the presence of vasomotor symptoms. Fourteen patients (54%) reported the presence of vasomotor symptoms beginning one to four weeks after surgery. These patients were treated with DES or placebo in a double-blind crossover trial. The frequency and severity of hot flushes were significantly reduced during the time DES was given. This was accomplished with a low dose of 1 mg daily of DES which avoids the cardiovascular complications of higher doses. We found no correlation between the presence, severity, or frequency of hot flushes and serum gonadotropin or testosterone concentrations."

        "abstract": "The fifth group-I intron in the chloroplast large subunit rRNA-encoding gene of Chlamydomonas eugametos (CeLSU.5) is mobile during interspecific crosses between C. eugametos and Chlamydomonas moewusii. Like the six other mobile introns that have been well characterized so far, CeLSU.5 contains a long open reading frame (ceuIR) coding for a site-specific endonuclease (I-CeuI) that cleaves the C. moewusii intronless gene in the vicinity of the intron-insertion site. This stimulates gap repair and mediates efficient transfer of the intron at its cognate site. By expressing the ceuIR gene in the Escherichia coli vectors pKK233-2 and pTRC-99A, we recently demonstrated that the endonuclease is highly toxic to E. coli [Gauthier et al., Curr. Genet. 19 (1991) 43-47]. To eliminate this problem and characterize the cleavage pattern and recognition sequence of the I-CeuI endonuclease, we have expressed the ceuIR gene in E. coli under the control of a bacteriophage T7 promoter in a tightly regulated M13 system, and developed an in vitro system to assay partially purified I-CeuI activity. This allowed us to determine that I-CeuI recognizes a sequence of less than 26 bp centered around the insertion site and produces a staggered cut 5 bp downstream from this site, yielding 4-nucleotide (CTAA), 3'-OH overhangs."

        "abstract": "Recurrent aliphatic hydrophobic amino acids which occur in the sequence of a protein or a peptide at positions which form an axial, hydrophobic strip when the sequence is coiled as an alpha helix might stabilize coiling against hydrophobic surfaces. That effect can lead to helix formation against hydrophobic cores of nascent proteins or excised T cell-presented peptides and to protease protection and scavenging for presentation by MHC molecules. Such consensus sequences of recurrent hydrophobicity creating a scavenger \"S\" site might overlap to varying degrees the T cell-presented \"T\" epitope which actually sits in the antigen-binding site of a MHC molecules, as long as a cleavage \"C\" site does not fall between them when they are relatively separated. Cooperatively among the residues in an axial, hydrophobic strip to stabilize helix formation is reflected in the SOHHI, which is the mean hydrophobicity of residues in such potential strips. Algorithms based on the SOHHI, with additional considerations related to length and caps, lead to sensitive and efficient predictions of structural helices and of T cell-presented epitopes. In experimental tests of these ideas, the SOHHI was found to correlate to helical coiling of amphiphilic peptides in the presence of lipid vesicles. These principles lead to hypotheses to alter the potency and range of MHC restriction of peptide vaccines or to decrease the immunogenicity of therapeutic proteins."

Patients were drug-free except for benzodiazepines. Amplitudes and amplitude/stimulus intensity slopes were adjusted to same sex, age, height, and weight. Uni-and multivariate correlations revealed associations between the N140-P200 amplitude and hypothyroidlike aspects of depression with symptoms such as poor appetite and indecisiveness, and between the P100-N140 slope and intrapunitive aspects of depression with symptoms such as negative self-evaluation and suicidal attempts.

        "abstract": "Although regional lymph node lymphocytes (LNL) are thought to be a barrier of the immunological surveillance, their natural cytotoxicity is strongly suppressed. In this study, an immunopotentiator OK-432 (10K.E.) was injected into gastric cancer lesions under endoscopy 1 week before operation, and the effects on the cytotoxicity of LNL were examined by single cell assay. This assay is characterized by assessment of killer cell frequency in preventing the killer cells from recycling by their fixation in agarose, and by direct microscopic observation of both binding and killing phases. NK sensitive cell line K562 was used as target cells. By intratumoral injection of OK-432, the killer cell frequency of LNL in 8 out of 20 cases was elevated to almost equal level as that of peripheral blood lymphocytes. In clinical stages these 8 cases belonged to early stages (stage I 7 cases, stage II 1 case). In LNL subsets of OK-432 injected cases, the percentage of OKT8 positive cells was decreased and the ratio of OKT4 and OKT8 was significantly increased compared with non-injected group."

        "abstract": "PhoE protein of Escherichia coli K12 is an outer membrane protein which is supposed to span the membrane sixteen times. By creating a deletion which removes the last membrane-spanning fragment and studying the localization of the truncated PhoE, we show that this fragment is indispensable for trimerization and outer membrane localization. In addition, circumstantial evidence for the proposed topology model of the protein was obtained. An insertion mutation in a region supposed to be cell surface-exposed, interferes with the binding of a monoclonal antibody which recognizes a cell surface-exposed epitope of the protein."

Numerous etiological factors such as ischaemia, chronic infection, neurological and recently immunological factors have been connected with the disease as its possible causes. The incidence of the disease is regularly underestimated or overestimated. Sixty-one patients with chronic relapsing cystitis have been evaluated. The parameters which could help in promptly establishing a reliable diagnosis are pointed out in this paper."

        "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to quantitatively estimate the relative contribution of arteriolar rarefaction (disappearance of microvessels) and arteriolar constriction to the increases in total peripheral resistance and changes in the patterns of flow distribution observed in hypertension. A mathematical model of the hamster cheek pouch intraluminal microcirculation was constructed based on data from the literature and observations from our own laboratory. Separate rarefaction and constriction of third-order (3A) and fourth-order (4A) arterioles were performed on the model, and the results were quantified based on the changes of the computed vascular resistance. The degree of increase in resistance depended both on the number and the order of vessels rarefied or constricted and also on the position of those vessels in the network. The maximum increases in resistance obtained in the model runs were 21% for rarefaction and 75% for constriction. Rarefaction, but not constriction, produced large increases in the degree of heterogeneity of blood flow in the various vessel orders. These results demonstrate that vessel rarefaction significantly influences tissue blood flow resistance to a degree comparable with vessel constriction; however, unlike constriction, microvascular rarefaction markedly altered blood flow distribution in our model of the hamster cheek pouch vascular bed. These findings conform with the hypothesis that a significant component of the increase in total peripheral resistance in hypertension may be due to vessel rarefaction."

This overcame the problem of further handling of the fragile discs. Dissolution media employed were similar to those used for the routine evaluation of lithium carbonate dosage forms. Linear dissolution rate profiles were found in simulated gastric fluid (SGF), Tris buffer and water. Data in SGF and water showed positive intercepts with the Levich model. The dissolution process of lithium carbonate was considered to be complex. Dissolution profiles in simulated intestinal fluid (SIF) containing phosphate showed a marked initial curvature and a subsequent reduced dissolution rate. This was due to the precipitation of trilithium phosphate onto the disc. Dissolution rate studies on lithium carbonate dosage forms could be invalidated where a phosphate buffer system has been used."

        "abstract": "We have measured gating currents from the squid giant axon using solutions that preserve functional K channels and with experimental conditions that minimize Na channel contributions to these currents. Two pharmacological agents were used to identify a component of gating current that is associated with K channels. Low concentrations of internal Zn2+ that considerably slow K channel ionic currents with no effect on Na channel currents altered the component of gating current associated with K channels. At low concentrations (10-50 microM) the small, organic, dipolar molecule phloretin has several reported specific effects on K channels: it reduces K channel conductance, shifts the relationship between channel conductance and membrane voltage (Vm) to more positive potentials, and reduces the voltage dependence of the conductance-Vm relation. The K channel gating charge movements were altered in an analogous manner by 10 microM phloretin. We also measured the dominant time constants of the K channel ionic and gating currents. These time constants were similar over part of the accessible voltage range, but at potentials between -40 and 0 mV the gating current time constants were two to three times faster than the corresponding ionic current values. These features of K channel function can be reproduced by a simple kinetic model in which the channel is considered to consist of two, two-state, nonidentical subunits."

        "abstract": "Radioiodination of highly purified human follicle-stimulating hormone (hFSH) (4000 IU/mg) was performed every other week for 23 weeks using 2 mCI carrier free Na125I (Amersham Corp., 15 mCi/micrograms I2) in the presence of lactoperoxidase. Incorporation of 125I into hFSH was determined by the method of R. C. Greenwood, W. M. Hunter, and J. S. Grover (1963) Biochem. J. 89, 114). Hormone binding was studied in vitro under steady-state conditions (16 h, 20 degrees C) using different calf testis membrane preparations having similar receptor characteristics. Each 125I-hFSH preparation was characterized for maximum bindability, specific activity of bindable radioligand as determined by self-displacement analysis, and by determination of Ka and Rt. Incorporation of 125I into FSH was relatively constant over the large number of experiments (62.4 +/- 6.4 microCi/micrograms; n = 23). By comparison, however, specific radioactivity of the receptor bindable fraction of 125I-hFSH was related to the lot of 125I utilized, and was significantly (P less than or equal to 0.01) lower and more variable (28.7 +/- 10.5 microCi/micrograms). Maximum bindability of 125I-hFSH was not correlated to specific activity (r = 0.06) but was negatively correlated to hFSH 125I incorporation (r = -0.47; P less than or equal to 0.05). These observations demonstrate the need to assess the quality of each batch of radioligand before undertaking radioligand-receptor assays and suggest that differences in Na125I lots affect specific radioactivity of the radioligand and its receptor binding characteristics."

The results show a wide variation in potency for the individual units, an increase in release rate with increasing pH, and an increase in release rate if the pellets are crushed. The wide variation in potency explains the variation found in absolute bioavailability, and the increase in release rate when the pellets are crushed explains the differences seen in peak plasma times, since the pellets will be chewed to varying degrees by the horse."

        "abstract": "Surgical indications for patients with ischemic heart disease are discussed from a physician's viewpoint. Among the subsets of this disease, surgical treatment is undoubtedly recommended for patients with serious complications following acute myocardial infarction (MI) such as cardiac rupture, interventricular septal perforation, acute severe mitral regurgitation and left ventricular mural thrombi complicated by systemic emboli, because these subsets have little or no response to medical treatment. Patients with left ventricular aneurysm are also surgical candidates, if they have refractory left heart failure or ventricular arrhythmias. Indications for coronary artery bypass surgery (CABS) for patients with angina pectoris are as yet controversial in Japan among physicians and surgeons, because the Japanese comply well with medications, and medically-treated patients have favorable prognoses. Indication standards for CABS may consist of three components; the first, an essential condition of the institution where CABS is performed. It includes the physician's ability to precisely diagnose angina pectoris, availability of skilled surgeons and anesthesiologists for heart surgery, a well-organized system for patient management during and after CABS and an acceptable success rate. The second includes a clinical indication. It is considered valid that candidates for CABS should be basically patients unresponsive to medical treatment, in so far as there would be a risk such as perioperative MI or operative death. Angina pectoris is judged to be medically-resistant when chest pain at rest does not resolve, or an exercise capacity necessary for patients' social rehabilitation is not achievable, after the appropriate administration of antianginal agents including a combination of nitrates, calcium antagonists and beta-blockers. The last problem is an anatomical indication. Recent advances in percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), an effective therapeutic procedure for coronary revascularization, has greatly influenced indications for CABS, and it makes it difficult to strictly distinguish medical from surgical treatment. The purpose, clinical indications, and efficacy of PTCA are similar to those of CABS. However, patients' physical, emotional and socioeconomic burdens relative to PTCA are remarkably less than those of CABS. Thus, it seems reasonable that CABS should be recommended to patients who have contraindications to or high risks with PTCA, such as left main trunk lesions; whereas in general, there are no anatomical contraindications to CABS."

        "abstract": "Infection is frequent in all stages and forms of asthma. It is a source of exacerbations of all degrees of severity. Bacterial infection, especially with commensal organisms from the upper respiratory tract, may cause bronchial hyperreactivity (HRB) by various mechanisms, specific--microbial delayed hypersensitivity, probably rate; IgE-dependent hypersensitivity others non-specific: bronchial inflammation, source of mediators of bronchial constriction; activation of complement, direct histamine liberation; beta blockage...; or mixed mechanisms. Respiratory viral infection probably plays the most important role in the natural history of asthmatic disease, especially in infants and young children by inducing or amplifying HRB and creating a transitory obstructive syndrome of the small airways. This virus-induced HRB may develop into a respiratory syncytial virus viraemia at first or remain latent found by tests of bronchial activity. The pathogenic mechanisms of this HRB are often multi-factorial and interlinked: they are chiefly linked to the various cytopathic effects of the virus on the respiratory epithelium, to the viral inflammation; but also to disturbance of the equilibrium of the autonomous nervous system (beta blockage, excitation of the cholinergic receptors); finally in some areas, to virus-induced amplification of the local and systemic immune responses by IgE that favours clinical consideration of atopy."

        "abstract": "Recent studies have been reviewed to establish the possible importance of the interaction between Helicobacter pylori infection and gastric acid secretion. H. pylori infection results in increased gastrin release, but this does not lead to gastric acid hypersecretion and gastrin normalizes after eradication of the infection. An optimal, well-tolerated treatment strategy against H. pylori infection has not yet been clearly defined. One potentially useful approach may be to improve the antibacterial efficacy of antibiotics by effectively regulating gastric acidity. H2-receptor antagonists have no effect against H. pylori infection, while omeprazole (an acid pump inhibitor) appears to have a bacteriostatic action. Combination therapy with omeprazole and amoxycillin has been found to eradicate H. pylori in 50-80% of patients with duodenal ulcer, leading to a significant reduction in ulcer recurrence."

        "abstract": "The relationship between nasal anatomy and olfactory ability was evaluated by correlating measurements from nasal cavity CT scans with the results of an established clinical measure of olfactory function (Odorant Confusion Matrix, or OCM). The most appropriate mathematical model of this relationship was developed by analyzing the logarithms of 30 anatomical measures and a logistic transform of the OCM percent correct score. Two nasal cavity regions were found to be the most important factors in accounting for the olfactory test results, with a third region modifying the effects of the first two. The results of this study suggest that nasal anatomy may play a role in controlling the access of an odorant to the olfactory receptor area. The conclusions of this study have implications for nasal surgeons who, when possible, should make attempts to repair or preserve these nasal regions which seem to be so important to olfactory function."

An attempt is also made to relate the formation of these reactive intermediates to biochemical and pharmacological basis for tumor cell kill and resistance. The formation of these intermediates in some tumor cells has been detected by both direct ESR and spin-trapping technique. The detection of free radicals in biological systems, however, depends upon cellular bioenvironments, e.g. reducing conditions, and the presence and/or absence of activation and detoxification mechanisms. Evidence shows that certain antitumor drugs generate free radicals in vitro and in vivo and that these reactive species kill tumor cells by causing damage to DNA, membranes or enzymes."

        "abstract": "The presence within the epithelioid granulomas of sarcoidosis of lymphocytes of the \"helper\" (T4 positive) phenotype suggests that, as in granulomatous diseases of known aetiology, active cell mediated immunity plays a part in the disease. It has, however, been noted that T8 positive lymphocytes are also found on occasion in the granulomas. The presence of cells bearing markers associated with suppressor activity in various lesions of sarcoidosis has been investigated with a range of monoclonal antibodies. T4 positive cells were present in all granulomas; T8 positive lymphocytes were present within the epithelioid cell areas in proportions that varied from 5 to 55/100 of T4 cells. Other lymphocyte markers associated with suppression (Leu8 and SN130) were very rare on lymphocytes within granulomas but common on both T4 positive and T8 positive lymphocytes in the perigranulomatous mantle, which suggests that expression of these markers was down regulated in the granuloma or that cells bearing them are unable to migrate into the granuloma. Nevertheless, suppressor cell mechanisms could mediate the spontaneous resolution of most cases of sarcoidosis, and the presence or absence of cells bearing suppression associated phenotypes in the granuloma or its mantle may have prognostic importance."

        "abstract": "Effects of fiber vs starch energy supplements on endogenous growth hormone (GH), insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) and animal performance from weaning to breeding age were evaluated in 18, 9-mo-old beef heifers. Heifers had ad libitum access to wheat silage plus an average daily supplement intake of 1) 4.08 kg corn-soybean meal (SBM) (high energy-starch, HS), 2) 4.54 kg soyhulls (SH)-SBM (high energy-fiber, HF) or 3) 1.36 kg SH-SBM (low energy-fiber, LE). Serum samples were collected via jugular puncture every 10 d and were analyzed for IGF-1 by RIA. On d 45 and d 176, four heifers per treatment were fasted 18 h and serial blood samples collected via jugular cannulas every 15 min for 6.5 h. Arginine (.5 g/kg BW) was administered intravenously (ARG) to induce release of GH, and four additional samples of blood were collected. Samples were analyzed by RIA for GH. Mean fasted GH (6.4 +/- .4, 8.3 +/- .4 and 13.8 +/- .4 ng/ml for HS, HF and LE, respectively) varied with energy source and level (P less than .01). Mean GH following ARG was higher (P less than .01) in heifers receiving LE (46.2 +/- 4.7) than in those receiving HS and HF (23.5 +/- 4.4 and 24.1 +/- 4.6 ng/ml). Basal GH concentration and peak amplitude were higher (P less than .05) in LE than in HS and HF treatments. Diet did not influence number or frequency of GH peaks.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

        "abstract": "The volume of gas delivered from a high-frequency ventilation (HFV) circuit was measured with an ultrasonic flowmeter. The measurements were done in vitro (20-liter air-filled glass bottle) and in vivo (9 anesthetized dogs lying supine) at oscillation frequencies ranging from 4 to 23 Hz and stroke volumes of the pump ranging from 36 to 150 ml. We varied the length and diameter of the tube connecting the pump with the endotracheal tube, the length and diameter of the bias outflow tube, the diameter of the endotracheal tube, and the stroke volume of the pump. Both in vitro and in vivo, there was resonant amplification of the delivered gas volume; i.e., the delivered gas volume exceeded the stroke volume at certain frequencies. Altering the dimensions of connecting tube, endotracheal tube, bias outflow tube, or stroke volume, i.e., changing the resistance to gas flow, gas compliance, and/or gas inertance in these elements, altered the ratio of gas delivered to stroke volume that could be predicted by an electric analog. These data indicate that the delivered gas volume during HFV depends critically on the configuration of the HFV circuit, the size of the endotracheal tube, the oscillation frequency, and the pump stroke volume. Knowledge of the delivered gas volume during HFV and appreciation of the phenomenon of resonant amplification of the delivered gas volume will permit a more accurate description of factors contributing to gas transport during HFV."

        "abstract": "Estrogen increases the ability of the estrogen-dependent MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line to both proliferate and invade through an artificial basement membrane. In studying the response of MCF-7 cells to various antiestrogens, we found that 4-hydroxytamoxifen and tamoxifen inhibited cell proliferation but increased their invasiveness. In contrast, the structurally unrelated benzothiophene antiestrogens, LY117018 and LY156758, were potent antiproliferative agents which did not stimulate invasiveness. The differential effects of these antiestrogenic agents on invasion correlated with changes in production of collagenase IV, while no significant change was seen in the chemotactic activity of the cells. Invasiveness was increased by 17 beta-estradiol or 4-hydroxytamoxifen after a few hours of treatment and was rapidly lost when 17 beta-estradiol was withdrawn. Stimulation of invasiveness with 17 beta-estradiol was blocked by the antiestrogen, LY117018. Cells from the MDA-MB-231 line which lacks estrogen receptors were not affected by estrogen or antiestrogen in terms of proliferation or invasion. These studies indicate that the invasiveness of MCF-7 cells is regulated by antiestrogens through the estrogen receptor and may be mediated by collagenase IV activity. Antiestrogens which reduce both the proliferation and invasiveness of these cells may be interesting new candidates for clinical application."

        "abstract": "During the enzymatic cycle of the cytochromes P450, dioxygen binds to the ferrous haemprotein when the resting ferric haemprotein has undergone a one-electron oxidation after substrate binding. A further one-electron reduction generates an intermediate that is isoelectronic with a peroxide dianion coordinated to a ferric iron. Heterolytic cleavage of the omicron--omicron bond generates water and a species which is formally an oxene (oxygen atom) coordinated by iron(III). However, on the basis of model reactions and by analogy to the catalases and peroxidases, this active oxidizing intermediate is formulated as an oxo-FeIV porphyrin pi-cation radical. The radical is stabilized by delocalization on the porphyrin macrocycle and the high oxidation state is achieved by oxidizing both the metal and the porphyrin ring of the haemprotein. Hydrogen atom abstraction from a saturated hydrocarbon substrate generates a substrate free radical, constrained by the protein binding site, and the equivalent of a hydroxyl radical bound to iron(III). Coupling of the 'hydroxy' and substrate radicals generates hydroxylated product and resting protein. For olefins an initial electron transfer to oxidized haemprotein gives a substrate cation radical. Further reaction of this radical can give the epoxide, the principal product; an aldehyde or ketone by rearrangement; or an alkylated haemprotein resulting in suicide inhibition."

At each visit colposcopy was performed and multiple sites sampled for HSV. During the study four women had no recurrence of HSV infection, but four had at least one positive viral culture. One of these patients was asymptomatically shedding HSV on nine of her 11 clinic visits. Two episodes of urethral shedding were detected. In this group of patients the presence of inguinal lymphadenopathy was appreciably associated with the isolation of HSV from the urogenital tract."

        "abstract": "Giardia cysts isolated from humans, beavers, mice, and muskrats were tested in cross-species transmission experiments for their ability to infect either beavers or muskrats. Giardia cysts, derived from multiple symptomatic human donors and used for inoculation of beavers or muskrats, were shown to be viable by incorporation of fluorogenic dyes, excystation, and their ability to produce infections in the Mongolian gerbil model. Inoculation of beavers with 5 x 10(5) Giardia lamblia cysts resulted in the infection of 75% of the animals (n = 8), as judged by the presence of fecal cysts or intestinal trophozoites at necropsy. The mean prepatent period was 13.1 days. An infective dose experiment, using 5 x 10(1) to 5 x 10(5) viable G. lamblia cysts collected by fluorescence-activated cell sorting, demonstrated that doses of between, less than 50, and less than 500 viable cysts were required to produce infection in beavers. Scanning electron microscopy of beaver small intestine revealed that attachment of G. lamblia trophozoites produced lesions in the microvillous border. Inoculation of muskrats with G. lamblia cysts produced infections when the dose of cysts was equal to or greater than 1.25 x 10(5). The inoculation of beavers with Giardia ondatrae or Giardia muris cysts did not produce any infection; however, the administration to muskrats of Giardia cysts of beaver origin resulted in the infection of 62% of the animals (n = 8), with a prepatent period of 5 days. Our results demonstrated that beavers and muskrats could be infected with Giardia cysts derived from humans, but only by using large numbers of cysts.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

        "abstract": "In order to provide a means for analysis of heat, water, and soluble gas exchange with the airways during tidal ventilation, a one dimensional theoretical model describing heat and water exchange in the respiratory airways has been extended to include soluble gas exchange with the airway mucosa and water exchange with the mucous layer lining the airways. Not only do heat, water, and gas exchange occur simultaneously, but they also interact. Heating and cooling of the airway surface and mucous lining affects both evaporative water and soluble gas exchange. Water evaporation provides a major source of heat exchange. The model-predicted mean airway temperature profiles agree well with literature data for both oral and nasal breathing validating that part of the model. With model parameters giving the best fit to experimental data, the model shows: (a) substantial heat recovery in the upper airways, (b) minimal respiratory heat and water loss, and (c) low average mucous temperatures and maximal increases in mucous thickness. For resting breathing of room air, heat and water conservation appear to be more important than conditioning efficiency. End-tidal expired partial pressures of very soluble gases eliminated by the lungs are predicted to be lower than the alveolar partial pressures due to the absorption of the expired gases by the airway mucosa. The model may be usable for design of experiments to examine mechanisms associated with the local hydration and dehydration dynamics of the mucosal surface, control of bronchial perfusion, triggering of asthma, mucociliary clearance and deposition of inhaled pollutant gases."

This alcohol-induced cortical hypervascularization, resembling closely the enhanced cortical vascular network observed in chronologically aged rats as well as around a lesion-induced cavity performed on the cortex, was significantly reduced by a concomitant treatment with Sabeluzole, a chemically benzothiazol derivative with antihypoxic and antiischaemic properties. The blood alcohol level of rats treated with the antihypoxic agent remained stable and constant at a mean level of 1 g/l during a whole 2-week-alcoholization duration in contrast to that of untreated rats which was directly related to the increased alcohol concentration of the atmosphere insufflated in the alcoholization chamber. Finally, a free-choice paradigm achieved after the chronic intoxication also revealed that Sabeluzole-treated rats chose to drink less alcohol as compared to untreated rats suggesting Sabeluzole well modulated the alcohol-induced behavioral preference."

The tense swollen appearance of the shoulder has caused concern that the intramuscular deltoid pressure may become elevated to dangerous levels. Therefore, the intramuscular deltoid pressure was monitored in this study using a slit catheter. Although it was found that the intramuscular pressure became transiently elevated during the arthroscopic procedures, in every case the pressures promptly returned to normal levels within 30 min postoperatively. The clinical swelling and tenseness remained for a longer period. Despite a sometimes alarming amount of swelling during shoulder arthroscopy, intramuscular pressure elevations were only sustained for a short time and returned to normal levels very quickly after the cessation of fluid infusion."

The prevalence of pregnancy in patients referred on account of invasive cancer of the uterine cervix savings between 0.7% and 3.5%, but despite the extensive cytological screening of fertile women, no decrease has been observed. The average patient is 31.5 years, 3.7 gravida and 3.0 para. The five-year survival for the disease in stage I b is found to be 70% and thus now appears to be poorer than in non-pregnant women. On this background and as 39% were asymptomatic, routine smear examination is recommended at the first antenatal examination. If deviations in the cell pattern are found, meticulous follow-up must be performed with colposcopy and biopsy specimens so that the question of invasive growth can be elucidated as early as possible during pregnancy and, when this is present, adequate treatment must be instituted."

        "abstract": "N-Benzyladriamycin-14-valerate (AD 198) is a new lipophilic adriamycin (ADR) analogue that shows marked therapeutic superiority to ADR in murine tumor model systems yet differs mechanistically from ADR in a number of ways. Among its other properties, AD 198 produces a delayed but profound effect on cell-cycle progression and a pattern of continuing DNA damage in cultured cells briefly exposed to the drug. Using radiolabeled drug forms and radioassays combined with HPLC separation and fluorimetric detection techniques, aspects of drug accumulation, biotransformation, and retention in cultured human CEM leukemic lymphocytes were studied, in part to determine a possible pharmacologic basis for the latent effects seen with this drug. In addition, the cellular pharmacology of AD 198 and ADR were comparatively examined under identical experimental conditions. When CEM cells were incubated with drug at equi-growth inhibitory/minimally cytotoxic concentrations (AD 198, 1.0 microM; ADR, 0.1 microM), a number of differences were apparent. Under conditions of continuous 24-h drug exposure, a slow cellular accumulation and equilibration was observed with ADR (cell: medium equilibrium, 1:11 after 4-6 h), whereas the uptake of AD 198 was rapid and extensive (cell: medium equilibrium, 3:1 within 30 min). In drug-retention studies, when cells were pretreated at the same drug concentrations as before (AD 198 for 1 h; ADR for 4 h) and then transferred to drug-free media, both compounds re-equilibrated their intracellular drug content with the fresh media, losing about 50% of their respective anthracycline levels. Liquid chromatographic analysis of ADR-treated cultures under both sets of conditions showed the parent drug to be the only intracellular anthracycline species, whereas analysis of AD 198-treated cultures revealed two fluorescent signals corresponding to the parent drug and its 14-de-esterified biotransformation product, N-benzyladriamycin (AD 288). Levels of AD 288 rose from 2% of the total intracellular anthracycline content immediately on drug admixture to 61% following 24 h continuous drug exposure and to 69% at 24 h in cells exposed to drug for 1 h and then continued in drug-free media for 24 h. At all times, the balance of the intracellular anthracycline fluorescence was attributable to the parent drug; no ADR was detectable in AD 198-treated cells by either fluorescence detection or radioassay.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

        "article_title": "Evidence that Crotalus durissus terrificus (South American rattlesnake) envenomation in humans causes myolysis rather than hemolysis.",
        "abstract": "The venom of the South American rattlesnake Crotalus durissus terrificus was originally reported to have a pathophysiological activity mainly involving hemolysis and neurotoxicity. The systemic myotoxic action of this venom was demonstrated in 1985. In the present paper we report clinical and laboratory data concerning three patients bitten by C. durissus terrificus and treated at the University Hospital of Ribeir\u00e3o Preto, University of S\u00e3o Paulo. The normal haptoglobin levels detected in the serum of these patients during the first 48 hr after the accident, as well as the absence of hemoglobin in darkened urine samples as evaluated by immunodiffusion against anti-hemoglobin serum, rule out the occurrence of intravascular hemolysis. These data permit us to conclude that the signs and symptoms observed in human envenomation with C. durissus terrificus are due to a myotoxic and neurotoxic action of the venom."

        "abstract": "Seven human cell lines derived from squamous carcinomas of the tongue and larynx were examined for their ability to produce and secrete proteinases. All cell lines were able to release into the culture medium cysteine proteinase and plasminogen activator-like activities. All lines differed from each other in the amount of enzymes secreted, in the kinetics of the secretion, in the quality of the enzymes produced an in the intracellular pool of these activities. These features constitute potential criteria for classifying the biochemical behavior of the tumor cell lines and for explaining their different ability to invade soft tissues and bone."

        "abstract": "Twenty-four adults (10 male; age 27-65 years, median 43.5) with hepatic haemangioma are reviewed. Fifteen had right hypochondrial pain (lesions 8 cm or more in diameter in nine). Six lesions were found incidentally, at ultrasound examination or elective cholecystectomy. Diagnosis, from ultrasonic and angiographic appearances, was confirmed in 12 by percutaneous biopsy without complication. Eleven patients were followed untreated for up to 60 months (median 24 months): lesion size (median 2.5 cm) did not change and all remained well. Surgical resection succeeded in two of three patients; the third and eight other patients (seven with symptoms) with lesions 3 to 30 cm in diameter were selected for Gelfoam embolization. Transient minor side effects preceded improvement in most, but two patients (with lesions of 20 cm or greater in diameter) developed multiple liver abscesses: recovery was protracted. Embolization failed in three; two remain well, untreated, to 24 and 51 months. Two patients had hepatic artery ligation, one with radiotherapy. Further imaging at from eight to 60 months (median 24) showed little change in lesion size or vascularity with any non-resectional technique. Expectant management of small asymptomatic haemangiomas appears appropriate. Embolization may reduce pain but the risk of abscess formation is high for large tumours, and reduction in size or vascularity of lesions is unlikely whatever their initial diameter."

        "abstract": "The effects of epidural fentanyl, sufentanil, carfentanil, lofentanil and alfentanil were compared in the rat. All five opiates produced analgesia with the relative order of potency being lofentanil greater than carfentanil greater than sufentanil greater than fentanyl greater than alfentanil, and the relative order of duration at comparative doses lofentanil greater than sufentanil greater than carfentanil greater than fentanyl greater than alfentanil. Because epidural administered opiates still exert some effects within the brain, specificity ratios (defined as the ratio between the ED50s for a prolongation of the tail-withdrawal reaction latency and a blockade of the pinna reflex) were calculated. The relative order of specificity between the five opiates was fentanyl greater than lofentanil greater than sufentanil greater than carfentanil greater than alfentanil. These results are discussed in the context of the search for a safe and sufficiently long-acting lipid soluble epidural analgesic. It is concluded that of these five opiates, sufentanil appears to be the best drug of choice for epidural analgesia."

        "abstract": "A 70-year-old man, with regional herpes zoster (C2) of 10 weeks duration, died following subarachnoid hemorrhage caused by the rupture of an aneurysm in the basilar artery. Granulomatous angiitis, with multinucleated giant cells, was found at autopsy in the wall of the aneurysm. Electron microscopy of the basilar artery disclosed intracytoplasmic viral particles with an envelope which measured 150-220 nm in diameter. Immunohistochemistry studies revealed varicella-zoster-virus-related antigen in the cytoplasm and/or in the nucleus of histiocytes in the vessel wall. These findings suggest that varicella-zoster virus may be linked to the development of granulomatous angiitis."

It could be further purified from the d greater than 1.24 g/ml fraction by affinity chromatography on heparin-Sepharose and hydrophobic interaction chromatography on phenyl-Sepharose. The content of inhibitory activity was found to vary over a 4-fold range in sera of apparently healthy persons."

        "abstract": "The methods most frequently employed for the study of analgesic activity of opiates are those based on thermal stimuli (hot-plate, tail-flick, TWR). These tests, however, are only sensitive for opiates which are pure agonists. In this work, we propose a modification of the TWR method capable of detecting analgesic activity in both agonist and agonist-antagonist opiates. In addition, non-opiate analgesics also show activity in this test. The ED50 (mg/kg, i.p.) of the substances studied, administered 30 min before commencement of the test, were as follows: buprenorphine: 0.02; methadone: 0.08; morphine: 1.9; pentazocine: 4.5; d-propoxyphene: 5.5; codeine: 7.6; pethidine: 9.2; zomepirac: 20.1; suprofen: 138.0; acetylsalicylic acid: 453.4. There was a statistically significant linear correlation between the results obtained by the proposed method (MTT) and those of some of the most frequently used methods for the study of analgesic agents (writhing induced by phenylbenzoquinone, acetic acid, acetylcholine bromide, hot-plate test and rat tail withdrawal test). The simplicity of the method makes it suitable for use in the battery of screening tests for analgesic activity of both narcotic and non-narcotic substances."

The assay takes advantage of nitrocellulose membranes as antigen adsorbent on which a dilute sample can be concentrated as a spot, using a specially designed 96-well filtration device which is commercially available. The method requires only 6 micrograms of the extracts from leukocytes and liver, and it is 10 times more sensitive than the colorimetric assay. This reduced amount of sample material also has the merit of requiring only a 0.5-ml blood sample from patients. The combination of this dot immunoassay with the monoclonal antibody allows a sensitive and a specific assay, and is also applicable as a screening test on a large number of samples. Furthermore, the possibility of differential diagnosis of Niemann-Pick disease types by detecting isoenzymes by this method was examined after isoelectric focusing of placental sphingomyelinase."

        "abstract": "For the determination of the health hazards to humans of inhaled dust particles, precise collection and evaluation techniques are needed. The sampling system has to be designed in order to obtain representative samples and has also to take into consideration the type of electron microscopy evaluation which will be applied. A convenient method is the collection of dust particles on conventional membrane filters (MF) or on Nuclepore polycarbonate filters (NPF); their characteristics are outlined. The preparation of filters is a decisive procedure, both for SEM (low magnification) and for TEM evaluation. The advantages and disadvantages of the two electron microscopic techniques are described and discussed. As an example of practical application, the results of ambient air fiber measurements in the cities of D\u00fcsseldorf and Duisburg, and in an urban site 50 km away from the nearest city for the period 1981-83 are reported. From these results, it seems possible to obtain useful and realistic informations on particulate air pollutants when using both electron microscopy techniques."

        "abstract": "Six years have passed since the beginning of health services for the aged in 1983. The second 5-year program of health services for the aged has just started. Health education, health consultation, and health examination for cancer prevention are now in the stage for evaluation. It is difficult, however, to get agreement on the effectiveness. I would recommend a sampling method for a comprehensive evaluation. Exploration of other methods will be developed by epidemiologists, and that will contribute to the planning by the government in cancer control for the next 5-year program. The content of health education has been of single pattern. It should be different to educate what should be done by inhabitants or individuals depending on their way of life, local specificity and other factors. So it is necessary to explore the method to serve effective health education considering these differences. The informations necessary for such planning could be easily obtained from the health center or other public institutes, so that health professionals can apply these effective methods for health education."

        "abstract": "A novel polypeptide inhibitor, AI-3688, which acts upon human pancreatic alpha-amylase, was isolated from fermentation broth of Streptomyces aureofaciens. The purified peptide contains no unusual amino acids. Its Mr is 3936. The primary structure of AI-3688 was elucidated by automatic Edman degradation of the native or modified inhibitor. Two intramolecular cysteines form a disulphide bridge, thus creating a ring structure consisting of 17 amino acids. Strong sequence homology also exists to another microbial alpha-amylase inhibitor, tendamistat (HOE 467). This paper discusses the role of a common partial sequence, -Gln-Ser-Trp-Arg-Tyr-, present in the loop of both inhibitors as the active site of microbial peptide alpha-amylase inhibitors."

        "abstract": "MK-733 (simvastatin), a potent 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, was found to inhibit the absorption of cholesterol from the gastrointestinal tract in cholesterol-fed rabbits (Ishida et al. (1988) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 963, 35-41). To clarify the mechanism of action, the effects of MK-733 on acyl coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) and cholesterol esterase activities, which are thought to participate in the absorption of cholesterol, were examined. Dietary administration (0.03% in a 1% cholesterol diet for 7 days, approx. 10 mg/kg) of MK-733 to cholesterol-fed rabbits was found to inhibit the increase in serum total cholesterol levels, and caused a 70% reduction in ACAT activity in microsomes of intestinal mucosa relative to those observed in concurrent control rabbits. MK-733 did not affect cholesterol esterase activity in the cytosol of the intestinal mucosa. The inhibitory effect of MK-733 on cholesterol absorption in cholesterol-fed rabbits is though to be related to a reduction in microsomal ACAT activity in the intestinal mucosa."

        "abstract": "Alterations in triacylglycerol and phospholipid metabolism are known to occur during the evolution of myocardial ischemic injury. The purpose of this study was to explore potential relationships between the accumulation of arachidonic acid and other fatty acids, the accumulation of triacylglycerol, and the progression of myocardial injury. Measurements of the fatty acid levels in triacylglycerol, unesterified fatty acids, and calcium content were correlated with myocardial function during ischemia and ischemia with reflow in an isolated perfused rat heart preparation. After 10 minutes of ischemia in this model, myocardial dysfunction was reversible, with recovery of left ventricular +dP/dt to 82.0% +/- 4.8% of control values upon reperfusion. Hearts did not recover with reperfusion after 30 minutes of ischemia and displayed a significant increase in tissue calcium content. A significant, nearly threefold increase in the arachidonic acid content of triacylglycerol was found after 10 minutes of ischemia and continued to increase with longer periods of ischemia and reflow. Other fatty acids also showed increased levels in triacylglycerol. The time course of accumulation of unesterified arachidonic acid paralleled the loss of myocardial function. Levels of free arachidonic acid were (in nanomoles per gram wet weight) 11.1 +/- 2.1 (SEM) for control hearts, 17.3 +/- 1.9 after 10 minutes of ischemia, and 38.4 +/- 2.5 after 30 minutes of ischemia. Increases in other free fatty acids contributed to a significant increase in total free fatty acid accumulation after 30 minutes of ischemia. Thus, the content of arachidonic and other fatty acids in triacylglycerol was found to increase early during ischemia, and a major increase in free arachidonic and other unesterified fatty acids occurred after a longer period of ischemia. These findings are consistent with an initial reincorporation of free fatty acids into triacylglycerol after release from membrane phospholipids, suggesting that membrane fatty acids may be a major source of triacylglycerol that accumulates in ischemic myocardium. In addition, these results suggest that a major increase in free fatty acids during ischemia and ischemia with reflow correlates temporally with the development of severe contractile dysfunction and accumulation of calcium in the heart."

        "abstract": "Smoking \"crack\" is currently popular; this results in rapidly peaking, high blood levels of cocaine. Our purpose was to investigate the effects of rapid cocaine administration. Hemodynamics, myocardial blood flow, and left ventricular cavity end-systolic and end-diastolic areas were measured in pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs before and 15 minutes after (1) a bolus intravenous injection of cocaine (n = 6), or (2) a 10-minute infusion of cocaine (n = 6), or (3) saline (n = 6) administration. In both treated groups cocaine caused a significant reduction in heart rate and left ventricular dP/dt compared with baseline measurements, and an increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. Cocaine also caused dilation of the left ventricle and a fall in regional myocardial blood flow. In nine other dogs, proximal circumflex artery diameter, assessed by angiography, and regional myocardial blood flow were measured before and 3 to 5 minutes after cocaine (n = 7) or saline (n = 2). In treated animals, circumflex artery diameter was reduced 15 +/- 4% (range 2% to 29%, p less than 0.01 versus baseline) after cocaine. We conclude that in this model, rapid administration of cocaine depresses left ventricular function, causes left ventricular dilation, and is associated with coronary artery vasoconstriction and reduced myocardial blood flow."

        "article_title": "Epileptic brain damage: pathophysiology and neurochemical pathology.",
        "abstract": "In this chapter, the pathophysiology and neurochemical pathology of epileptic brain damage is discussed on the basis of an integrative approach in which a comparison is made to cell necrosis resulting from ischemia and hypoglycemia. Two main questions are asked. First, is the brain damage resulting from these three disorders of cerebral energy metabolism similar in distribution and structural characteristics, as previously proposed? Second, is it possible to identify one or several neurochemical events, at the cellular and subcellular level, that qualify as the final common pathways leading to neuronal necrosis? A related question is, will seizures cause structural damage even if they do not critically curtail cellular oxygen supply? A review of the literature and of recent results obtained in animals with long-term recovery following status epilepticus of known duration suggests that although brain damage caused by epilepsy shows some similarities to that incurred due to ischemic and hypoglycemic insults, it is far from identical. In well oxygenated animals with an adequate cardiovascular function, 2 hr of status epilepticus causes moderate neuronal necrosis in the cerebral cortex (layers 3-4), the hippocampus (CA4 and CA1 pyramidal cells), and the thalamus (ventromedial nuclei). In rats, status epilepticus of 30 min duration or longer invariably causes infarction of the substantia nigra (pars reticularis), with some affectation of globus pallidus as well. Notably, CA3 pyramids and dentate neurons are spared, as is the pars compacta of the substantia nigra. Neurochemical events in ischemia, hypoglycemia, and status epilepticus show some striking dissimilarities, yet all three conditions lead to neuronal necrosis. In complete or near-complete ischemia, in which metabolic rate virtually ceases; deterioration of tissue energy state is rapid and extensive, with dramatic loss of ion homeostasis; cellular redox systems are reduced; and acidosis is marked to excessive. In hypoglycemic coma, oxygen consumption continues, albeit at a reduced rate; loss of high energy phosphates is extensive but less than complete, as is loss of ion homeostasis; cellular redox system become oxidized; and acidosis is absent. In epileptic seizures, finally, metabolic rate is markedly enhanced; perturbation of tissue energy state and of ion homeostasis is minimal to small; and acidosis is moderate. Results obtained in experimental animals suggest that neuronal necrosis, when incurred, is unrelated to energy failure and occurs in spite of adequate cellular oxygenation. Four neurochemical events are common to all three conditions discussed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

        "abstract": "The water-soluble probe carboxyfluorescein (CF), contained in the internal aqueous phase of liposomes, was used to investigate the interaction of phospholipid vesicles with isolated nuclei. Ultrastructural analysis indicated that adherent liposomes coated the nuclear surface, and fluorescence microscopy showed that they contained quenching concentrations of the dye. Flow cytometry revealed that the transfer of the entrapped dye from the adhering liposomes to nuclei was blocked by chilling at 0 degrees C. Chase experiments demonstrated that the most reliable mechanism of dye transfer involved fusion phenomena between the liposomal and the nuclear membranes. After the release of the fluorophore into the nucleus, empty liposomes could withdraw the intranuclear soluble fraction of the dye."

        "abstract": "Imidazoline derivatives, clonidine and guanfacine, were reviewed with respect to their effect on blood pressure. Excitation of the central alpha-adrenoceptors induced by clonidine or guanfacine produced a simultaneous decrease in peripheral sympathetic tone, hypotension and bradycardia. Both ponto-medullary regions and the hypothalamus are important action sites for these two drugs. With respect to the effects of clonidine or guanfacine on central alpha-adrenoceptors, two possibilities were investigated. First, we presumed that the excitation of central alpha-adrenoceptors induced by these two drugs appears to be located at postsynaptic sites. Thus, the alpha 2-subtype was considered. Secondarily, stimulation of the central presynaptic alpha 2 receptor produced by clonidine or guanfacine could not be excluded completely. It has been reported that after abrupt cessation of guanfacine, a withdrawal syndrome infrequently occurs which is moderate as compared with that caused by the abrupt cessation of clonidine. In comparison with clonidine, the characteristics of guanfacine pharmacokinetics, including its large volume of distribution, long biological half life and long duration of action, appear to be associated with the infrequent occurrence of withdrawal syndrome after guanfacine cessation."

        "abstract": "This study investigated the effect of learning/memory-related neuropeptides on behavioral task performance in later life. A 1 mg/kg dosage of adrenocorticotropic hormone 4-9, Organon 2766, ACTH/MSH 4-10, ACTH 1-24, CRF, or diluent was subcutaneously injected into either pregnant females or into newborn pups during specific neural developmental windows. Each of the progeny was trained in an active-avoidance task and tested for acquisition on postpartum days 35-37. The mice were then tested for memory task performance and reacquisition on days 42-44 postpartum using the identical experimental paradigm as that used in the training sessions. Prenatal treatment with these memory-related neuropeptides resulted in significant facilitation of learning/memory task performance in male and female mice treated with Organon 2766 (p less than 0.001), and a significant inhibition of learning/memory task performance in males and females treated with ACTH 1-24 (p less than 0.01). Additional sex-specific performance facilitations and inhibitions resulted from the pre- or postnatal administration of the various neuropeptides used in this study. These results suggest that neuropeptides, when available in increased amounts during specific neural developmental windows, can significantly improve or suppress related behavioral performance capability in later life."

        "abstract": "Studies were conducted to evaluate the effects of celiprolol on alpha-adrenergic stimulation of dog saphenous vein rings (postsynaptic effect) and on catecholamine outflow from the dog coronary circulation during sympathetic nerve stimulation in vivo (presynaptic effect). In venous rings, celiprolol, 10(-6) to 10(-4) M, shifted the concentration-response curve to BHT 920 in a concentration-related manner, but had no effect on the response to methoxamine at concentrations less than 10(-4) M. During continuous stimulation of the right stellate ganglion, celiprolol, 1-10 mg/kg i.v., increased the catecholamine concentration in the coronary sinus, while decreasing heart rate. In contrast, propranolol did not affect catecholamine concentration but decreased heart rate, rauwolscine increased both catecholamine concentration and heart rate, and clonidine decreased both catecholamine concentration and heart rate. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that celiprolol possesses weak alpha 2-antagonist properties in addition to its beta 1-blocking activity."

        "abstract": "These studies were designed to: (1) determine the effects of continuous infusion of synthetic ACTH(1-24) on postcastration changes in serum and pituitary LH, FSH and prolactin in the male rat; (2) assess the effects of adrenalectomy on the gonadotropin and prolactin response to ACTH, and (3) test the hypothesis that ACTH may directly (not via adrenal factors) alter gonadotropin secretion at the brain and/or pituitary level. Adult male rats were either orchidectomized (ORX) or orchidectomized-adrenalectomized (ORX-ADX), and were treated continuously for 6 days with ACTH(1-24) (10 micrograms/day) or saline using an osmotic minipump. Animals were killed on day 6 following castration. ACTH treatment reduced serum LH and prolactin levels in ORX rats to mean values +/- SE of 204 +/- 25 and 37 +/- 3 ng/ml respectively, compared to 366 +/- 72 and 62 +/- 7 ng/ml in saline-treated ORX animals. Serum FSH concentrations were not altered by ACTH administration. Pituitary concentrations of LH and FSH, but not prolactin were enhanced by ACTH treatment. Adrenalectomy had no effect on serum and pituitary gonadotropin and prolactin levels, but abolished the effects of ACTH on these parameters. Central (intracerebroventricular) infusion of ACTH(1-24) (6 micrograms/day X 4 days) failed to alter the rise in serum LH in male rats following orchidectomy. Acute treatment with large doses of ACTH of perifused anterior pituitary glands from male rats and chronic treatment with ACTH of enzymatically dispersed anterior pituitary cells from female rats did not influence basal or GnRH-stimulated LH secretion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

        "abstract": "Unconditioned and conditioned effects of house-light offset and acoustic white noise on barpressing behavior maintained by intermittent food reinforcement were tested in male hooded rats. Presentations of these stimuli prior to their acquiring signal value initially tended to depress and then to enhance barpressing rate, but generally the rate of the on-going barpressing was lower during the light offset then during noise presentations. Subsequently, one stimulus was used to signal continuous food reinforcement, evoking conditioned enhancement, and the other to signal inescapable footshock eliciting conditioned suppression of barpressing. The enhancement was acquired more rapidly than the suppression, independent of the stimulus modality used. The stimulus modality effect emerged when the continuous food reinforcement was withdrawn, since enhancement elicited by light offset extinguished more rapidly than elicited by noise. The stimulus modality effect was stronger when the other stimulus continued to signal pain and was attenuated when conditioned suppression was also extinguished. During the next stage of the experiment, the signal values of the conditioned stimuli were reversed, resulting in easy transformation of conditioned suppression into conditioned enhancement and vice versa. The stimuli used and changes in their signal values exerted clear effects on the rate of barpressing during intertrial intervals and this, in turn, somewhat modulated the behavioral effects of the conditioned stimuli. These results indicate that unconditioned effects of the stimuli on the behavior interact with their properties acquired in the course of conditioning."

        "abstract": "An explanation for the origins of four classes of regularly occurring duplication and deficiency chromosomes is provided through examination of their molecular structures. The duplications and deficiencies occur as the reciprocal products of crossing-over, following two different patterns of asymmetrical synapsis between transposons positioned in and proximal to the white locus of Drosophila melanogaster. Three copies of the retrovirus-like transposon roo are involved in the exchanges. Evidence suggests that transposon-mediated asymmetrical exchange is a general phenomenon in eukaryotes, which adds significantly to the effects of transposons in the restructuring of eukaryotic genomes."

        "abstract": "Sex steroid treatment is associated with side effects. The number of deaths and morbidity cases in 425 transsexual patients treated with cross-gender hormones were evaluated retrospectively and compared with the expected number in a similar reference group of the population. The number of deaths in male-to-female transsexuals was five times the number expected, due to increased numbers of suicide and death of unknown cause. Combined treatment with estrogen and cyproterone acetate in 303 male-to-female transsexuals was associated with a 45-fold increase of thromboembolic events, hyperprolactinemia (400-fold), depressive mood changes (15-fold), and transient elevation of liver enzymes. Androgen treatment in 122 female-to-male transsexuals was associated with weight increase greater than 10% (17.2%) and acne (12.3%). In both groups persistent liver enzyme abnormalities could be attributed to other causes than sex steroids (hepatitis B and alcohol abuse). Much of the morbidity was minor and reversible with appropriate treatment or temporary discontinuation of hormone treatment. Thus, the dilemma of prescribing cross gender hormones in view of the needs of these patients is not resolved. Explanation of possible side effects and careful clinical judgment remain the cornerstone of the clinical decision to prescribe cross-gender hormones. Furthermore, follow up of this relatively young population to disclose long-term side effects and to elucidate the association of sex steroids with coronary heart disease, as well as efforts to reduce the risk of thromboembolic events, are required."

        "abstract": "Stimulated mast cells produce and release adenosine, and the release of mast cell mediators is potentiated by adenosine, yet very little is known regarding mast cell purine metabolism. Because 5-amino-4-imidazolecarboxamide riboside (AICA riboside) has been shown to alter adenosine metabolism and accelerate the repletion of ATP pools in other tissues, its effects on mast cell function were examined. Neither simultaneous addition of A23187 and AICA riboside nor a 1-hr preincubation with AICA riboside altered mast cell beta-hexosaminidase release to an appreciable degree. However, mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells cultured for 2 or more days in the presence of 1-100 microM AICA riboside exhibited a markedly attenuated mediator release response to A23187 compared to control cells with or without the additional presence of adenosine. IgE-mediated leukotriene C4 generation from AICA riboside-exposed mast cells was even more profoundly inhibited without affecting cell viability or resting mediator content. An unusual ribonucleotide triphosphate previously identified in folate-depleted cells, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-beta-D-ribofuranosyl 5'-triphosphate (ZTP), has been identified in AICA riboside-treated mast cells as well. Although the mechanism of this global inhibition of mast cell mediator release by chronic AICA riboside treatment is not clear, alterations in mast cell purine metabolism may prove to be important in the treatment of allergic diseases."

A variety of instructional strategies described in the literature which claim to enhance the effectiveness of student learning in the clinical setting and promote role adjustment immediately upon graduation have been used by nursing faculty and nursing service personnel. Preceptorship is one such strategy. The author reviews the evolution of preceptorship within the nursing profession and explores factors which are provoking current interest in this concept. Available empirical data regarding the effect of preceptorship on student and graduate nurse performance in the clinical setting are presented and implications for nursing education discussed."

        "abstract": "The relation of pacing rate to physiologic variables of metabolic demand was examined in 10 consecutive patients with a minute ventilation-sensing, rate-modulating ventricular pacemaker implanted for complete heart block. All patients had paroxysmal (seven patients) or chronic (three patients) atrial fibrillation and were referred for catheter ablation of the atrioventricular junction. Treadmill exercise testing with measurement of expired gas exchange and respiratory flow was performed before ablation and 4 weeks after pacemaker implantation, with the pacemaker programmed to both the fixed-rate VVI and rate-modulating minute ventilation VVIR pacing modes in random sequence. The relation of pacing rate to oxygen consumption (VO2), expired carbon dioxide concentration (VCO2), respiratory quotient, tidal volume, respiratory rate and minute ventilation was determined during exercise in the rate-modulating minute ventilation pacing mode. Pacing rate was highly correlated with minute ventilation (r = 0.89), respiratory quotient (r = 0.89), VCO2 (r = 0.87), tidal volume (r = 0.87), VO2 (r = 0.84) and respiratory rate (r = 0.84). The mean exercise duration increased from 8.3 +/- 2.8 min in the fixed rate pacing mode to 10.2 +/- 3.4 min in the rate-modulating, minute ventilation mode (p = 0.0001). The maximal VO2 increased from 13.4 +/- 3.4 to 16.3 +/- 4.1 cc/kg per min (p = 0.0004). The maximal heart rate achieved in the minute ventilation pacing mode was 136 +/- 9.7 beats/min, similar to that observed in the patient's intrinsic cardiac rhythm before ablation (134.9 +/- 30.1 beats/min, p = NS).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

This is a review of recent work that has examined both the nature of age-related impairments on spatial tasks, and the relation of such deficits to underlying neurobiological mechanisms. The review supports the notion that hippocampal dysfunction underlies the mild/moderate cognitive decline that often accompanies normal aging. Thus the spatial learning deficit in aged rodents is a promising model for understanding the effect of age on brain systems that serve a memory function in humans."

        "abstract": "We used immunoperoxidase methods employing antibodies against involucrin and filaggrin, both markers of squamous terminal differentiation, to study squamous metaplastic transformation in the human endocervix. Expression of involucrin and filaggrin was restricted to squamous metaplastic cells whereas columnar epithelial cells were constantly negative. Immature squamous metaplastic epithelium also showed a positive immunostaining. In mature squamous metaplasia a suprabasal homogeneous staining pattern similar to that found in the exocervical epithelium was detected, although with full-thickness filaggrin immunoreactivity in 45% of cases (P less than 0.05). These results support the hypothesis of an epithelial origin of reserve subcolumnar cells, and suggest that precocious squamous differentiation seems to take place in metaplastic cells of the human endocervix."

        "abstract": "Pneumopericardium is a rare condition, most frequently reported in connection with prolonged artificial ventilation in infants with hyaline membrane disease. No reports of pneumopericardium after pulmonary surgery have been published. Two cases of pneumopericardium are reported, one of tension pneumopericardium after pneumonectomy and artificial ventilation and one that followed radical lobectomy and artificial ventilation. The radiographic findings included pneumopericardium and subcutaneous emphysema and the patient who had had a pneumonectomy had severe symptoms of cardiac tamponade. Prolonged artificial ventilation in patients after pulmonary surgery and in the presence of an intrathoracic air leak may be a hazard. The importance of prompt surgical intervention in cases of tension pneumopericardium is underlined; the treatment of choice is thoracotomy with pericardiotomy."

        "article_title": "Selective effects of ECT on hypothalamic-pituitary activity.",
        "abstract": "The hypothesis that ECT produces selective effects on hypothalamic-pituitary activity was investigated by determining the effect of ECT on pituitary hormone release in nine depressed patients. After ECT there were massive and rapid increases in the plasma concentrations of nicotine- and oestrogen-stimulated neurophysin (NSN and ESN), prolactin (PRL) and adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), smaller increases in plasma luteinizing hormone (LH) and cortisol, a significant decrease in plasma growth hormone (GH) concentration but no change in plasma thyrotropin (TSH). There was significant attenuation of PRL responses with repeated ECT. The hormonal responses to ECT cannot simply be attributed to stress, since a similar pattern of increases in plasma hormone concentrations did not occur in psychologically normal patients in whom plasma hormone concentrations were measured during induction of anaesthesia and abdominal incision for cholecystectomy. Analysis of these hormonal responses in terms of the knowledge available on the neurotransmitter control of pituitary hormone release suggests that some of these hormonal responses to ECT may be mediated by the activation of serotonergic neurones, while others are probably due to direct stimulation of the neuroendocrine neurones themselves."

        "article_title": "The effects of epinephrine on islet hormone secretion in the dog.",
        "abstract": "We investigated the direct effects of physiological levels of epinephrine on the basal and arginine-stimulated secretion of insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin from the in situ pancreas in halothane-anaesthetized dogs. An IV infusion of 20 ng/kg/min of epinephrine increased plasma epinephrine levels to 918 +/- 103 pg/ml (P less than 0.001), and increased the baseline pancreatic output of insulin (P less than 0.05), glucagon (P less than 0.05) and somatostatin (P less than 0.05). The acute insulin response (AIR) to 2.5 g of arginine during this infusion of epinephrine was significantly higher (P less than 0.05) than in controls as were the acute glucagon response (AGR) (P less than 0.05) and the acute somatostatin response (ASLIR) (P less than 0.05). Plasma glucose levels increased slightly and transiently during infusion of epinephrine from 99 +/- 2 mg/dl to a maximum of 110 +/- 3 mg/dl (P less than 0.05). An IV infusion of 80 ng/kg/min of epinephrine produced plasma epinephrine levels of 2,948 +/- 281 pg/ml, and increased the baseline pancreatic output of insulin (P less than 0.05) and glucagon (P less than 0.05). In contrast, baseline somatostatin output decreased transiently during this high dose infusion of epinephrine. The AIR and ASLIR to arginine were both significantly lower (P less than 0.05) than those during the infusion of epinephrine at the low dose. The AGR to arginine remained potentiated (P less than 0.05). Plasma glucose levels increased from 99 +/- 3 mg/dl to 119 +/- 4 mg/dl (P less than 0.01). We conclude that the effect of epinephrine on islet hormone secretion is dependent on the plasma level of epinephrine. At stress levels of 900-1000 pg/ml, both insulin and somatostatin secretion are stimulated; only at near pharmacologic, or extreme stress levels, does epinephrine produce net inhibition."

        "article_title": "[Results of micro(vascular) surgical interventions in vascular-induced disorders of erection].",
        "abstract": "In 71 patients aged 20 to 65 years who suffered from erectile dysfunction of vascular (mainly arterial and venous) origin, we performed 66 microsurgical vascular reconstructions (12 according to Michal II, 42 using Virag I, 5 using the Hauri modification and 7 according to the author's own method) and 5 operations to reduce venous outflow from the corpora cavernosa. In addition, 6 Virag I redo reconstructions and other secondary interventions in 18 cases were performed as well as (semi-)conservative therapeutic measures were undertaken. Over a mean follow-up period of 35.1 months 46 out of 56 men were again able to have adequate to normal sexual intercourse. The other patients showed only minimal improvement or their condition remained unchanged. No patient's condition was seen to worsen. The main complications were occlusions of the reconstruction and the hypervascularization syndrome of the penis, affecting 13.3% of the arterio-venous anastomoses. This complication, which often occurred many months postoperatively, was always overcome with banding and in some cases by additional venous ligatures so that a functional reconstruction remained in all but one case. In cases of erectile dysfunction of vascular origin, vascular surgery presents the most natural form of therapy and therefore deserves consideration before life-long auto-injection therapy is prescribed for the corpora cavernosa or the implantation of a penis prosthesis is considered. Specific angiological investigation is advisable in all cases in which a four- to six-month course of (semi-)conservative treatment does not bring long-term success."

        "abstract": "Recent reports have suggested that a small optic cup may contribute to the development of certain optic disc disorders, such as anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. In a masked fashion, the cup-to-disc ratios from the fellow eyes of 55 patients with central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) were compared with 55 controls to determine whether a similar association could be established for CRVO. Controls came from two population-based surveys, and they were matched to cases for age, race, and sex. The mean cup-to-disc ratios for the CRVO fellow eyes and controls were 0.39 and 0.40, respectively; the distribution of the sizes of the cup-to-disc ratios was nearly identical in the two groups. These results suggested that the cup-to-disc ratio is not a useful predictor of the development of CRVO."

        "abstract": "We correlated neuroanatomical developmental parameters with sequential ultrasonography scans to reveal the structural basis of functional recovery after early focal hypoxic lesions of the human frontal lobe in premature infants. We studied the transient fetal subplate zone in the premotor and prefrontal cortex in premature, newborn, infant, and young adult brains by acetylcholinesterase (AChE) histochemical, Golgi, and immunocytochemical methods. The structural in vivo rearrangements of the cerebral wall after perinatal lesions were studied on serial real-time sector scans (5-MHz transducer). The subplate zone contains \"waiting\" axons and randomly oriented fetal neurons, its developmental peak is between 22 and 34 weeks of gestation, and it is present in the frontal cortex of newborns and disappears after the sixth postnatal month, but individual subplate-like neurons remain until adulthood. Ultrasonography revealed remarkable structural rearrangements of the cerebral wall when the hypoxic lesion occurred during the developmental peak of the subplate zone: anechoic cavities (\"cysts\") develop rapidly (within 3 weeks) in premature brains, the rebuilding of these lesions continues after birth, and cavities disappear around the 11th month. We propose that the transient population of \"waiting\" axons and cells of the subplate zone participate in the structural and functional plasticity of the human cerebral cortex after perinatal brain damage."

        "abstract": "Immunoprecipitation of native rat liver microsomal 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, phosphorylated by [gamma-32P]ATP in the presence of reductase kinase, revealed a major 97-kDa 32P band which disappeared upon competition with pure unlabeled 53-kDa HMG-CoA reductase. A linear correlation between the expressed/total HMG-CoA reductase activity ratio (E/T) and the fraction of 32P released from the 97-kDa enzyme established the validity of the E/T ratio as an index of HMG-CoA reductase phosphorylation state in isolated microsomes. Incubation of rat hepatocytes with mevalonolactone resulted in a rapid increase in phosphorylation of microsomal reductase (decrease in E/T) followed by an enhanced rate of decay of total reductase activity which was proportional to the loss of 97-kDa enzyme mass determined by immunoblots. Inhibitors of lysosome function dampened both basal and mevalonate-induced reductase degradation in hepatocytes. In an in vitro system using the calcium-dependent protease calpain-2, up to 5-fold greater yields of soluble 52-56-kDa fragments of reductase (immunoblot and total activity) were obtained when the substrate 97-kDa reductase was phosphorylated before proteolysis. Immunoblots of unlabeled phosphorylated reductase compared with gels of immunoprecipitated 32P-labeled reductase resolved a 52-56-kDa doublet which contained 32P solely in the upper band. These data suggest that a major phosphorylation site of HMG-CoA reductase lies within the \"linker\" segment joining the membrane spanning and cytoplasmic domains of the native 97-kDa protein."

        "abstract": "The transfer of rotavirus antibodies from 25 healthy mothers to their breast-fed infants was investigated during the period of lactation (mean, 3.9 months; range, 1-9 months). Furthermore, the destiny of these antibodies in the infants' gastrointestinal tract and serum was examined. Rotavirus-specific immunoglobulins were analyzed by the ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) technique. All the mothers had rotavirus IgA and IgG in serum. About 80% of the mothers had low concentrations of rotavirus ScIg (i.e., antirotavirus immunoglobulin containing secretory component) in serum at the beginning of the lactation period declining to about 45% at the end of the period. From a few days after delivery to about 2 weeks later, the concentrations of rotavirus IgA and ScIg in milk declined. Thereafter, they remained unchanged. There was a positive correlation among the concentrations of rotavirus IgA in serum and rotavirus IgA as well as ScIg in milk. Rotavirus IgG in the infants' serum correlated with that of the mothers. Few samples of the infants' duodenal fluid contained rotavirus IgA or ScIg. On the other hand, about 80% of the infants' fecal samples contained rotavirus ScIg and IgA. Rotavirus IgA and ScIg disappeared from the infants' feces after cessation of lactation. Hence, it may be concluded that infants receive rotavirus IgG through the placenta, and rotavirus ScIg and IgA in constant amounts via milk throughout the period of lactation. The small intestine is flushed with rotavirus ScIg and IgA at each breast-meal, and these antibodies survive proteolysis in the gut. A possible protectional effect of rotavirus ScIg or IgA requires frequent breast-meals, and the effect is limited to the period of lactation."

There was correlation in 67% of cases, in 28% the disease was overstaged, and in only 5% was it understaged by intraoperative assessment. This has important implications for the comparison of trials and management decisions based on surgical assessment."

        "abstract": "The theory developed here locates mental illness in a biosocial context involving social bonds. Because of the inclusion of both social and emotional elements, light may be shed on how mental illness originates, the part played by family, agents of social control, and society. Labeling and stigma may rest on strong unacknowledged emotions, particularly shame and anger. The shame construct is used to provide a model of mental illness at the intra/interpersonal and societal levels, which involves a bilateral relationship between the labeled and the labelers. I use excerpts from a psychiatric interview to illustrate my model. Although preliminary, the findings point to the role of shame in mental illness; it may figure in both the formation of symptoms and their maintenance."

Depolymerization of microtubules with colchicin and vinblastine decreased an apparent affinity of veratrine to its receptor in the channel, while destruction of microfilaments with cytochalasin B had the opposite effect. Colchicine did not change allosteric interactions between the receptor for veratrine and that for scorpion venom in the sodium channel evaluated by the ability of scorpion venom to facilitate veratrine-induced depolarization of synaptosomes. It is suggested that two main cytoskeleton subsystems control the state of sodium channels in the nerve ending."

Past research has provided evidence for both phonological (sound-based) and cherological (sign-based) encoding, the former typically found with hearing subjects and the latter with deaf users of sign language. In the present experiment, encoding capabilities were delineated from encoding preferences, using 58 subjects comprising six groups differing in hearing ability and linguistic experience. Phonologically related, cherologically related, and control lists were presented orally, manually, or through both modalities simultaneously. Recall performance indicated that individuals encode flexibly, the code actually used being biased by incoming stimulus characteristics. Subjects with both sign and speech experience recalled simultaneous presentations better than ones presented orally or manually alone, which reveals the occurrence of enhanced encoding as a function of linguistic experience. Total linguistic experience appeared to determine recall accuracy following different types of encoding, rather than determining the encoding basis used."

This study also tested for an interaction between the drugs and alcohol on the eighth day. Subjective ratings, psychomotor and memory performance were evaluated. Diazepam produced the typical pattern of changes, namely impairments in psychomotor performance and reductions in the retention of newly memorised information. In contrast, the effects of pipequaline were relatively minor. In general, neither drug potentiated the effects of alcohol on performance, only isolated instances of non-additive interactions occurring. Subjective reports revealed that whereas both active drugs increased feelings of calmness, this result was accomplished by pipequaline with considerably less drowsiness, no euphoria and a general absence of the adverse side effects of diazepam."

        "abstract": "Twenty-three normal volunteers and 31 women admitted for stress or mixed incontinence underwent two 24-hour home pad weighing tests. In the patients the test result was compared with the result obtained with the 1-hour ward pad weighing test. Median pad weight gain was 4 g/24-h, with an upper 99% limit of 8 g/24 h in normal women. The median urine loss was 17 g/24-h in the patients. Eighteen (58%) patients were classified as incontinent according to the result of the 1-h ward test, versus 28 (90%) according to the result of the 24-h home test. There was no significant correlation between the result of the 1-h test and the 24-h test. In the patients, test-retest analysis showed a significant variation in the result of the 24-h test. It is concluded that the better of two 24-h home tests is more sensitive for confirmation incontinence than is one 1-h ward test. Consequently, the 24-h home test is of practical use as a screening test for incontinence. The reproducibility of the test, however, seems insufficiently satisfactory to allow of its use in comparative scientific studies."

The NPC cell line was found to be heterogeneous in terms of sensitivity to these anticancer drugs. Therapeutic efficacies of selected drugs could be increased by either increasing the drug concentration or the time of exposure of cells to drugs. Short duration of hyperthermia alone was also effective in inhibiting cell growth. Combined hyperthermia and actinomycin D or vincristine sulfate are markedly cytotoxic for the NPC cells in vitro."

Sephadex LH-20 column chromatographic separation of extracts from these tissues showed that, in placental and molar tissue, 85 to 95% of the extracts were progesterone and very small amounts of 20 alpha-dihydroprogesterone and 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone. The concentration of progesterone in the placenta were 368.8 and 317.2 ng/g tissue, respectively, while in molar tissue the concentration were 2474.5, 1974.6, and 4146.0 ng/g tissue, respectively. Progesterone concentration in ovarian tissue was between 1121;2 and 1440.9 ng/g tissue. It is suggested that the high concentration of progesterone in molar tissue reflects functional capacity of the abnormal trophoblast in progesterone synthesis and accumulation of progesterone due to absence of a fetus. The lower concentration of progesterone in the ovary in molar pregnancy would appear to suggest that the ovary is a secondary source of progesterone in molar pregnancy."

        "abstract": "Acute respiratory acidosis results in increases in cardiac output and in systemic and pulmonary arterial blood pressures. The aim of this investigation was to determine if isoflurane modifies these effects. Nine patients (ASA II or III) scheduled for major surgery took part in the investigation. After the induction of general anesthesia, CO2 was added to the inspiratory gas mixture. After 15 min, ventilation with addition of CO2 (PaCO2 8-9 kPa) isoflurane (3%) was added. Hemodynamic measurements were made to study the effects of acute hypercapnia and the effects of isoflurane during hypercapnia. The addition of carbon dioxide resulted in increases in cardiac output, systemic and pulmonary arterial blood pressures, and right and left ventricular stroke work. The addition of isoflurane during hypercapnia decreased systemic arterial blood pressure, but pulmonary arterial blood pressure was unaffected, cardiac output and stroke volume did not change, and left but not right ventricular stroke work decreased. In conclusion, acute pulmonary hypertension induced by hypercapnia was not affected by isoflurane but, despite increased right ventricular stroke work, there were no signs of right ventricular failure."

        "abstract": "A new formulation of mometasone furoate (MF) for administration by dry powder inhaler (DPI) was evaluated for the treatment of asthma. A 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose-ranging study compared the efficacy and safety of three doses of MF DPI (100, 200 and 400 mcg b.i.d) with beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) 168 mcg b.i.d. administered by metered dose inhaler in 365 adult or adolescent patients being treated with inhaled glucocorticoids. The mean change from baseline to endpoint (last treatment visit) for forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1) was the primary efficacy variable. Secondary efficacy variables included other objective measures of pulmonary function [forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory flow 25-75% (FEV25-75%.) and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR)] as well as subjective measures of therapeutic response (patients' daily evaluation of asthma symptoms and physicians' evaluation). At endpoint, all four active treatments were significantly more effective than placebo (P < 0.01) in improving FEV1 (MF DPI 5 to 7%, BDP 3%, placebo -6.6%) and all other measures of pulmonary function (FVC: MF DPI 4 to 5%, BDP 2%, placebo -4.7%; FEF25-75%: MF DPI 6 to 18%, BDP 7.5%, placebo -9.5%; PEFR (AM): MF DPI 5 to 10%, BDP 5.7%, placebo -7%). A consistent trend was observed for better improvement in patients treated with MF DPI 200 mcg b.i.d. than with MF DPI 100 mcg b.i.d., with no apparent additional benefit of MF DPI 400 mcg b.i.d. Results for the MF DPI 100 mcg b.i.d. and BDP 168 mcg b.i.d. treatment groups were similar. Patients' and physicians' subjective evaluations of symptoms found similar improvement in the MF DPI 200 and 400 mcg b.i.d. treatment groups, which were slightly better than that in the MF DPI 100 mcg b.i.d. group. Symptoms tended to worsen in the placebo group. MF DPI was well tolerated at all dose levels and the most frequently reported treatment-related adverse effects were headache, pharyngitis and oral candidiasis. No evidence of HPA-axis suppression was detected in any treatment group. In summary, all doses of MF DPI were well tolerated and significantly improved lung function and MF DPI 400 mcg (200 mcg b.i.d.) was the optimal dose in this study of patients with moderate persistent asthma."

Also, these procedures allowed to avoid enucleation in stage I retinoblastoma and bilateral tumors. Optimal schemes of chemotherapy for retinoblastoma and sarcomas of the orbit at different stages were developed. Prophylactic chemotherapy is required within the first 18-24 months."

        "abstract": "The biological activity of 14 analogues of sparsomycin (1) was studied in cell-free systems of Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Sulfolobus solfataricus by measuring the inhibition of protein synthesis. The inhibition of L1210 colony formation in soft agar and bacterial cell growth in solid as well as in liquid medium was also examined. Each analogue possesses not more than two structural modifications of the sparsomycin molecule. This enabled us to determine unambiguously several structural and stereochemical features that are required for an optimal biological activity in these assays. Sparsomycin, having the SCRS chirality, is the most potent of the four possible stereoisomers. The results obtained with compounds 5-7 indicate that the presence of an oxygen atom on the S (alpha) atom is essential. Substitution of the bivalent sulfur atom by a CH2 group (10) or of the SCH3 moiety by a Cl atom (12) affects the activity of the molecule partially. Compound 12 is surprisingly active against intact cells. Substitution of the C(6)-CH3 group by a H(14) reduces the activity of the molecule. Isomerization of the trans double bond into the cis double bond yields cis-sparsomycin (15), which is inactive. The hydrophobic derivatives 8, 9, and 11 are considerably more active than sparsomycin; thus the ribosomal binding site for sparsomycin may have a hydrophobic character."

        "abstract": "Medical devices include thousands of products, many of which have greatly contributed to the quality of health care. As devices have proliferated, so have public policies that affect them. The federal government intervened to promote three fundamental values: safety by federal regulation, innovation through federal funding of research and development, and access by providing services under Medicare. The policies generally coexisted without conflict. However, two recent developments--the advent of cost containment and the expansion of the tort liability system--present a potentially disruptive influence on these policies, and threaten to undermine the values they serve. Because cost restraints are inevitable and the tort system provides consumer protection, the challenge for policymakers is to reconcile them with the values of safety, innovation, and access. The proposals presented here seek to promote coordination to protect those values without imposing unacceptable costs on the health care system."

Newly emerged females decapitated prior to scotophase produced no or very little pheromone 24 h later. However, injection of PBAN or Br-SEG homogenates, obtained from donors of the same or the other species, stimulated pheromone production to normal levels. Transection of the ventral nerve cord (VNC) or extirpation of the terminal abdominal ganglion (TAG) did not affect pheromone production in control females. Similarly, injections of PBAN or Br-SEG homogenates into decapitated females reactivated pheromone production to normal levels, whether or not the VNC was intact or the TAG present. Furthermore, octopamine was not effective in stimulating pheromone production in decapitated females. Taken together, these results indicate that the regulation of pheromone production is not neurally mediated in either Choristoneura species. However, there was no evidence that hemolymph collected from pheromone-producing females contained pheromonotropic activity. Similarly, isolated glands incubated with PBAN did not produce pheromone. The presence of the bursa copulatrix was required to produce pheromone in both tortricids as production was not restored in decapitated bursa-less females injected with PBAN or a Br-SEG homogenate. However, an extract of the bursa copulatrix did not elicit pheromonotropic activity in decapitated females or incubated glands of either species. The bursa copulatrix is only involved in pheromone production of some species of tortricids but our results do not support the current explanation for such interspecific differences. We postulate that the relative importance of a bursa factor may be related to the evolution of different desaturation systems used for pheromone biosynthesis in the Tortricidae. Arch."

        "abstract": "The structural differences between trypanothione reductase of Trypanosoma cruzi and human glutathione reductase, an enzyme of known three-dimensional structure, offer an opportunity for rational drug design against Chagas' disease. As a first step in the analysis of the parasite enzyme we report its purification and characterization. 2.2 mg trypanothione reductase was extracted from 33 g wet weight of cultured epimastigotes or from 4 g lyophilized cells. The flavoenzyme was purified 2400-fold to homogeneity in three steps with an overall yield of 45%. The enzyme is a dimer with a subunit Mr of 50,000. Using NADPH (Km = 5 microM) and trypanothione disulfide (Km = 45 microM) as substrates, a turnover number of 14,200 min-1 was estimated. Trypanothione reductase, the parasite enzyme, and glutathione reductase, the host enzyme, exhibit mutually exclusive specificities for their respective disulfide substrates. When screening cell cultures or column eluates for the presence of trypanothione reductase, a microassay based on Ellman's reagent as indicator was used. A mixture of regioisomeric glutathionylspermidine disulfides isolated from Escherichia coli served as substrate in this microassay. Experimentally, the catalytic cycle of the enzyme can be subdivided into the half-reactions Eox + NADPH + H+----EH2 + NADP+, and EH2 + trypanothione disulfide----Eox + dihydrotrypanothione. This is also true for the crystallized enzyme in the presence of 2 M (NH4)2SO4. The spectral properties of trypanothione reductase both in the oxidized form (Eox) and in the two-electron-reduced form (EH2) closely resemble those of human glutathione reductase. Both proteins contain a flavin and a redox-active disulfide at the catalytic site. After reduction of Eox to EH2, trypanothione reductase can be inactivated by specifically alkylating one of the nascent active-site thiols."

        "abstract": "The present study was conducted to evaluate the influence of a hepatic portal infusion of hypertonic saline on the metabolic and hormonal responses to exercise. Adrenodemedullated male rats were studied at rest or after 30 min of treadmill exercise (26 m/min, 0% grade). Three groups of rats were infused continuously at a rate of 52 microL/min with one of the following randomly assigned conditions: hypertonic 3.6% NaCl (P3.6% NaCl) or 1.8% NaCl (P1.8% NaCl) infused into the hepatic portal vein, and hypertonic 3.6% NaCl (J3.6% NaCl) infused into the jugular vein. One group of rats received no infusion (SHAM). The infusions of hypertonic NaCl into the portal or the jugular site resulted in a significant (p < 0.05) increase in peripheral concentration of Na+, Cl-, and osmolality at rest and after exercise. The antidiuretic hormone (ADH) concentration was significantly (p < 0.05) increased by the P3.6% NaCl and J3.6% NaCl infusions at rest and after exercise. Exercise caused a significant (p < 0.05). decrease in liver glycogen content, peripheral and portal plasma glycemia, and insulinemia regardless of the different types and sites of infusions. However, the peripheral glucagon response to exercise was significantly (p < 0.05) increased only when hypertonic saline (1.8 or 3.6%) was infused into the portal vein. Portal and peripheral lactate concentrations at rest and after exercise were significantly (p < 0.01) higher in P3.6% NaCl than in all other groups. It is concluded that a 30-min hypertonic saline infusion into the hepatic portal vein does not specifically influence the insulin response at rest and after exercise, but that glucagon response to exercise is increased by such an infusion."

        "abstract": "The present paper is concerned with Schachter's theory of emotion and with experiments evaluating its empirical significance. Three studies are examined, those by Schachter a. Singer (1962), Erdmann a. Janke (1978) and Marschall a. Zimbardo (1979). They differ considerably in their results. The view is taken, that the seemingly inconsistent findings could be related to a common denominator, with no immediate need of abandoning Schachter's basic ideas. In addressing this issue the concept of \"cognitive-physiological incongruity\" is introduced referring to altered relations between a person's bodily reactions and his cognitions. An attempt is made to show, that cognitive-physiological incongruity, assumed to be present in the experimental studies under consideration, accounts for most of their conflicting results."

Anti-VCA and anti-EA titers were found significantly associated with NPC. The relative risk increased with the increase of antibody titers. Individuals who smoked 30 or more cigarettes per day had more than 3.4 times higher risk than those who never smoked, while no increase in the risk was observed for those smoking less than 20 cigarettes per day and ex-smokers. Use of herb drugs, working under poor ventilation and nativity were also found to increase the NPC risk. In cases other than smoking 20 or more cigarettes per day and the frequent use of herb drugs, the synergistic interaction was not observed. In addition, male NPC individuals and Mainland Chinese were found to have relatively lower antibody titers as compared with female individuals or native Taiwanese."

Fifty one strains of P. cocovenenans subsp. farinofermentans isolated from some areas of China were divided into 20 ribotyes, 52.9 percent of which were RT6, 9 and 2. In most cases, there were 2 or more ribotypes in each province or city. Though same ribotypes were isolated from different provinces, each ribotype existed in part of an area. The ribotype of RT6 was detected in samples from 4 incidents of food poisoning in Guizhou, Jiangsu and Hebei provinces, which indicated that these incidents may be caused by the same clone. With discrimination and cluster analysis of ribotypes, the rDNA fingerprinting may effectively contribute to analyzing the homogeneity of different strains, tracing the transmission route, and exploring the evolution and epidemiological characteristics of P. cocovenenans subsp. farinofermentans."

        "abstract": "When rats were subjected to the stress of burns, tumors, or partial hepatectomy, a notable new peak of glucocorticoid binding protein appeared on DEAE-cellulose chromatography. This peak accompanied the original peak, which was the only dominant peak in intact rats. The appearance of the new binding protein was concomitant with a high rise in serum corticosterone levels. The new peak was eluted with 0.12-0.14 M NaCl and another, small new peak with 0.02-0.03 M NaCl, while the original peak of intact rats was eluted with 0.05-0.08 M NaCl. In rats adrenalectomized prior to the stress, the new peaks did not appear. To mimic these stressful conditions which provoked a burst of endogenous glucocorticoid, rats were administered with an exogenous high dose of dexamethasone (100 micrograms/100 g B.W.) in vivo. The new peak eluted with 0.12-0.14 M NaCl was again observed and was more dominant in the hormone-treated rats than the stressed rats. These three peaks eluted with 0.02-0.03 M, 0.05-0.08 M, and 0.12-0.14 M NaCl are called here Peak A, B, and C, respectively. This is the first demonstration of the effect of physiological changes in serum levels of glucocorticoid hormone on the nature of glucocorticoid binding protein by DEAE-cellulose chromatography."

        "abstract": "Two new fluorescent nucleotide photoaffinity labels, 3'(2')-O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl)-1,N6-ethenoadenosine 5'-diphosphate (Bz2 epsilon ADP) and 2'-deoxy-3'-O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl)-1,N6-ethenoadenosine 5'-diphosphate [3'(Bz2)2'd epsilon ADP], have been synthesized and used as probes of the ATP binding site of myosin subfragment 1 (SF1). These analogues are stably trapped by the bifunctional thiol cross-linker N,N'-p-phenylenedimaleimide (pPDM) at the active site in a manner similar to that of ATP [Wells, J.A., & Yount, R.G. (1979) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 76, 4966-4970], and nonspecific photolabeling can be minimized by removing free probe by gel filtration prior to irradiation. Both probes covalently photoincorporate with high efficiency (40-50%) into the central 50-kDa heavy chain tryptic peptide, as found previously for the nonfluorescent parent compound 3'(2')-O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl)adenosine diphosphate [Mahmood, R., & Yount, R.G. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 12956-12959]. The solution conformations of Bz2 epsilon ADP and 3'(Bz2)-2'd epsilon ADP were analyzed by steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy. These data indicated that the benzoylbenzoyl rings in both analogues were stacked over the epsilon-adenine ring. The degree of stacking was greater with the 2' isomer than with the 3' isomer. Fluorescence quantum yields and lifetimes were measured for Bz2 epsilon ADP and 3'(Bz2)2'd epsilon ADP reversibly bound, stably trapped, and covalently photoincorporated at the active site of SF1. These values were compared with those for 3'(2')-O-[[(phenylhydroxymethyl)phenyl]carbonyl]-1,N6-ethenoadenos ine diphosphate (CBH epsilon ADP) and 2'-deoxy-3'-O-[[(phenylhydroxymethyl)phenyl]carbonyl]-1,N6- ethenoadenosine diphosphate [3'(CBH)2'd epsilon ADP]. These derivatives were synthesized as fluorescent analogues of the expected product of the photochemical reactions of Bz2 epsilon ADP and 3'(Bz2)2'd epsilon ADP, respectively, with the active site of SF1. The fluorescence properties of the carboxybenzhydrol derivatives trapped at the active site by pPDM were compared with those of the Bz2 nucleotide-SF1 complexes. These properties were consistent with a photoincorporation mechanism in which the carbonyl of benzophenone was converted to a tertiary alcohol attached covalently to the protein. The specific, highly efficient photoincorporation of Bz2 epsilon ADP at the active site will allow it to be used as a donor in distance measurements by fluorescence resonance energy transfer to acceptor sites on actin."

        "abstract": "Sixteen characterized alcohol dehydrogenases and one sorbitol dehydrogenase have been aligned. The proteins represent two formally different enzyme activities (EC 1.1.1.1 and EC 1.1.1.14), three different types of molecule (dimeric alcohol dehydrogenase, tetrameric alcohol dehydrogenase, tetrameric sorbitol dehydrogenase), metalloproteins with different zinc contents (1 or 2 atoms per subunit), and polypeptide chains from different kingdoms and orders (mammals, higher plants, fungus, yeasts). Present comparisons utilizing all 17 forms reveal extensive variations in alcohol dehydrogenase, but with evolutionary changes that are of the same order in different branches and at different times. They emphasize the general importance of particular residues, suggesting related overall functional constraints in the molecules. The comparisons also define a few coincidences between intron positions in the genes and gap positions in the gene products. Only 22 residues are strictly conserved; half of these are Gly, and most of the remaining ones are Pro or acidic residues. No basic residue, no straight-chain hydrophobic residues, no aromatic residues, and essentially no branched-chain or polar neutral residues are invariable. Tentative consensus sequences were calculated, defining 13 additional residues likely to be typical of but not invariant among the alcohol dehydrogenases. These show a predominance of Val, charged residues, and Gly. Combined, the comparisons, which are particularly relevant to the data base for protein engineering, illustrate the requirements for functionally important binding interactions, and the extent of space restrictions in proteins with related overall conformations and functions."

        "article_title": "Muscarinic cholinergic receptors in human foetal brain: characterization and ontogeny of [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate binding sites in frontal cortex.",
        "abstract": "Twenty-two frontal cortices from normal human foetal brains of gestational ages ranging from 16 to 40 weeks and five postnatal brains ranging from 5 to 50 years were analysed for the ontogeny of muscarinic receptors using [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB) as the ligand. QNB binding sites were shown to be stable up to 4 1/2 months of storage at -70 degrees C. QNB binding was characterized in frontal cortices of 28-week-old foetal brains as muscarinic receptors by the following criteria: (1) it was localised mainly in particulate fraction; (2) binding was saturable at a concentration of 1.5 nM; (3) the cholinergic antagonists atropine and scopolamine competed for the binding, with IC50 values of 1 and 0.8 nM, respectively. The agonists oxotremorine, carbachol, and pilocarpine gave IC50 values of 1, 15 and 18 microM, respectively. Nicotinic receptor ligands and noncholinergic drugs could not compete for the binding. Bimolecular association and dissociation rate constants for the reversible binding are 6.23 X 10(8) M-1 X min-1 and 2.0 X 10(-2) X min-1, respectively. The equilibrium dissociation constant is 33 pM. The KD obtained by saturation binding data is 103 pM. Ontogeny of muscarinic receptors showed three distinct phases: In phase I, they appear between 16 and 18 weeks [average concentration 109 fmol/mg protein of total particulate fraction (TPF)] and slowly increase up to 20 weeks (average concentration 147 fmol/mg protein TPF). Phase II is a lag period between 20 and 24 weeks at which time receptor concentration does not change perceptibly (average concentration (67 fmol/mg protein TPF).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Neoplasms in stomach, medium and posterior intestine mainly in distal parts of these organs were found. Histologically the tumours are benign adenomatous polyps, differentiated adenocarcinomas, poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas, and poorly differentiated or entirely anaplastic adenocarcinomas. The last two types of tumours produced metastases into pancreas, pyloric caeca, and the liver. Virological investigations failed to confirm the presence of any oncoviral particles in these tumours. Aflatoxin analysis of fish foodstuffs gave negative results."

        "abstract": "Twenty rats were poisoned by manganese inhalation, and sacrificed six months after the first exposure. The tissue concentrations (in microgram/g dry weight) of manganese and iron were found in liver, pancreas, lung, kidney and suprarenal gland for atomic absorption spectrometry in control and experimental animals. The measurements show high tissue concentrations of manganese, especially in liver and pancreas of the experimental animals, as well as a little increase in the tissue concentrations of iron, fundamentally in liver, kidney and suprarenal gland."

        "abstract": "To induce graft-versus-host reaction (GVHR), C57B1/6 (B6) spleen cells were injected into (B6 x bm1)F1, (B6 x bm12)F1, and (bm1 x bm12)F1 mice. Since the strains bm1 and bm12 are mutant at the H-2Kb and I-Ab regions of major histocompatibility complex (MHC), respectively, we can assess MHC class I- or class II-different GVHR. As reported earlier, immunological perturbations assessed by the number of immunoglobulin-producing cells and immune complex deposition in renal glomeruli were demonstrated in MHC class II-different GVHR. A conspicuous finding in this report is that epithelioid granuloma formation was observed in the portal area and around the central vein of liver of (B6 x bm12)F1 mice injected with B6 spleen cells. The epithelioid granuloma formation was not observed in (B6 x bm1)F1 nor (bm1 x bm12)F1 recipient mice. Degenerative changes resembling chronic nonsuppurative destructive cholangitis in primary biliary cirrhosis were also observed in the bile duct epithelium in (B6 x bm12)F1 and (bm1 x bm12)F1 mice. These lesions were already obvious at the 2 week postinjection of donor cells and were continuously observed up to 10 weeks when immunological perturbations subsided. Thus, class II-disparate GVHR in this experimental system might provide a novel animal model of protracted disease, primary biliary cirrhosis."

        "abstract": "Graft-versus-host reaction (GVH) after allogeneic spleen cell transplantation was completely suppressed in an H-2-matched murine combination (AKR/J Sea [H-2k]----lethally irradiated C3H/He Slc [H-2k]) by pretreatment of the donors with recipient spleen cell antigen plus cyclophosphamide (CP). Irradiated recipients receiving cells became chimeric. In contrast to the H-2 matched combination, lethal GVH reaction could not be prevented in an H-2-mismatched fully allogeneic combination (C57BL/6 Cr Slc [H-2b]----lethally irradiated C3H/He Slc [H-2k]) by pretreatment of the donors. The results suggest that the effectors responsible for the GVH reaction were abrogated by pretreatment of the donors with allogeneic recipient spleen cells plus CP in the H-2-matched combination, but donor pretreatment failed to abrogate GVH reaction in the H-2-mismatched combination."

        "abstract": "A natural surfactant with low protein content (1%) was prepared by a sequence of cold centrifugation, heating to 90 degrees C, sucrose-gradient centrifugation, and extraction with chloroform:methanol. Some of the material was enriched with dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and unsaturated phosphatidylglycerol (PG) to relative concentrations of 56% and 10%, respectively. The in vitro physical properties of these preparations were evaluated with pulsating bubble and Wilhelmy balance and their in vivo activity with experiments on artificially ventilated premature newborn rabbits, delivered on day 27 of gestation. The animals were kept in body plethysmographs at 37 degrees C and ventilated artificially with a standardized sequence of insufflation pressures: 25, 20, and 15 cm H2O. The lungs were fixed by vascular perfusion and the alveolar expansion evaluated morphometrically in histologic sections. Enrichment of surfactant with DPPC and PG resulted in lower minimal surface tension during surface compression but did not further improve lung compliance or the alveolar expansion pattern. Treatment with nonenriched surfactant at a phospholipid concentration of 100 mg/ml (individual dose = 200 mg/kg) caused a markedly increased lung compliance at all insufflation pressure levels (p vs. controls less than .01). Our data indicate that pulmonary surfactant remains physiologically active after removal of most of its protein components and that enrichment with DPPC and PG reduces the in vitro minimal surface tension without adding to the in vivo efficacy."

The background rhythmic burst activity was undistinguishable in both states. Low-frequency electric stimulation of afferent inputs (MFB, CA1, LS) led to entrainment of the theta-cycles. The upper limit of following was almost normal in the undercut septum, but was strongly reduced under pentobarbital. In units with the driving \"by pause\", the duration of the initial silent period under pentobarbital was increased almost twofold but in the basally undercut septum it was the same as in the normal state. Some MS-DB units with weak or absent theta-modulation reacted to stimulation by stimulus-locked single spike discharges which followed up to high frequencies in both conditions."

        "abstract": "The reactivities of brevetoxin compounds in acid and base and under oxidizing conditions were studied using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) to monitor reaction products. Brevetoxins are determined to be unstable in acidic and basic solutions. Under acidic conditions, brevetoxins containing an aldehyde functional group in the terminal \"tail\" side chain are easily converted to acetal structures, while \"head\" side lactone ring opening proceeds more slowly. Measurement of reaction rate constants indicates the following order of reactivity under acidic conditions: Btx-1 > Btx-2 > Btx-9. Under basic conditions, hydroxide ion attack at the head portion leads to lactone ring opening. Base hydrolysis (0.01 N NaOH in 50:50 methanol/water) goes to completion in 120 min for Btx-2 and Btx-9, but Btx-1 did not react to completion. Both acid and base hydrolyses can lead to reversible lactone ring opening, but base hydrolysis proceeds faster than acid hydrolysis under comparable conditions. Acid treatment is not an effective method for detoxifying brevetoxins. Base treatment can open the lactone ring (type B brevetoxins proceed faster than type A brevetoxins), leading to a product that is reportedly nontoxic, but the reaction is reversible. Brevetoxins are shown to be readily oxidized by permanganate in an irreversible and relatively fast reaction, likely through addition to double bonds followed by bond cleavage, suggesting that it is a viable method for detoxification."

        "abstract": "Of the several facets of technique that must be addressed to allow the generation of highly accurate results by gas chromatographic analysis of fatty acid methyl esters, that of split injection to capillary columns has long been a major problem. A practical solution of this problem is now proposed. Three factors were found to be of major importance in achieving highly accurate results viz. avoidance of needle discrimination when injecting, very rapid vaporisation of the sample and complete homogenisation of the sample with the carrier gas stream. High speed of injection was found to be a highly effective means of avoiding needle discrimination. Rapid vaporisation of the sample was achieved by the use of relatively dilute solutions of analyte in the solvent, the smallest sample size commensurate with obtaining a chromatogram that could be accurately quantitated and, particularly, by the use of injector temperatures considerably higher than those generally adopted. Good mixing of the vaporized sample with the carrier gas was achieved with a number of injector insert designs, but, with improvement of design, it was found possible to achieve linear splitting over a wide range of operating conditions. The most controversial recommendation is to use very high injection temperatures, but it has been shown that the commonly held view that this may cause pyrolysis of fatty acid methyl esters is not true, even when the esters are highly unsaturated."

The diffusion model seemed to be the more satisfactory model in respect to both description and prediction of the drug uptake for all conditions. The compartment model appeared to be useful for describing the drug uptake at earlier times, giving a satisfactory fit to the data and reliable final parameter estimates. However, that model was not able to describe the loss as equilibrium was approached or accurately predict the disappearance profiles for these solutes with alterations in solution volume or infusion bag size. Approximations of the diffusion model gave parameter estimates consistent with those obtained by nonlinear regression using the full equations."

        "abstract": "The large apical segments of guinea pig sperm acrosomes were mechanically separated from the spermatozoa and subsequently isolated by density gradient centrifugation. The isolated acrosomal caps were very stable and maintained their crescent morphology when suspended in sucrose-based medium buffered at pH 5.6, with or without the acrosin inhibitor p-aminobenzamidine (pAB). Examination under the electron microscope showed that the acrosomal caps were free of plasma membrane and were bound by an outer acrosomal membrane which was discontinuous. Enzymatic analysis after lysis of the caps indicated that acrosin and hyaluronidase were present with high specific activity, while only a trace amount of acid phosphatase activity and no arylsulphatase, phospholipase A2, or phospholipase C activities were present. Significant particulate acrosin activity, but only trace amounts of soluble acrosin activity, could be detected in the isolated acrosomal caps if assayed immediately after isolation in the absence of pAB. However, soluble acrosin activity of high specific activity was obtained after the acrosomal caps were extracted by 10% glycerol buffered at low pH (pH 3.0). The new procedures provide a means to isolate and purify guinea pig sperm apical acrosomal segments rapidly."

        "article_title": "[Statistical evaluation of chronic granulomatous disease in Japan and basic studies for gene therapy for CGD patients].",
        "abstract": "Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is an inherited immune deficiency caused by mutations in any of the following four phox genes encoding subunits of the superoxide generating phagocyte NADPH oxidase. It consists of membranous cytochrome b558 composed of gp91-phox and p22-phox, and four cytosolic components, p47-phox, p67-phox, rac p21 and p40-phox, which translocate to the membrane upon activation. In our group study, more than 220 CGD patients has been enrolled. The incidence of CGD patients was estimated as 1 out of 250,000 births. The expected life span of the CGD patients is 25 to 30 years old by the Kaplan Meier analysis. Comparing with the ratio of CGD subtype in US and Europe, that with p47-phox deficiency is lower (less than 10% vs. 23%) and that of gp91-phox deficiency is higher (more than 75% vs. 60%). Prophylactic administration of ST antibiotics and IFN-gamma and bone marrow transplantation have been successfully employed in our therapeutic strategy. However, it is necessary to develop the gene therapy technology for CGD patients as more promising treatment. In the current study we constructed two retrovirus vectors; MFGS-gp91/293 SPA which contains only the therapeutic gp91-phox gene, a bicistronic retrovims pHa-MDR-IRES-gp91/PA317 which carries a multi drug resistant gene (MDR1) and the gp91-phox gene connected with an internal ribosome entry site (IRES). We demonstrate high efficiency transduction of gp91-phox to CGD EB virus established cell line with high levels of functional correction of the oxidase by MFGS-gp91 and by pHa-MDR-IRES-gp91, respectively. We also demonstrate sufficient transduction of gp91-phox to CD34+ haematopoietic stem cell from the patients with gp91-phox deficiency by MFGS-gp91/293 SPA. Our current studies suggest that the combination of the 293-SPA packaging system and the bicistronic retrovirus system inserted MDR1 gene make our CGD gene therapy more feasible for clinical application."

        "abstract": "The incidence of breast cancer is higher for black women aged less than 40 years than for white women aged less than 40; however, both black and white women aged less than 35 years have the lowest breast cancer survival rates of all age groups. The issue of breast self-examination (BSE) efficacy has special implications for these women because the BSE and the clinical breast examination (CBE) are the only early detection techniques recommended to them. Breast self-examination is even more important for black women because CBE might not be accessible to them for economic or other reasons.Studies relating BSE practice to tumor stage were reviewed. Most of the evidence was favorable, although it was not obtained with the most scientific methodologic approach. The negative evidence, on the other hand, came from studies with additional methodologic and conceptual problems, and should have little impact when evaluating BSE efficacy.Competence of performance has been shown to affect the efficacy of the self-examination. Most studies on BSE value, however, did not assess the examiner's competence. Because data obtained elsewhere show that most women performing BSE do not perform it competently, the significance of the positive evidence on BSE value is heightened. Most breast tumors are self-discovered, and encouraging competent BSE performance will give more women better means to discover tumors earlier."

Ivermectin and oxfendazole given orally were similarly effective, whereas ivermectin given by subcutaneous injection extended the period of suppressed egg output by about one week. The more persistent anthelmintic effect of ivermectin given subcutaneously was probably due to its extended half-life in the plasma of treated sheep. Plasma pepsinogen activity was less in the sheep given anthelmintic than in the untreated controls. Ivermectin caused a significantly greater reduction in pepsinogen activity than oxfendazole and was more effective when given subcutaneously than when given orally."

        "abstract": "Subcellular fractionation of rat sciatic nerve was developed to determine the specific localization of gangliosides in the nerve membrane fractions. Myelin, microsomal, and a plasma membrane-like fraction were isolated and purified by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. These subfractions were characterized by electron microscopy, marker enzyme assays, and their protein and lipid profile. In rat sciatic nerve myelin, 90 mol% of the total gangliosides were monosialogangliosides. LM1 (sialosyl-lactoneotetraosylceramide) (61 mol%) and GM3 (21%) were the major gangliosides of the rat nerve myelin. Two other neolacto series of gangliosides, viz., sialosyl-lactoneonorhexaosylceramide and sialosyl-lactoneooctaosylceramide, were also localized mostly in the myelin fraction. GM1 was only a minor (less than 2%) ganglioside in myelin. The ganglioside patterns of the microsomal and plasma membrane-like fractions were similar with minor quantitative differences and were entirely different from that of myelin. Monosialogangliosides were approximately 70-75 mol% of the total in these fractions. The major gangliosides of the microsomal and plasma membrane-like fractions were GM3 (approximately 40%) and GM1 (approximately 20%). LM1 in these fractions was minimal (less than approximately 5%). Significant amounts of GM3 with N-glycolylneuraminic acid (approximately 10%) and GM1b (4-14%) were also identified in the microsomal and plasma membrane-like fractions but not in myelin. These and the higher lactoneo series of gangliosides have not been previously reported to be present in the rat nervous system. Almost exclusive localization of LM1 in myelin in rat peripheral nervous system is consistent with our previous observation that deposition of LM1 in the nerve with age was very similar to that of myelin marker lipids cerebrosides and sulfatides."

        "abstract": "This study was designed to determine gastric alkaline secretion (GAS) and duodenal alkaline secretion (DAS) and their relation to the duodenal motility pattern in conscious dogs under basal conditions and after vagal stimulation by sham-feeding and insulin hypoglycaemia. GAS was measured in the gastric perfusate and DAS was determined in the perfusate of the upper duodenum (7 cm in length between occluding balloons). Resting GAS and DAS showed typical periodicity in phase with myoelectric and motor activity, reaching peaks during phases II and III, respectively, and nadir during phase I of the migrating motor cycle (MMC). Vagal excitation by sham-feeding or insulin hypoglycaemia resulted in an immediate rise in GAS and DAS, accompanied by a suppression of MMC. Atropine (25 micrograms/kg) reduced basal GAS and DAS by about 50% and abolished GAS but not DAS in response to vagal stimulation, being accompanied by complete suppression of MMC for several hours. Following injection of indomethacin (2.5 mg/kg) to suppress the generation of endogenous prostaglandins, a prolonged reduction in basal GAS and DAS and an increase in the myoelectric activity and the disruption of the MMC occurred. Neither GAS nor DAS responses to vagal stimulation were affected by indomethacin. We conclude that resting GAS and DAS fluctuate cyclically in phase with gastroduodenal motor activity, and that vagal excitation results in a potent stimulation of alkaline secretion and myoelectric activity which are, in part, cholinergic and do not depend upon the generation of endogenous prostaglandins."

        "abstract": "This study was carried out primarily to determine whether the feeding of lecithin (polyenylphosphatidylcholine) has systemic effects on metabolism of cholesterol and triglycerides in patients with endogenous hypertriglyceridemia (type 4 hyperlipoproteinemia). Ten patients were studied during control periods and lecithin feeding. In the former period, 7 g of safflower oil were added to the diet to balance the addition of 10 g of lecithin in the latter period. Lecithin feeding had no influence on levels of plasma cholesterol and triglycerides, or lipoprotein-cholesterol, transport of VLDL-triglycerides, or total steroid balance. However, lecithin feeding did significantly increase the molar percent of bile acids and decrease the molar percent lecithin in gallbladder bile suggesting that it has a systemic effect. In addition, it had a small but significant inhibitory effect on intestinal absorption of cholesterol."

        "abstract": "The antineoplastic and toxic effects of mitomycin (MC) administered as a single pulse injection were compared with the effects of MC given as infusions over 2, 5, or 24 hours and with the effects of the drug administered in fractionated regimens incorporating 2-20 injections. The antineoplastic effects of MC were assessed using EMT6 mouse mammary tumors implanted in BALB/c mice; tumor response was assessed using both cell survival and tumor growth assays. The host toxicity of MC was assessed by measuring the survival of bone marrow stem cells (CFU-S) and by determining LD50/30's (which reflect primarily marrow injury). The survival curve for cells from tumors treated with varying doses of MC was exponential, with no shoulder which might suggest accumulation of sublethal lesions. No evidence was found that the tumor cells repaired MC damage when left in situ for up to 24 hours after treatment (repair of potentially lethal damage) or that the tumor repaired sublethal damage during times of up to 24 hours between drug treatments or during drug infusions. The responses of tumors treated with single injections of MC, with infusions over 2, 5, and 24 hours, with two injections separated by 5 or 24 hours, and with five daily injections were all similar. The survival curve for CFU-S from mice treated with varying doses of MC was exponential, with no shoulder which might suggest accumulation of sublethal lesions. LD50/30's were the same whether MC was administered as single injections, as infusions over 2, 5 or 24 hours, or as five daily fractions. Longer fractionated regimens, in which mice received daily injections, 5 days per week, for up to 4 weeks, produced less host toxicity but also less antineoplastic effect; the therapeutic ratio for the most protracted regimen tested was lower than that for single injections. The therapeutic ratios achieved with infusions and fractionated regimens were never greater than that obtained with a large single dose, confirming clinical impressions that infrequent, large doses of MC are an optimal method of treatment with this drug."

        "abstract": "From 1946 to 1971, diethylstilbestrol, a nonsteroid synthetic estrogen, came in for widespread use in the USA, and in other countries only occasional use, for the treatment of high-risk pregnancies. In 1971 a retrospective epidemiologic study showed a close association of this therapy with occurrence of vaginal and cervical adenocarcinoma in young women (mean age 19 years). Up to 1981 63% of 429 clear cell carcinomas of the vagina and cervix were related to DES exposure in utero in the USA. Following reports on a few cases in other countries, the present report is the first in a Swiss female, aged 23, with stage III DES-induced adenocarcinoma of the vagina. The risk of DES-related adenocarcinoma is estimated at about 1%, but benign teratogenic lesions are present in over 50% of patients. Vaginal adenosis is the most frequent finding, but other malformations of vagina (septa), cervix, uterus and fallopian tube may be found. Malformations of the genital tract have also been described in DES-exposed male offspring."

        "abstract": "The treatment of the patients with ruptured cerebral aneurysm in acute stage is performed by direct neck clipping and cisternal drainages for preventing vasospasm. The cisternal drainage is carried out for 1 to 2 weeks' duration. The cisternal drainage has higher risk for bacterial infections in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). In this paper, penetration characteristics of cefotiam (CTM) in CSF were studied. CTM concentrations in CSF were measured at 1, 3 and 6 hours after intravenous drip infusion of CTM (2 g). CTM concentration in cisternal CSF was higher than that of ventricular CSF. The peak concentration in CSF was higher than 0.78 micrograms/ml and obtained at 3 hours after intravenous drip infusion. Our data suggest that CTM is a useful cephalosporin for treatment of meningitis (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae et al.). Apart from meningitis, the higher concentration of CTM in CSF was obtained in the cases with the vasospasm. The result may support that the breakdown of blood brain barrier is induced by the peroxidative substance from the cisternal subarachnoid clots which has the vasospastic activity."

        "abstract": "A wealth of information has been gathered during the past decades that water molecules do play an important role in the structure, dynamics, and function of bacteriorhodopsin (bR) and purple membrane. Light-induced structural alterations in bR as detected by X-ray and neutron diffraction at low and high resolution are discussed in relationship to the mechanism of proton pumping. The analysis of high resolution intermediate structures revealed photon-induced rearrangements of water molecules and hydrogen bonds concomitant with conformational changes in the chromophore and the protein. These observations led to an understanding of key features of the pumping mechanism, especially the vectoriality and the different modes of proton translocation in the proton release and uptake domain of bR. In addition, water molecules influence the function of bR via equilibrium fluctuations, which must occur with adequate amplitude so that energy barriers between conformational states can be overcome."

        "abstract": "Patients with deficient activity of hepatic glucose-6-phosphatase (glycogen storage disease type I [GSD-I]) have fasting-induced hypoglycemia, lactic acidemia, hyperuricemia, hyperlipidemia, and a markedly increased capacity for ethanol elimination. The mechanism(s) responsible for the rapid ethanol elimination is not known but has been thought to be directly related to the enzyme defect. We postulated however, that the increased elimination of ethanol was an adaptive phenomenon that would revert toward normal with correction of other blood abnormalities by long-term maintenance of normal blood glucose concentration. Six patients were observed before treatment (group A), and four of the six were observed again 3 to 6 months after dietary treatment had normalized all blood abnormalities (group B). Patients received 16 ml/m2 absolute ethanol as a 5% solution in 0.9% sodium chloride over a 20-minute period. The rate of ethanol elimination was significantly greater (P less than 0.03) in group A than in group B (55.1 +/- 11.1 vs. 37.5 +/- 8.6 mg/dl/hr). Changes in lactate level after ethanol were also significant between the two groups (P less than 0.005). Group A showed a decrease from 9.4 +/- 0.5 to 6.4 +/- 0.4 mEq/L, whereas group B showed an increase in lactate level from 2.7 +/- 0.2 to 4.4 +/- 0.64 mEq/L. Ethanol induced no significant change in blood glucose concentration in group A, whereas there was a significant increase (P less than 0.03) in group B from 93 +/- 6 to 123 +/- 9 mg/dl.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

All patients underwent neurological, neuropsychological, and biochemical evaluations on the same occasions. Predialysis rCBF values did not differ from those obtained in age-matched normal controls. Following hemodialysis, there was a mild reduction in the rCBF by a mean of 7 +/- 2.6% (p = 0.02). The posthemodialysis rCBF reduction was not associated with any neurological or cognitive dysfunction. The causes of hemodialysis-induced rCBF decreases are unknown, but increased blood viscosity and biochemical changes, such as urea reduction and blood alkalinization, may play a role."

        "abstract": "The survival of antibiotic-resistant enteric bacteria in the effluent treatment plant of a pig farm was studied by quantitative determinations of resistant and sensitive populations at different sites of the effluent purification process. The effluent treatment system, combining storage and aeration tanks, reduced the concentration of enteric organisms in the output of the plant to about one-tenth of the concentration found in the incoming untreated slurry. This reduction occurred mainly at the level of the aerated tank and was observed for the total population of enteric organisms as well as for the various populations resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, kanamycin, streptomycin and tetracycline respectively. Moreover, no particular sequence of resistances seems to have been selected during treatment. Storage and aeration of pig slurry before disposal reduces the risk of dissemination of antibiotic-resistant bacteria of animal origin in the environment, as compared to the frequent direct spreading of untreated effluents."

        "abstract": "Recent studies suggest that obesity may protect hypertensives against cardiovascular disease (CVD). This concept was investigated by the Honolulu Heart Program, a prospective epidemiologic study of CVD in a cohort of Japanese-American men aged 45 to 65 years who have been followed up for 12 years. The combined effect of body mass index (BMI), as a measure of obesity, and blood pressure on coronary heart disease and CVD incidence was examined in 7554 men who were free of CVD and cancer at baseline. Rates of coronary heart disease and CVD were higher in the most obese than in the nonobese men for both normotensives and hypertensives. Blood pressure-BMI interaction was not significant for any CVD end point. Hypertension was associated with higher rates of coronary heart disease and CVD at all levels of BMI. This study supports the conclusion that hypertension is associated with an increased risk of CVD in both obese and nonobese men and that the relationship of blood pressure to CVD incidence does not vary with level of BMI. The inclusion of prevalent cases of CVD and the collapsing of continuous data into two categories may explain the results of earlier studies."

Administration of carnitine, dexamethasone, or fatty acid-free albumin resulted in prolongation of survival, less rise in intracranial pressure, and amelioration of some of the metabolic abnormalities found typically during octanoate infusion. Treatment with pentobarbital or dimethyl sulfoxide prevented intracranial pressure elevations but had no protective effect on survival. Hypertonic glucose administration produced no improvement in any of the parameters studied."

        "abstract": "With the use of an in vivo tritiated thymidine [( 3H]dThd) nuclear labeling followed by autoradiography, the effects at different times before sacrifice of prolactin (PRL) and/or 17 beta-estradiol (E2) were studied in C57BL X DBA/2f)F1 mice given transplants of the MXT hormone-sensitive mammary tumor whose growth was previously shown to be influenced by E2 and/or progesterone. Uteri were chosen as controls for the methodology. Experiments were conducted on ovariectomized mice submitted to endocrine manipulation to achieve plasma PRL modifications. In addition to E2, the proliferation of cancer cells, assessed by the measurement of thymidine labeling indices (TLIs), was demonstrated to be enhanced by ovine prolactin (oPRL) and Sulpiride and strongly slowed down by castration and 2-bromo-alpha-ergokryptin treatment, thus emphasizing the great importance of PRL in mammary cancer development. Moreover, a pulse of 1 mg oPRL/animal produced a marked TLI rise in tumors, lasting from the 6th to the 48th hour after its injection and reaching a maximum at 24 hours. PRL had no proliferative effect on the uterine luminal epithelium. When PRL and E2 were injected concomitantly, the profile of stimulation was quite similar to that obtained with E2 alone; i.e., a maximum stimulation was observed at the 24th and 36th hours after hormonal pulse. From these data it is concluded that, in spayed mice, not only E2 but also PRL is of major importance leading to enhanced proliferation of MXT mammary neoplastic cells. Further investigations are needed to throw light on the cellular events presiding over the action of PRL and E2 at the cancer cell level."

        "abstract": "Over a period of 10 years, 149 amputations were performed for lower limb ischaemia in 119 diabetic patients. Thirty patients required amputation of the second limb. Ninety per cent of the patients were over the age of 60 years. Sixty four ischaemic limbs were treated by primary local amputation or debridement--29 healed successfully, 30 proceeded to a higher amputation. The incidence of multiple local operations was high. A below knee amputation was performed in 56 limbs--7 failed to heal and required a more proximal amputation. Seventy five patients in the series have died; 58 of these survived less than 3 years from their first amputation. The hospital stay for all patients was long; for an unsuccessful local amputation the average stay was 109 days. Conservative management with the Scotchcast boot has been shown to be satisfactory. This must be compared with the significant costs to the patient of early operative intervention."

It is important to separate the active disease process of RSD from its resultant state of contracture and fibrosis. Our treatment program is based on active \"stress loading,\" which consists of active traction and compression exercises that provide stressful stimuli to the extremity without joint motion. Fifty-two patients with RSD were treated during a 3-year period. Their results and long-term follow-up on 41 patients are presented. The \"stress loading\" program has been used consistently during the past 20 years. The advantages of the program are its effectiveness, simplicity, safety, and noninvasiveness."

        "abstract": "Development of rifampin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis was documented in three patients receiving vancomycin and rifampin therapy for prosthetic valve endocarditis. The minimum inhibitory concentrations and minimum bactericidal concentrations of rifampin for the original three isolates were 0.4 micrograms/mL or less. Organisms cultured during relapse or prosthetic valve replacement had minimum inhibitory concentrations of rifampin that were 12.5, 50, and greater than 100 micrograms/mL, respectively. Surgical intervention was necessary in all patients. One died, and one required a second prosthetic valve placement. The patients were treated with vancomycin plus aminoglycoside following identification of rifampin resistance. These observations suggest that vancomycin and rifampin may not be adequate therapy for prosthetic valve endocarditis caused by S epidermidis."

        "abstract": "An iodine photodissociation laser generates the 1.315-micron infrared light used to heat the fiber and solvent. Heating of the cell contents by the direct absorption of laser energy is complete within the 100-microseconds rise time of the force transducer. A 5 degrees C temperature jump was usual. Interference with the force record by shock waves, electromagnetic disturbances, and uneven heating of fiber and solvent is minimal and close to the normal background noise of the transducer output. The postjump temperature of the cell remains static for a minimum of 400 ms before evidence of cooling is seen. The temperature of the cell could be changed rapidly. The cuvette contents could therefore be rapidly raised to, and lowered from, elevated prejump temperatures. As a result, sensitive biological samples are subjected to potentially denaturing conditions for the minimum length of time required for the temperature jump. Experiments on collagen and muscle fibers in which normal and rubber-like thermoelastic responses are kinetically resolved from each other are presented. The instrument offers substantial improvements in performance over other currently available designs."

The isolated cells appeared morphologically normal when examined microscopically, retaining their in vivo shape and internal structure. Enzyme analysis revealed that over 80% of the total gut lactase activity was associated with the isolated enterocytes. During incubation at 37 degrees C the cells maintained their structure for 30-60 min and consumed oxygen and produced lactate at a constant rate for at least 45 min. On the basis of these tests it was concluded that the method yielded large numbers of enterocytes which were able to be maintained in simple media without significant loss of structure or function for at least 45 min at 37 degrees C. Comparison of the metabolic activities of cells isolated from the two regions suggests that ileal enterocytes maintain the greater functional integrity, maintaining an intact plasma membrane for longer periods and having higher respiratory and glycolytic activities."

        "abstract": "In the present climate of quality-assurance policies, rigorous requirements for informed consent, and a constantly changing patient population, a system of preoperative risk assignment and postoperative correlation was developed to monitor and evaluate surgical performance. Patients were categorized by operation, priority (emergent, urgent, elective), New York Heart Association Functional Class, and risk. Risk was assigned before operation using data from the Coronary Artery Surgery Study (CASS) and the recent literature. Data were collected by a full-time data manager and were stored and analyzed by computer. From January 1, 1984, to July 1, 1985, 1,303 patients underwent operation for acquired disease. This group included 913 patients undergoing isolated primary coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The comparison of predicted and observed results showed: (Table: see text). For patients undergoing isolated primary CABG, the elective group had an operative mortality of 0.6% (2/329); the urgent group, 1.1% (5/450); and the emergent group, 5.2% (7/134). Preoperative risk assignment is an effective method of quality assurance. Female sex and age older than 60 years, which predicted an operative mortality of 2 to 5% in the CASS study and other recent series, did not predict a similar risk in our series."

        "abstract": "The bilayers in normal mammalian and human lung multilamellar bodies (LMB) are parallel, equally spaced, and continuous--a configuration that minimizes the large elastic strain energy associated with changing the equilibrium bilayer separation and the hydrophobic-hydrophilic repulsion energy between the hydrocarbon tails of phospholipid and the aqueous phase. This ideal behavior is disrupted at a limited population of large Burgers vector edge dislocations dissociated into +/- 1/2 disclination pairs. The configuration and interaction of the defects are explained by the continuum theory of liquid crystals and are shown to be identical to defects observed in in vitro surfactant liposomes and bilayers. We report the first observations with molecular resolution of the core structure of a liquid crystal dislocation. Defect cores are shown to be located between both headgroups and tailgroups in human LMB, suggesting that both types of core are similar in energy. This may be the result of partitioning of proteins or other nonlipid impurities in the LMB to the defect cores, which might also change the stability of the dislocations to favor their preservation. The edge dislocation defects interact in ways that minimize their overall strain energy. A population of edge dislocations may play an important role in the transport or localization of certain molecules through the lamellar body. Certain defects were observed in lung multilamellar bodies that have not been observed in in vitro systems; these are probably due to the complex, multicomponent nature of the LMB surfactant and the dynamic, in vivo environment of the LMB."

        "abstract": "A ca. 10-kilobase (kb) HindIII fragment of plasmid DNA from Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. israelensis was cloned into plasmid pUC9 and transformed into Escherichia coli. Extracts of the recombinant strain contained a 27-kilodalton (kDa) peptide that reacted with antibodies to a 27-kDa peptide isolated from crystals produced by B. thuringiensis subsp. israelensis. Extracts of the recombinant strain were hemolytic and toxic to Aedes aegypti larvae. Full expression of the 27-kDa peptide required the presence of a ca. 0.8-kb region of DNA located 4 kb upstream from the structural gene; the 0.8-kb region could be present in cis or trans relative to the gene and apparently acted post-transcriptionally. Analysis of maxicells showed that the 10-kb insert also coded for peptides of 67, 20, and 16 kDa; data obtained with different subclones suggest that the 20-kDa peptide is encoded in the 0.8-kb DNA region."

Intact, unreduced vWF, has ristocetin co-factor activity, which is lacking in the reduced subunits. To determine whether reduced vWF subunits are capable of being re-multimerized vWF was purified, reduced and then subsequently dialysed in the absence of reducing agents. (1) Purified vWF, (2) reduced vWF, and (3) reduced and dialysed vWF were compared for size composition and for ristocetin co-factor activities. SDS-PAGE showed that the purified vWF failed to enter the gels, while the reduced vWF migrated to a position consistent with a mass of approximately 240 kDa. Reduced and subsequently dialysed vWF subunits multimerized into larger forms, most of which did not enter the gels. No residual 240 kDa material was detectable following remultimerization. vWF multimer analysis confirmed the loss of monomer in the reduced and dialysed material and the appearance of new multimers with a size range smaller than the native material. Reduced vWF showed no detectable ristocetin co-factor activity, while the re-multimerized material regained some activity. Thus, we deduce that vWF can spontaneously re-multimerize from its reduced subunits and regain a small but measurable quantity of ristocetin co-factor activity."

Medium or large hemorrhages occurred after 42 operations (3.9%). Larger hemorrhages, hemorrhages in the suprasellar region, and hemorrhages associated with other types often preceded a poor outcome. Major etiologies underlying postoperative intracerebral hemorrhages were uncontrolled bleeding from a blind area, difficult dissection of a tumor from the brain, retraction injury, vessel injury from a needle, bleeding from a residual tumor, local hemodynamic changes after removal of a tumor, premature rupture of an aneurysm, and hypertensive putaminal hemorrhage. Hypertension during recovery from anesthesia was another important factor."

        "abstract": "The localization of chromatin-associated phospholipids has been demonstrated on chromosomes and on chromatin of interphase nuclei by cytochemical methods either in plant and in animal tissues. Three methods of fixation are suggested which can be combined which two cytochemical methods for phospholipids detection. An additional method is represented by autoradiographic technique after incorporation of a radioactive precursor such as [3H] ethanolamine. This method has been used with good results in nuclei of lateral root apices of Vicia faba on 1 micron thick section, thus avoiding any possible contamination by nuclear membrane. In these nuclei the phospholipids appear associated with the chromatin and more intensely with the nucleolar regions. The positivity of the cytochemical reaction disappears after extraction of fixed tissue with acidified methanol chloroform and after treatment of unfixed sections with phospholipase D. The use of phospholipid precursor has allowed the study of chromatin-phospholipids synthesis in root apices of Vicia faba with respect to timings of the cell cycle. The results show that there is a strong case for a pattern of chromatin phospholipid synthesis which operates during S phase. Concerning the role of phospholipids it is suggested that they may be linked to acidic protein and may have a structural function, particularly on the nucleoli."

        "abstract": "Although local epithelial-mesenchymal tissue interactions which are presumably mediated by extracellular matrix molecules are important regulators of tooth morphogenesis and differentiation, our studies have indicated that these developmental processes also depend on circulating molecules. The iron-carrying serum protein transferrin is necessary for the early morphogenesis of mouse tooth in organ culture (A-M. Partanen, I. Thesleff, and P. Ekblom, 1984, Differentiation 27, 59-66). In the present study we have examined the effects of other growth factors on mouse tooth germs grown in a chemically defined medium containing transferrin. Fibroblast growth factor and platelet derived growth factor had no detectable effects but epidermal growth factor (EGF) inhibited dramatically the morphogenesis of teeth, and prevented odontoblast and ameloblast cell differentiation. EGF stimulated cell proliferation in the explants measured as [3H]thymidine incorporation in DNA. However, when the distribution of dividing cells was visualized in autoradiographs, it was observed that cell proliferation was stimulated in the dental epithelium but was inhibited in the dental mesenchyme. The inhibition of cell proliferation in the dental mesenchyme apparently caused the inhibition of morphogenesis. We do not know whether the dental epithelium or mesenchyme was the primary target for the action of EGF in the inhibition of morphogenesis. It is, however, apparent that the response of the dental mesenchymal cells to EGF (inhibition of proliferation) is regulated by their local environment, since EGF enhanced proliferation when these cells were disaggregated and cultured as monolayers. This indicates that the organ culture system where the various embryonic cell lineages are maintained in their original environment corresponds better to the in vivo situation when the roles of exogenous growth factors during development are examined."

Morbidity is high in terms of recurrent fracture and deformity. Conventional methods of treatment have been ineffective in controlling these problems. The cases of four patients were reviewed to determine the natural history of polyostotic fibrous dysplasia involving the proximal part of the femur. In six femora, multiple osteotomies with fixation using a Zickel nail was utilized to provide definitive control of deformity and recurrent fracture and to allow the patients to return to normal activities."

        "abstract": "Sclerosteosis is a rare, potentially lethal, autosomal recessive, progressive craniotubular sclerosing bone dysplasia with characteristic facial and skeletal features. The temporal bone changes include a marked increase in overall size, extensive sclerosis, narrowing of the external auditory canal, and severe constriction of the internal auditory meatus, fallopian canal, eustachian tube, and middle ear cleft. Attenuation of the bony canals of the 9th, 10th, and 11th cranial nerves, reduction in size of the internal carotid artery, and severe obliteration of the sigmoid sinus and jugular bulb also occur. Loss of hearing, generally bilateral, is a frequent symptom. It often manifests in early childhood and initially is expressed as sound conduction impairment. Later, a sensorineural hearing loss and loss of vestibular nerve function often develop. Impairment of facial nerve function is another feature occasionally present at birth. In the beginning, a unilateral intermittent facial weakness may occur which eventually progresses to a bilateral permanent facial paresis. The histologic examination of the temporal bones from a patient with sclerosteosis explains the mechanisms involved in the progressive impairment of sound conduction and loss of cochlear, vestibular, and facial nerve function. There is a decrease of the arterial blood supply to the brain and an obstruction of the venous drainage from it. The histopathology reveals the obstacles to decompression of the middle ear cleft, ossicular chain, internal auditory and facial canals, and the risks, and in many instances the contraindications, to such procedures. On the other hand, decompression of the sigmoid sinus and jugular bulb should be considered as an additional life-saving procedure in conjunction with the prophylactic craniotomy recommended in all adult patients."

        "abstract": "The proportion of autologous rosette-forming, i.e. autoerythrocyte-binding, T-lymphocytes, was studied in 34 patients with untreated, operable bronchial carcinoma. The number of autorosettes in patients with bronchial carcinoma was considerably below the mean value for the normal control group. In patients with metastatic involvement of the regional lymph nodes at the time of surgery the reduction in the number of autorosettes was still more marked. On the 10th postoperative day after resection of the tumour and in case of remission five months after surgery, the number of autorosettes showed a significant rise approximating the normal value. The distribution of sheep-E-rosette-forming and of the \"active-early\" T-lymphocytes was also studied. On the evidence of the results, the number of autorosette-forming lymphocytes lends itself to a follow-up of bronchial carcinoma by early demonstration of remissions or recurrences."

Of the beta-fructofuranosidase activity in the liposomal preparations 96-100% was latent. The following observations were made in experiments with rats injected with protein-containing liposomes. 1. After injection of beta-fructofuranosidase-containing liposomes (220 units or 1.5mg of beta-fructofuranosidase and 17.5mg of lipid), beta-fructofuranosidase activity in blood retained its latency but the activity declined to 50% of the injected dose in 1h. Within 6h much of this activity was recovered in the liver and spleen (respectively 45% and 10% of that injected). For up to 21h after injection, the mitochondrial-lysosomal fraction was the principal location of the hepatic beta-fructofuranosidase activity. 2. Lysosomal localization of liposomal protein was supported by the observed increase in the trichloroacetic acid-soluble radioactivity during incubation of the lysosome-rich fraction of the liver of rats injected with liposomes containing (131)I-labelled albumin. 3. Association of liposomal protein with lysosomes was demonstrated on subfractionation of the mitochondrial-lysosomal fraction of the liver of rats injected with beta-fructofuranosidase-containing liposomes in a Ficoll-mannitol gradient. beta-Fructofuranosidase, lysosomal and mitochondrial enzyme marker activities were found to exhibit similar distribution patterns along the gradient. However, in similar experiments with rats previously injected with Triton WR-1339 or dextran (known to alter the specific gravity of lysosomes), only beta-fructofuranosidase and lysosomal marker moved along the gradient, in strikingly similar patterns. 4. The lysosomal localization of injected liposome-entrapped material can probably be utilized in the treatment of certain disorders in man."

        "abstract": "College students (25 men and 25 women) were randomly assigned (within sex) to each of the 4 factorial groups, based on manipulation of affect quality (positive vs. negative) and directional focus (internal vs. external) of mental imagery, and to a control group receiving no manipulation. Both imagery variables had a significant impact on pain tolerance and ratings during a cold-pressor test with positive affect and external imagery producing greater analgesia than their counterpart conditions. Positive affect imagery combined with external imagery resulted in the lowest reported pain amongst the groups. However, self-reported mood descriptors did not consistently parallel the pain tolerance and rating data. Likewise, although heart rate and skin potential responses increased during the cold pressor for the group as a whole, the only significant difference amongst the experimental groups was the relatively higher skin potential reactivity of the positive affect-external imagery group--possibly reflecting greater task engagement for this group. Seemingly, imagery in this situation operates primarily via cognitive, rather than via physiological mediators of the pain experience."

Lung function and exercise responses were investigated in two groups of Indian bagasse workers to assess whether there were any permanent sequelae following regular exposure to bagasse dust in a group of 12 men who had developed bagassosis and a group of six who had not. Ventilatory capacity, lung volumes, single breath carbon monoxide transfer factor (TF), diffusion capacity of the alveolar-capillary membrane (Dm), and volume of blood in the pulmonary capillaries (Vc) were measured, and then exercise responses were investigated with a cycle ergometer. The ventilatory response to hypercapnia was assessed by a modified re-breathing method. The group of 12 patients had small but significant reductions in lung volumes, TF, and Dm 7 to 10 years after the acute episode. The ventilatory responses to exercise and hypercapnia were increased but exercise capacity was normal and limited by the cardiovascular responses. Exercise hyperventilation was the likely explanation for the exertional dyspnoea in this group. Six of a group of workers who had been regularly exposed to mouldy bagasse dust without developing bagassosis and had a significant reduction in ventilatory capacity during exposure were found to have normal lung function and exercise responses two years after withdrawal from bagasse. Immunological reactivity to an extract of  was found to have subsided after withdrawal from bagasse dust, although it can persist for six years. In a single case, disodium cromoglycate failed to suppress the late systemic reaction provoked by the inhalation test."

The fluorochrome acridine orange was injected via a micropipette into Peyer's patches to fill lymphatics. The flux of labeled lymphocytes into intestinal microlymphatics was monitored with intravital fluorescence microscopy. The lymphatic microvessels in the perifollicular area of Peyer's patches were filled with lymphocytes, most of which remained within the lymphatics. Some lymphocytes became detached and were drained into intestinal lymph. Administration of antibodies directed against ICAM-1 significantly increased lymphocyte flux into interfollicular lymphatics. The immunohistochemical study showed intense ICAM-1 expression on the lymphocytes densely packed in the lymphatics surrounding follicles in Peyer's patches. A large number of lymphocytes are normally sequestered in the lymphatic network of Peyer's patches. This sequestration of lymphocytes is largely mediated by ICAM-1-dependent cell-cell interactions."

This of course produces high expectations. Due to the success of the combination therapy, the psychosocial problems associated with it have been pushed to the background. How do people living with HIV/AIDS evaluate the changes that occurred since the introduction of the new combination therapy? Which changes affect their daily routine most? Is there a need for change in nursing care? In order to address these questions, this study attempts to grasp and analyse the changes and coping strategies of people that are treated with combination therapy at source. The results are discussed taking a perspective of positive change and support. The main aim of this study was to contribute to a better understanding of people living with HIV/AIDS that are treated with combination therapy and to improve their professional support."

        "abstract": "G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) comprise the largest family of transmembrane receptors in the human genome that respond to a plethora of signals, including neurotransmitters, peptide hormones, and odorants, to name a few. They couple to second messenger signaling cascade mechanisms via heterotrimeric G-proteins. Recently, many studies have revealed that GPCRs exist as dimers, which may be present as homo- or heterodimers/oligomers. These recent findings have been met with skepticism, since they are contradictory to the dogma that GPCRs function as monomers. Although the existence of GPCR dimers/oligomers was predicted from early pharmacological and biochemical studies, further studies to critically evaluate this phenomenon were impeded by the lack of appropriate reagents. The availability of cDNAs for GPCRs, of highly selective ligands and of antibodies for these receptors has made it possible to visualize and investigate the functional effects of GPCR oligomers. Pharmacological studies, along with biochemical techniques, such as cross-linking and immunoprecipitation with differentially epitope-tagged receptors, have been employed to demonstrate the oligomerization of a number of GPCRs. Moreover, recent biophysical techniques, such as bioluminescence and fluorescence resonance energy transfer, now make it possible to examine GPCR dimerization/oligomerization in living cells. In this review, we provide a brief overview of some of the techniques employed to describe GPCR dimers, and we discuss their respective limitations. We also examine the implications of dimerization/oligomerization on GPCR function. In addition, we discuss domains of the receptors that are thought to facilitate dimerization/oligomerization. Finally, we consider recent evidence for the subcellular localization of the dimer/oligomer assembly."

Cultures were incubated for 2 to 4 h in a simple growth medium and tested by GLC for putrescine and cadaverine, the direct decarboxylation products of ornithine and lysine, respectively. Results obtained with various Enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonads, and vibrios showed that the GLC procedure was superior to the conventional test; clear, well-defined results were obtained within 3 to 5 h, even with cultures which gave weak, delayed, or variable reactions by M\u00f8ller's method. This GLC procedure for the determination of decarboxylase reactions would be useful in microbiological laboratories for culture identification and for various other enzymatic studies."

        "abstract": "The cytokinetics of the antibody to Type III pneumococcal polysaccharide (SSS-III) were characterized by an immuno-plaque procedure using erythrocytes sensitized with SSS-III. Prior immunization, irrespective of the doses employed, did not result in the development of immunological memory; instead, low-dose paralysis was produced in mice previously immunized with all doses of SSS-III. Dose-response studies revealed that within a given dose range, there was a direct relationship between the immunizing dose and the magnitude of the antibody response obtained. The dose-response curve for SSS-III showed a single optimal dose for immunization; doses only slightly in excess of the optimal dose produced a significant reduction in the magnitude of the antibody response. The implications of these findings, with respect to the development of paralysis to SSS-III, are discussed."

        "abstract": "Human peripheral lymphocytes were investigated for receptors binding Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) because of the regular association of this virus with infectious mononucleosis and Burkitt's lymphoma. This was done by a cytoadherence technique where virus-producing cells, displaying fresh viral determinants in their cytoplasmatic membrane, were mixed with lymphocytes. Unfractionated lymphocytes were found to adhere to these cells in contrast to column-purified T lymphocytes. The specificity of the binding was confirmed by blocking experiments that showed that sera containing high titers of antibodies directed against the virus could partially inhibit the adherence in contrast to low-titer sera. It is concluded that B lymphocytes, in contrast to T lymphocytes, have receptors for EBV. In a second line of experiments it was found that established human lymphoblastoid lines that carry the EBV genome had receptors characteristic for B lymphocytes and did not form T-lymphocyte rosettes. In contrast, a line of known T-lymphocyte origin that did not carry the EBV genome had receptors characteristic for T lymphocytes. EBV-transformed simian lymphoblastoid lines had surface markers indicating a B-lymphocyte origin in contrast to HVS-transformed simian lines that lacked surface immunoglobulin but carried receptors for sheep red blood cells."

        "abstract": "Low levels of impurities need to be determined in drugs. Consequently, if UV detection is used, a large sample amount must be loaded and as narrow peaks as possible obtained. The sample matrix and the stability of the samples as well as the peak resolution should be considered when the electrolyte is chosen. In this study the influence of the sample matrix composition with varying background electrolytes on the peak appearance of model mixtures loaded in large amounts was investigated. A robust electrolyte for analysis of bases in a sample with varying pH was found to consist of a buffering co-ion and a buffering counter-ion (the pH was approximately 4.2 in the electrolyte). If a minor component has higher mobility than the macrocomponent and the co-ion, better peak shape can be obtained if, for instance, enough sodium chloride is added to the sample, i.e., sample self-stacking is exploited. The effect of addition of organic modifiers, isopropanol or acetonitrile, was examined and good linearity and precision have been shown for impurities in the concentration range tested, approximately 0.03 to 5 mol% of the main component, in model mixtures."

Within 24 h she showed a marked deterioration and died shortly afterwards. Autopsy samples from a range of tissues were analysed to confirm a clinical diagnosis of rabies. Phylogenetic analysis of the viral nucleoprotein gene confirmed that this was an infection with a genotype 1 virus (classical rabies) belonging to the Africa 2 group, which is endemic in Northern Africa. Comparison of both the nucleoprotein and glycoprotein coding sequences of this isolate with an imported case of human rabies from 1996, also from Nigeria, showed that the two viruses were 99% homologous."

Studies on the influence of pH on the rates indicate that only deprotonated forms of these compounds act as reducing agents, with the dianionic forms being the most effective. The pH-independent second-order rate constants are reported. Hammett treatment of the effects of substituents on the aromatic ring structure of the reductants show that for electron transfer to occur the charge on the deprotonated species must not be withdrawn on to the substituents. Possible sites for electron donation to cytochrome c are discussed, and the results indicate that the haem edge is a likely candidate."

        "abstract": "The histamine content of weighed replicates of chopped human lung was found to vary greatly. Replicates also varied considerably in the amount of histamine released after passive sensitization with IgE and challenge with antigen. The amount of immunological release of histamine was poorly related to tissue histamine content. Consequently, expression of release as percent of content did not lead to any decrease in the amount of variation between replicates."

        "abstract": "The platelet content of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), adenosine diphosphate (ADP), serotonin and ouabain-insensitive, magnesium-dependent adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) was determined in patients with chronic renal failure, patients on chronic hemodialysis, and kidney transplant recipients. Platelet ATP content was normal in all. By contrast, ADP content, expressed in mumol/10(11) platelets, was significantly lower in renal failure: 1.82 +/- 0.96 compared to 2.51 +/- 0.97 in normals (p less than 0.05), but not in dialyzed or transplanted patients; 2.27 +/- 0.96 and 1.87 +/- 0.87, respectively. The mean content of serotonin was also significantly lower in renal failure patients: 0.52 microgram/10(9) platelets as compared to 0.90 microgram/10(9) platelets in normals (p less than 0.05) but was not significantly different in dialyzed and transplanted patients. ATPase was significantly lower in renal failure: 3.13 +/- 1.2 mumol Pi/10(9) platelets in whole suspension and 0.71 +/- 0.22 Pi/mg protein/h in membrane preparation compared to 4.74 +/- 1.1 and 1.18 +/- 0.19, respectively, in normals, and was significantly lower in dialyzed and transplanted patients. Experimental azotemia (BUN 65-86 mg/100 ml), induced by the oral ingestion of urea 2-3 g/kg body weight over 24 h, failed to induce any of these abnormalities. The abnormality in platelet ADP and serotonin content in renal failure paralleled the functional platelet defects which characterize these patients and were reversible following dialysis and transplantation."

        "abstract": "First- and third-generation cloned progeny viruses were derived from clinical isolates of herpes simplex virus and examined for their sensitivities to human interferon by inhibition of plaque formation in Vero cells. The dose-response curves obtained with the first- and third-generation clones were similar to those obtained with the parental isolates, and both the parent and the clones showed similar sensitivities to interferon. These results suggest that clinical isolates of herpes simplex virus consist of a homogeneous population of virus particles with respect to interferon sensitivity. The dose-response curves obtained with herpes simplex virus demonstrated a shallower slope than those obtained with vesicular stomatitis virus. Vesicular stomatitis virus plaque formation as completely inhibited at high concentrations of interferon, whereas complete inhibition of plaque formation by herpes simplex virus did not occur at the highest concentration of interferon used. Cloned progeny were derived from plaques appearing in the presence of high concentrations of interferon. The dose-response curves and interferon sensitivities of these clones were similar to those of the parent and third-generation clone from which they were derived. There was no evidence for genetic heterogeneity with respect to interferon sensitivity."

        "abstract": "The purpose of the present investigation was to compare the solubilizing effect of methohexital on the mitochondrially bound hexokinase activity in brain and heart tissue of the rat. Experiments were performed using intact rats, the isolated perfused rat brain and heart as well as mitochondrial fractions from rat brain and heart tissue. It was shown that bound hexokinase activity was significantly solubilized by methohexital in brain tissue in vivo and in the isolated perfused rat brain but no effect was demonstrable in heart tissue. When mitochondrial fractions were incubated with methohexital in vitro, hexokinase activity was significantly solubilized from brain mitochondria but only slightly from heart mitochondria although glucose-6-phosphate was able to displace hexokinase also from heart mitochondria. The results suggest that mitochondrially bound hexokinase activity in brain tissue is particularly sensitive against the solubilizing effect of anesthetics. This effect could contribute to the sensitivity of brain function and metabolism against anesthetic drugs."

The substrates used are alpha-naphthyl ester derivatives of N alpha-tosyl-L-lysine, N alpha-acetylglycyl-L-ination of alpha-naphthol released from them. Use of these alpha-naphthyl ester derivatives made the method more sensitive than the use of the corresponding methyl or ethyl ester derivatives. The minimum detectable concentrations of trypsin, chymotrypsin, plasmin, thrombin and urokinase in this method were about 0.002 micrograms, 0.01 microgram, 0.002 CU, 0.01 IU, and 2 IU, respectively. The Km values of trypsin and thrombin for TLNE were 0.11 mM and 0.15 mM while those for TLME were 2.5 mM and 6.7 mM, respectively; the Km values of chymotrypsin for ATNE and ATEE were 0.18 mM and 0.7 mM, respectively; and the Km values of urokinase for AGLNE and AGLME were 0.17 mM and 4 mM, respectively. Zymograms of various proteases were easy to prepare using these alpha-naphthyl ester substrates, and zymograms of trypsin and chymotrypsin were made with TLNE and ATNE, respectively, as substrates."

        "abstract": "Under normal conditions, glucose acutely influences pancreatic islet B, A and D cell secretion. In addition, prior exposure to glucose modulates the secretory responsiveness of these cells (priming effect). We have tested whether alloxan diabetes influences priming effects of glucose on A and D cell secretion. Rat pancreases were perfused 72 h after alloxan treatment. A 20 min infusion of 27.7 mmol/l of glucose failed to induce priming effects, i.e. it did not inhibit the glucagon nor amplify the somatostatin response to a subsequent (15 min later) infusion of 8 mmol/l of arginine. Insulin treatment in vivo for 48 h restored a priming effect of glucose on glucagon secretion in the perfused pancreas, i.e. exposure to 27.7 mmol/l of glucose now inhibited subsequent arginine-induced glucagon secretion by 48% relative to a stimulation period with arginine preceding the glucose pulse (from 5.0 +/- 0.7 to 2.6 +/- 0.5 ng/min, p less than 0.01). Conversely, insulin treatment in vivo did not restore a priming effect of glucose on somatostatin secretion. Other effects noted were failure of 27.7 mmol/l glucose to stimulate, during its presence, the release of somatostatin from pancreases of the diabetic rats whether untreated or insulin-treated. Furthermore, insulin treatment abolished the arginine-induced somatostatin secretion observed in pancreases from untreated rats. It is concluded that short-term alloxan diabetes leads to loss of a priming effect of glucose on glucagon secretion and that this abnormality is secondary to direct or indirect effects of insulinopenia. Concomittant abnormalities of glucose regulation of somatostatin secretion may, in part, be secondary to a cytotoxic effect of alloxan on the D cell."

        "abstract": "The effects of aspirin on epithelial cell membrane potentials of Necturus fundic mucosa were examined by in vitro experiments according to intracellular microelectrode techniques. Stable intracellular impalements were obtained with 15 to 50 M-ohm microelectrodes filled with 3M KCl. In neutral mucosal solutions (pH 7.0) aspirin (5.0 mM) resulted in a significant increase in apical cell membrane potential (Vmc) from -36.7 +/- 1.5 mV to -43.3 +/- 2.3 mV (p less than 0.001) and basolateral cell membrane potential (Vcs) from -42.7 +/- 1.8 mV to -50.6 +/- 2.4 (p less than 0.001). This hyperpolarization of the cell was associated with an increase in transmucosal potential from -5.8 +/- 0.7 to -7.4 +/- 0.9 (p less than 0.05) and an increase in the ratio of apical to basolateral membrane resistances from 5.1 +/- 1.2 to 8.8 +/- 1.9 (p less than 0.05). These changes were consistent with an increase in potassium conductance induced by the salicylate anion. In acidic mucosal solutions (pH 4.5) aspirin caused a reduction in Vmc and Vcs. This hypopolarization of the cell membrane is consistent with acidification of the epithelial cells. These observations support the proposed mechanisms of aspirin injury: (1) back diffusion of H+ into the cells and (2) influx of the salicylate anions into the cells, which may interfere with intracellular metabolism."

        "abstract": "Acetazolamide is effective treatment for myotonia in certain patients with myotonia congenita. Since potassium metabolism may be abnormal in myotonia congenita, we studied the effect of acetazolamide administration on potassium regulation and glucose disposal, using the euglycemic insulin clamp technique in patients with myotonic disorders and in normal subjects. Glucose disposal was normal in patients with myotonia congenita; administration of acetazolamide increased glucose disposal in normal subjects and in patients with myotonia congenita. By contrast, patients with myotonic dystrophy showed insulin resistance and decreased glucose disposal that was not improved by acetazolamide administration. Patients with myotonia congenita had elevated potassium levels in the basal state and a greater fall in potassium level during the insulin clamp procedure than controls. Patients with myotonic dystrophy had normal or low basal potassium levels and a subnormal decrease in potassium level during the insulin clamp procedure. Administration of acetazolamide did not alter these abnormalities in potassium metabolism in patients with either myotonia congenita or myotonic dystrophy."

We conclude that prazosin seems to be an effective therapeutic alternative in patients with benign prostatic obstruction."

The result is presented so as to be applicable to arbitrary ions for which the necessary interaction data are known.

Comparison with recent experimental data obtained at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory reveals the need for more accurate fragmentation data."

        "abstract": "The effects of restoring serosal potassium to potassium-depleted toad urinary bladders have been re-examined using double-barrelled microelectrodes. The data confirm the existence of a time-lag phenomenon, a dissociation between potassium reaccumulation and restoration of short-circuit current. Returning serosal potassium stimulates an increase in intracellular potassium activity 21-26 min before any increase can be detected in short-circuit current. The reaccumulation of potassium has been further studied using split frog skin, a far more suitable preparation for electrophysiologic study than toad bladder. Under baseline short-circuited conditions, potassium is accumulated against an electrochemical gradient of 22 +/- 4 mV. Reaccumulation of potassium by potassium-depleted tissues can be blocked by inhibiting the Na,K-exchange pump with high concentrations of ouabain. On the other hand, blocking apical sodium entry by the addition of 10(-4) M amiloride to the outer bathing medium does not interfere with reaccumulation of potassium. The data support the concept that the time-lag phenomenon of toad bladder reflects stimulation of potassium reaccumulation by the sodium pump in exchange for the extrusion of excess cell sodium collected during the period of potassium depletion. This reaccumulation of potassium can proceed before the entry of significant added amounts of sodium across the apical plasma membrane."

The decrease of the number of worms in the animals under experiment shows that these associations still give a protective effect. This protection is however weaker than the one which is induced by estrogens administration only. The interpretation of these results agree with the intervention of an estrogen receptor."

Although she was free of constitutional symptoms, laboratory evaluation revealed substantial evidence of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). This included a positive anti-nuclear antibody test (rim pattern), positive LE cell preparation test, elevated anti-double-stranded DNA activity, positive lupus band test (IgM and C3) in involved and uninvolved skin, and renal biopsy findings consistent with SLE. Sclerodermatous change as an initial sign of SLE is rare. We review previous reports of an association of circumscribed scleroderma, especially the linear form, with serologic evidence of systemic autoimmune disease."

In the guinea-pig ileum and field stimulated rat vas deferens the pKB values against SK were similar to those against SP indicating a single population of receptors. In the guinea-pig urinary bladder the pKB value against SK was significantly higher suggesting the existence of at least two subtypes of tachykinin receptor in this tissue. In the hamster urinary bladder no antagonism was observed with up to 30 microM RPTTL-SP indicating the possibility of a third type of receptor."

        "abstract": "In order to reveal possible differences between pre- and postsynaptic muscarine receptors, seven antagonists were tested for their affinities on these receptor sites in the rabbit isolated perfused heart. Methacholine was used as an agonist to inhibit the noradrenaline overflow evoked by electrical stimulation (3 Hz, 3 min) of the sympathetic nerves (presynaptic parameter) and to decrease the systolic tension development of the right atrium (postsynaptic parameter). The affinity of an antagonist was expressed as pA2. A decreasing order of potency was obtained with ipratropium, scopolamine, atropine, trihexyphenidyl, amitriptyline, and gallamine, both for pre- and postsynaptic responses. The antagonists acted competitively and their effects were reversible. Furthermore, for none of the drugs did the pA2 (pre) differ from the pA2 (post). With QNB (3-quinuclidinyl benzilate) a pA2 (post) of 11.65 was obtained. However, the affinity to presynaptic receptors could not be determined as a pA2 value due to the very prolonged exposure time required for the equilibrium with QNB and for that with methacholine in the presence of QNB. It is concluded that the antagonists employed do not reveal differences between pre- and postsynaptic muscarine receptors of the rabbit heart, in spite of their greatly varying chemical structure and their individual affinities ranging over 5 orders of magnitude. The findings confirm the view of a homogeneous muscarine receptor population characterized by functional parameters."

Yeast polysaccharides had a nonspecific activating effect on macrophages in tissue culture. They enhance the adhesion of macrophages to glass, stimulate phagocytosis and intracellular digestion, and change the chemotactic activity. The activity of polysaccharides directly correlates with their molecular weight. There is a relationship between the biological activity and chemical structure of polysaccharides. The beta-structural polysaccharides are capable of activating the functions of macrophages, while beta-structural dextrans do not possess such properties."

The factor (m.w. = 70K) co-purified with albumin, monitored by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and demonstrated a heterogeneous isoelectric point (pI 7.6-7.8). Xenoantisera produced against the DEAE-purified fraction and coupled to Affigel 10 removed suppressive activity that could subsequently be eluted by glycine-HCl, pH 3.5. An anti-albumin column partially removed activity, but the unbound 70K factor could still be detected in the column effluent. A xenoantiserum to this 70K effluent coupled to acrylamide beads completely removed the immunosuppressive activity in immunodepletion experiments. Further direct binding enzyme-linked immunoassays (ELISA) and solid-phase immunoabsorption experiments with monoclonal antibodies to human anti-HLA-DR framework determinants and a constant region of the IgM mu-chain demonstrated determinants on the 70K factor recognized by these antibodies."

In the absence of Chi, some of the interactions splice lambda dv into lambda, whereas others patch information from lambda dv into lambda. When Chi is in the phage DNA, splices and patches are increased in frequency by the same factor. This result strengthens the analogy between Chi and recombination-promoting elements in fungi. It also rules out one model for the previously reported orientation dependence of Chi phenotype."

        "abstract": "Endogenous mechanisms of inhibition in magnocellular neuroendocrine cells were studied with intracellular recordings in the rat hypothalamic slice preparation. Hyperpolarizing after-potentials (duration up to 125 ms) followed single action potentials and after-hyperpolarizations (a.h.p.s) lasting hundreds of milliseconds followed brief evoked spike trains. The amplitude and duration of the a.h.p. increased after spike trains of longer duration or higher frequency. The a.h.p. appears endogenous, rather than synaptically mediated from recurrent inhibition, because it persisted after pharmacological blockade of axonal conduction or of chemical synaptic transmission. The reversal potential of the a.h.p. was at least 20 mV more negative than that of inhibitory post-synaptic potentials. Cl- ionophoresis did not alter the a.h.p. Chelation of intracellular Ca2+ with EGTA injection eliminated the a.h.p. A Ca2+-activated K+ conductance, rather than recurrent synaptic inhibition, apparently causes the a.h.p. and is at least partly responsible for the inhibition after single spikes in magnocellular neurones. During hormone release, this endogenous mechanism may contribute to the post-burst silent period in putative oxytocinergic cells and to the interburst interval in phasic neurones, which are known to fire repetitive bursts associated with vasopressin release."

        "abstract": "Within the hematopoietic system, monoclonal antibodies reactive with antigenic determinants, expressed in a lineage- and stage-restricted fashion, can be used to map myeloid differentiation. We have generated a series of monoclonal antibodies that reacts with myeloid-associated determinants on committed myeloid stem cells and their progeny. Their reactivity with peripheral blood cells was identified by immunofluorescence assays, with bone marrow cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting, and with committed hematopoietic progenitor cells by both cytotoxic assays and fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Antibody 1G10, which has previously been reported to react with cells of the granulocytic lineage and with a minor subset of mature monocytes, was shown to react with granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units (CFU-GM). Three antibodies not previously characterized (T5A7, L4F3, L1B2) were shown to react with both granulocytic and monocytic cells and in fluorescence-activated cell sorting studies to detectably stain granulocytic cells at different stages of maturation. These three antibodies also react with CFU-GM, two (L4F3 and L1B2) reacting with all CFU-GM, while T5A7 reacts with only a portion of the day 7 CFU-GM. Antibody L4F3 also reacts with a portion of erythroid burst-forming units (BFU-E). In contrast, the previously reported antibody 5F1, which reacts with monocytic cells, nucleated erythroid cells, and platelets, was shown to react with erythroid colony-forming units (CFU-E). Potential applications of these antibodies to studies of normal and malignant hematopoiesis are discussed."

        "abstract": "There was extensive and exuberant breeding of waterbirds before and during an epidemic of arboviral encephalitis in the Murray Valley of south eastern Australia in 1974. As estimated by haemagglutination inhibition tests on 432 bird sera collected between 4th and 13th February, 1974, infection with Murray Valley encephalitis virus, Kunjin virus and possibly other flaviviruses was concentrated in species of the Order Ciconiiformes (55% positive) and Pelecaniformes (41%), compared with only 5% in Anseriformes. Although Sindbis virus infections were also highest in these 2 Orders (56% and 46%, respectively), the incidence of antibodies was spread more uniformly through other Orders than with the flaviviruses: e.g. Anseriformes, 33%, Podicipitiformes, 27%. As viruses were recovered virtually only from Culex annulirostris mosquitoes, the different patterns of infection seem unrelated to host preference by mosquito species or behavioural response to mosquito attack, and suggest a specific relationship between MVE/KUN and Ciconiiformes and Pelecaniformes. The highest infection rate was 22/25 in mature rufous night herons (formerly nankeen night herons) Nycticorax calendonicus, and here tolerance to mosquito attack was probably a contributing factor. Assays of sera from 13 horses indicated high infection rates both alphaviruses and flaviviruses."

        "abstract": "A derivative of the IncP-1 plasmid RP1, temperature-sensitive for maintenance, was inserted into the Pseudomonas aeruginosa chromosome by selection for a plasmid marker (carbenicillin resistance) at non-permissive temperature. In one strain, PAO 1000, the plasmid was stably integrated in the trpA, B gene cluster mapped at 27 min, as shown by the following evidence. (i) Trp+ transductants lost all plasmid markers. (ii) Cleared lysates of PAO 1000 showed no plasmid band typical of the autonomous RP1 in agarose gel electrophoresis. (iii) No transfer of carbenicillin resistance by PAO 1000 was detectable. (iv) PAO 1000 mobilised the chromosome from an origin at, or very near, the plasmid insertion site with high frequency (recovery of proximal markers greater than or equal to 10(-3) per donor). Matings on the plate with and without interruption of conjugation showed that chromosome transfer was unidirectional. (v) Recombinants from PAO 1000-mediated crosses did not inherit plasmid markers or the trpA, B mutation. A derivative of PAO 1000 was obtained which had lost the Hfr property and all plasmid markers except carbenicillin resistance. This strain (PAO 1001), when carrying the autonomous RP1 plasmid, was capable of unidirectional chromosome mobilisation like PAO 1000, but with 50-fold lower efficiency. We propose that integration of the temperature-sensitive RP1 plasmid in PAO 1000 occurred via transposition of Tn1, the element specifying carbenicillin resistance."

        "abstract": "Contents obtained from jejunum of normal controls, self-emptying and self-filling blind loop rats were analyzed for the presence of glycoprotein-degrading glycosidases. The blind loop syndrome was documented by the increased fat excretion and slower growth rate of self-filling blind loop rats 6 wk after surgery. With p-nitrophenylglycosides as substrate, the specific activity of alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase, a potential blood group A destroying glycosidase, was 0.90+/-0.40 mU/mg of protein. This level was 23-fold higher than the specific activity of normal controls. In partially purified self-filling blind loop contents, the activity of alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase was 9- to 70-fold higher than activities of self-emptying and normal controls. Antibiotic treatment with chloromycetin and polymyxin decreased 24-fold the glycosidase levels in self-filling blind loops. In experiments with natural substrate, the blood group A titer of a20,000g supernate from normal jejunal homogenates decreased 128-fold after 24-h incubation with blind loop contents. Normal contents failed to diminish the blood group reactivity of the natural substrate. Furthermore, blind loop contents markedly decreased the blood group A titer of isolated brush borders. Incubation between blind loop bacteria and mucosal homogenates or isolated brush borders labeled with d-[U-(14)C]glucosamine revealed increased production of labeled ether extractable organic acids. Likewise, intraperitoneal injection of d-[U-(14)C]glucosamine into self-filling blind loop rats resulted in incorporation of the label into luminal short chain fatty acids. These results suggest that glycosidases may provide a mechanism by which blind loop bacteria obtain sugars from intestinal glycoproteins. The released sugars are used and converted by bacteria into energy and organic acids. This use of the host's glycoproteins would allow blind loop bacteria to grow and survive within the lumen independent of exogenous sources."

        "article_title": "Integrating pictorial information across eye movements.",
        "abstract": "Six experiments are reported dealing with the types of information integrated across eye movements in picture perception. A line drawing of an object was presented in peripheral vision, and subjects made an eye movement to it. During the saccade, the initially presented picture was replaced by another picture that the subject was instructed to name as quickly as possible. The relation between the stimulus on the first fixation and the stimulus on the second fixation was varied. Across the six experiments, there was about 100-130 ms facilitation when the pictures were identical compared with a control condition in which only the target location was specified on the first fixation. This finding clearly implies that information about the first picture facilitated naming the second picture. Changing the size of the picture from one fixation to the next had little effect on naming time. This result is consistent with work on reading and low-level visual processes in indicating that pictorial information is not integrated in a point-by-point manner in an integrated visual buffer. Moreover, only about 50 ms of the facilitation for identical pictures could be attributed to the pictures having the same name. When the pictures represented the same concept (e.g., two different pictures of a horse), there was a 90-ms facilitation effect that could have been the result of either the visual or conceptual similarity of the pictures. However, when the pictures had different names, only visual similarity produced facilitation. Moreover, when the pictures had different names, there appeared to be inhibition from the competing names. The results of all six experiments are consistent with a model in which the activation of both the visual features and the name of the picture seen on the first fixation survive the saccade and combine with the information extracted on the second fixation to produce identification and naming of the second picture."

All patients were treated with 6 courses of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and vincristine (CAV). Responding patients also received prophylactic cranial irradiation and local irradiation to prechemotherapy intrathoracic disease. Among the 70% (85/121) of patients who responded to chemotherapy, 41 have received UHBI, given one to two months later. The single fraction midline dose given has been increased in successive patients from 300 to 720 cGy (uncorrected for inhomogeneities). Actual lung doses were higher by 9-22%, (determined in 31 patients by CT scanning and lung density measurements). Adverse effects seen were vomiting, fever, drowsiness, myelosuppression, liver dysfunction and dry mouth. All were transient, and no pneumonitis or treatment deaths occurred. Adverse effect rates were similar at all dose levels. UHBI is well tolerated in patients who have received chemotherapy and merits further study."

        "abstract": "We studied the relationship between specific IgE antibodies, nonspecific bronchial reactivity to methacholine, and the type of asthmatic reaction in patients with red cedar asthma. The level of circulating specific IgE antibodies (expressed as RAST ratios) was not related to the type of asthmatic reaction, the degree of nonspecific bronchial hyperreactivity [expressed by the provocative concentration of methacholine producing a 20% decrease in the forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (PC20)] or the index of reactivity to plicatic acid. On the other hand, methacholine PC20 was found to correlate with the index of reactivity to plicatic acid in the late asthmatic reaction (LAR) and both the immediate and late components of the dual asthmatic reaction (DAR). Development of the LAR is associated with increase in nonspecific bronchial hyperreactivity. Repeated inhalation challenge with plicatic acid in eight patients with LAR resulted in DAR in all. The results suggest that the mechanism responsible for the LAR is associated with an increase in nonspecific bronchial reactivity; furthermore, the immediate component of DAR could also be related to heightened bronchial hyperreactivity."

        "abstract": "1. (Na+ + K+)-dependent adenosine triphosphatase was phosphorylated on the alpha-subunit by Pi in the presence of Mg2+. Phosphorylation was stimulated by ouabain. The interactions of Pi, Mg2+, and ouabain with the enzyme could be explained by a random terreactant scheme in which the binding of each ligand to the enzyme increased the affinities for the other two. Dissociation constants of all steps of this scheme were estimated. 2. In the presence of Pi and ouabain and without added Mg2+, the phosphoenzyme was formed. Because this could be prevented by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, but not ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid, phosphoenzyme formation under these conditions was probably dependent on traces of endogenous Mg2+. The ability of this Mg2+ to support phosphorylation could be explained by the large increase in the enzyme's affinity for Mg2+ by ouabain. 3. In the absence of ouabain, Ca2+ did not support phosphorylation and inhibited Mg2+-dependent phosphorylation. At lower concentrations, Ca2+ was competitive with Mg2+. With increasing Ca2+ concentration, negative cooperativity was observed, suggesting the existence of multiple divalent cation sites with equivalent affinities for Mg2+, but varying affinities for Ca2+. 4. In the presence of ouabain, the maximum inhibition of Mg2+-dependent phosphorylation by Ca2+ was 50%. With saturating Pi, Mg2+, and ouabain, the number of sites binding ouabain was equal to the number of sites phosphorylated. Although Ca2+ halved phosphorylation and reduced the affinity for ouabain about 100-fold, it did not affect the number of ouabain sites. 5. We suggest that the enzyme is an alpha-oligomer and that the half-of-the-sites reactivity for phosphorylation in the presence of Pi, Mg2+, ouabain, and optimal Ca2+ is caused by (a) ouabain-induced increase in the affinities of both protomers for Mg2+ and (b) the inability of Ca2+ to replace Mg2+ on one of the protomers."

The authors found that the terminology applied to such tumors in the literature is confusing largely because of lack of consistency in criteria used to establish the diagnosis. The authors propose that the term glomus tumor be reserved for tumors composed of endothelial-lined vascular spaces surrounded by smooth muscle cells. Hemangiopericytoma should be used for similar tumors composed of pericytes with or without other types of perivascular mesenchymal cells. According to these criteria, this case is the third glomus tumor reported in the lung."

        "abstract": "A rabbit model was used to study the changes in intracranial pressure and parenchymal morphology that accompany epidural compression. A catheter in the left lateral ventricle and an intraparenchymal moist wick in each cerebral hemisphere were used to monitor intracranial pressures. With the balloon uninflated, the pressures in 12 rabbits were similar: 67.8 +/- 34.9 mmH2O for the left lateral ventricle, 61.7 +/- 31.0 mmH2O for the right parenchymal wick, and 58.3 +/- 29.1 mmH2O for the left parenchymal wick (mean +/- S.D.). With inflation of a right parietal epidural balloon to 0.4 cm3, the left ventricular pressure rose significantly to 168 +/- 57.5 mmH2O (p less than 0.001, Student's t-test) and the right hemisphere parenchymal pressure to 114.3 +/- 52.1 mmH2O (p less than 0.001). The left frontal parenchymal pressure increased, but not significantly. There was no evidence of blood-brain barrier breakdown by the Evans blue dye technique 2 hours after compression. Similarly, there was no infarction as gauged by 235triphenyl-2M-tetrazolium chloride infusion at 2 weeks. These data demonstrate that significant pressure asymmetries between hemispheres occur with epidural compression. In the rabbit, a 0.4-cm3 mass is not enough to cause blood-brain barrier breakdown or tissue necrosis. In the first 2 hours of compression th ventricular pressure is higher than the parenchymal pressure, perhaps because of obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid flow around the convexities."

In two cultures from ALS, bovine leukemia virus (BLV) antigen was constantly detected. On the other hand, BLV antigen remained negative in cultures from two CLS and one TLS cases up to 40 passages. The RNA dependent DNA polymerase activities in these cultures were also negative. Treatment of a culture from CLS (3178) originated from liver tumor with 5'-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine (IdU) and dexamethasone (DXM) resulted in production of an agent serologically and morphologically similar to BLV and in alteration of cell morphology. No virus was detected in culture from TLS after treatment with IdU and DXM."

        "abstract": "Murine bone marrow progenitor cells that gave rise to macrophage colonies in semisolid agar were found to be more sensitive to prostaglandins of the E series (PGE) than were precursor cells of granulocytes and megakaryocytes. Macrophage colonies themselves had different sensitivities to the molecule. Precursor cells of macrophages that formed colonies in the presence of a stimulating activity from L cells (L-cell CSA) were inhibited to 50% levels by 3 x 10(-9)-M PGE. Macrophage progenitor cells, which require both L-cell CSA and rat hemolysate for colony growth, were inhibited to the same level by 3 x 10(-7)-M PGE. Other colony types (granulocytes and megakaryocytes) were sensitive to PGE only at concentrations greater than 10(-6) M. Accordingly, addition of different PGE concentrations to the culture assay should allow easy detection of precursor cells with morphologically distinct end cells. The different sensitivities to PGE of two macrophage colony types of different maturation stages indicate that PGE may provide feedback to control macrophage formation by inhibiting proliferation and differentiation of immature monocytoid cells."

        "abstract": "Alterations occur in human muscle electrolyte and water composition in response to infection. There appear to be at least two basic mechanisms; the first is an exchange of sodium for potassium without alteration in water content of muscle. The second is an increase in cellular Na and water without a loss of K on a dry weight basis. In a series of studies in monkeys, Salmonella typhimurium sepsis was induced as an experimental model. Both patterns of muscle response to infection were detected. Electron probe microanalysis revealed that the loss of K concentration was due to an accumulation of intracellular saline which dilute the K content. The mechanism of this is unclear; however, a concomitant increase in undertermined osmoles in the serum suggests that there may be an increase in organic osmoles within the cell which leads to the dilution of intracellular K concentration."

Thymus grafts, which restore the T lymphocyte population of their lymphoid organs to nearly normal levels, lead to a considerable development of the Peyer's patches and of their germinal centers, assocaited with a considerable increase in gut IgA plasma cells, and in the serum IgA level. These findings are consistent with the postulated relationship between the Peyer's patches germinal center cells and the gut IgA plasma cells, and might help to explain the association of thymic defects, low serum IgA, and lack of intestinal IgA plasma cells observed in some immunodeficiency syndromes of man. Nude mice also have marked decrease in the number of lymphocytes present within the intestinal epithelium. These intraepithelial lymphocytes lymphocytes, which have been shown to be of T nature, are restored to normal numbers after thymus grafting."

Hearing thresholds were measured monaurally at 11 test frequencies ranging from 250 to 10000 Hz before, during, and after exposure. Temporary threshold shift (TTS) reached maximum levels at 8 to 12 hours of exposure. Maximum TTS occurred at 4 and 6 kHz. Mean asymptomtic threshold shifts (ATS) resulting from the 80 dB exposure level were 9.3 dB for 4 kHz and 7.2 dB for 6 kHz. For the 85 dB noise level, these threshold shifts were 17.8 dB and 14.6 dB respectively. The increase in ATS with increase of noise level for these two frequencies could be fitted with a straight line having a slope of 1.6."

In 21 (67%) of 31 individuals studied with non-heparin-coated catheters, either cell aggregations or thrombi developed compared with seven (28%) of 25 individuals studied with heparin-coated catheters. The median size of the cell aggregations and thrombi on non-heparin- and heparin-coated catheters was significantly different ( < 0.01). The slopes that estimated the probable rate of thrombus formation were also significantly different ( < 0.01). This suggests the desirability of replacement of non-heparin-coated catheters if the angiographic procedure is extended."

It was desirable to determine if a similar effect--more killing and mutation in N2 than in O2--could be observed with two other known alkylating agents, beta-propiolactone (BPL) and ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS), in the same test system. Conidia of a heterokaryotic strain of N. crassa were bubbled with N2 or O2 during treatment with BPL or EMS. Forward-mutation was measured in the ad-3 region by a direct method. The results indicate that N2 or O2 do not influence the lethal and mutagenic activities of BPL or EMS during treatment of conidia. Hence the influence of N2 or O2 on the lethal and mutagenic activites of ICR-170 is different from the influence of these gases on BPL or EMS using the ad-3 test system in N. crassa."

Eighteen to 20-year-olds experienced increases of at least 4600 additonal traffic crashes associated with alcohol of which at least 89 involved one or more fatalities in the 1972-1975 time period. Associated with the increase in crash involvement, draught beer consumption in Michigan dramatically increased. In the absence of any convincing explanations to the contrary, we consider these conservative analyses to be compelling evidence of the role of alcohol availability in the social etiology of alcohol-related traffic casualties."

        "abstract": "A study that lacks a definite design lacks direction and is defeated before it starts. Careful study design, however, is not the only indication of a successful audit. Approaching variation analysis in a positive rather than punitive manner enhances the committee's ability to recognize important findings and discover imaginative uses for audit data. When problems in care are revealed through evaluation activities, the committee must make recommendations that are appropriate to the causes of the problem and that can be readily implemented. An audit committee that discharges these responsibilities will produce a study that should surely yield informative data. The committee's ultimate goal--improved patient care--can not be far behind."

        "abstract": "Lymphocytes from 103 Holstein cattle were tested with 11 antilymphocytotoxic sera. Four of these sera were produced by whole blood immunization; these generally yielded lymphocytotoxicity against a large number of animals in each test panel. The majority of the sera were collected from parous cows which had never been immunized. Observations about this latter group of sera are (1) lymphocyte antibodies, may occur by alloimmunization in foetal-maternal interaction, (2) normal sera from non-immunized parous cows generally had a narrower specificity of antibodies than from parous cows immunized with blood from unrelated animals and in some cases these antisera may be monospecific, and (3) these sera from parous cows are easy to obtain without the need for laborious immunizations. Analysis of these lymphocytotoxic sera indicate several reagents were obtained which possessed different antibodies; these were useful in detecting polymorphism of cattle lymphocyte antigens. Using these 11 sera, an analysis of the reactions patterns among 103 Holsteins, including parent-offspring data resulted in the postulation of several alleles. These data suggest that cattle lymphocyte antigens are very polymorphic and inherited."

A new electrical device was constructed which eliminates the defects in earlier designs. The new equipment consists of a U-shaped handgrip transducer, a measuring device, and a slave monitor for the patients. The patient's maximum handgrip force is determined as a peak voltage, which is stored in analog form. Two comparators help to set the desired handgrip force during the actual testing. The slave monitor's two lamps and analog meter help the patient to apply a force which is maintained at a selected percentage of the maximum force. The device has been shown to operate well in a longitudinal study of drug treatment of hypertension."

        "abstract": "Most of the effects of vitamin D on calcium and phosphorus homeostasis result from an increase in intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphorus and from bone mobilization. These effects are due to 1,25(OH)2D3, one of the renal vitamin D metabolites. Besides ionic mobilization, vitamin D may exert additional effects on bone which depend on metabolites other than 1,25(OH)2D3. Kidneys, parathyroid glands and muscle are probably target organs for vitamin D. The metabolite(s) responsible for these actions remain unknown."

        "article_title": "Myocardial effects of lithium in vitro.",
        "abstract": "The myocardial effects of increasing concentrations of ionic lithium were investigated in isolated, spontaneously beating rabbit hearts, which were retrogradely perfused with a modified Krebs-Henseleit solution containing lithium in concentration of 1, 5 or 10 mM. The following functional parameters were continuously recorded: heart rate, amplitude and rate of contraction, coronary flow, myocardial oxygen consumption and ECG. The lowest concentration of 1 mM lithium did not cause any measurable changes in these parameters. A concentration of 5 mM lithium produced a rather slowly developed increase in amplitude and rate of contraction of about 22% without any concomitant increase of oxygen consumption. A delayed increase in the oxygen consumption of about 21%, but accompanied by a significant decrease in contractility however, occurred much later in the experiments, probably as an expression of a decrease in myocardial efficiency. The highest lithium concentration produced similar effects. None of the other parameters measured were markedly influenced by lithium. The positive inotropic effect of lithium on myocardial contractility was very convincingly verified in isolated electrically stimulated rabbit papillary muscles by isometric measurements of the maximum tension produced and the rate of its development. An inhibitory influence of lithium on the positive inotropic effect of increasing frequency of stimulation was observed. Adrenergic beta-receptor blockade did not abolish the positive inotropic effect of lithium. A possible causative influence of lithium on the cellular calcium metabolism is discussed."

Sixty-nine cases of phenylketonuria (PKU), 42 cases of histidinaemia, and six cases of homocystinuria were detected. As well as treating affected children, the staff of the unit have concentrated on providing full support for their families and maintaining good communications with parents, general practitioners, health visitors, and midwives. A clinic liaison sister has provided valuable support for health visitors and an important link between the unit and community services. A study of the costs of screening and treating cases of PKU for the year 1978 showed that this was cheaper, by pound 569000, than the costs of looking after patients with untreated PKU."

        "abstract": "The effects of cholera toxin on the responses of cultured Sertoli cells were compared with those elicited by follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and N6O2'-dibutyryl-3',5'-cyclic AMP (bu2cAMP). Addition of FSH or cholera toxin increased cAMP levels. Subsequently there was greater rates of conversion of testosterone to 17beta-estradiol, formation of androgen-binding protein (ABP), and incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA by Sertoli cells prepared from testes of immature rats and cultured in the presence of either FSH or cholera toxin. Addition of bu2-cAMP also resulted in enhanced rates of formation of ABP, synthesis of 17beta-estradiol and synthesis of DNA. Cholera toxin and bu2-cAMP elicited changes in morphology of cultured Sertoli cells indistinguishable from those following FSH addition. It is concluded that elevated intracellular cAMP levels can duplicate known actions of FSH on cultured Sertoli cells, but the possible obligatory role of cAMP in mediating FSH actions remains to be evaluated."

        "abstract": "Sympathetic chain ganglia of newborn rats were cultured in Rose chambers and their structure was registered, examined and photographed with a phase contrast microscope. When 0.5% (v/v) (86 mM) ethanol was present in the culture medium from the start of culture, the nerve cell bodies appeared similar to those in control cultures for at least a week and there was a normal outgrowth of a nerve fibre network. Higher concentrations had a progessively deleterious effect, 1% (171 mM) ethanol causing the appearance of degenerating cells and 2% (343 mM) ethanol killing all the nerve cells in 4 days. Some nerve cells survived 4 days in the presence of 1.5% (275 mM) ethanol in the culture medium, although most cells died in 2 days. When ethanol was added to cultures grown for 7 days in a control medium, concentration of 0.5% ethanol in the medium had no apparent effect, while most nerve cells died within a week in 1% ethanol, and all cells were dead already after 24 hours in 2% ethanol. It is concluded that ethanol exhibits a remarkably low toxicity towards living nerve cells."

Reliable conclusions may be drawn on the basis of an objective examination of the conductability of the injured nerve only. The duration of nerve regeneration ranges widely in conformity with the type and severity degree of the injury and depending on the results of the operation. Unsuccessful surgical interventions on the nerves are usually concerned with a severe type of an injury. Repeated operations on the nerves carried out to correct an earlier failure are not infrequently difficult to perform and have poorer results than the primary ones, even when the latters are delayed for several months. The greater number of errors happen when primary nerve suture is performed in a non-specialized medical establishment."

Authentic biofeedback was then provided for control of heart rate. Subjects were administered pre- and post-locus of control scales using Levenson's multidimensional scales. A significant relationship between locus of control and success or failure conditions added validity to Levenson's approach. Results and future research are discussed."

Species and even strain specificities were observed in these precipitin reactions. Multiple antigens were detected in the extracts from some strains, whereas only one precipitin band per extract developed during agar-gel diffusion tests of others. The antigen extracts were found to be both heat stable and resistant to hydrolysis by alpha-chymotrypsin. Four serological patterns were demonstrated in homologous and heterologous reactions with the B. fragilis. antigen-antibody systems used. The results showed that some strains were serologically distinct from others, indicating that the strains tested are of more than one serotype."

        "abstract": "Balb/c/nu nude mice transplanted with a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma were injected intraperitoneally with different doses of aqueous skin extracts containing the epidermal G2 chalone. The mitotic counts and the mitotic rates were determined in histological sections using a stathmokinetic method with vinblastine sulphate. The mitotic duration was calculated from the mitotic rates and counts. Skin extracts containing epidermal G2 chalone increased the mitotic duration in the epidermis, and a similar trend was seen in the tumour. The higher the dose of chalone, the longer the mitotic duration tended to be. A straight line of best fit used to indicate the dose/response relationship was steeper for the epidermis than for the tumour. The study thus shows that the epidermal G2 chalone not only prevents epidermal cells from entering mitosis, it also prolongs the mitotic duration. Further, the results do not contradict the theory that tumour cells may be less sensitive to chalone than normal cells."

        "article_title": "Genetic analysis of the inter-relationship between plasmid replication and incompatibility.",
        "abstract": "The relationship between replication control and plasmid incompatibility has been investigated using a composite replicon, pPM1, which consists of the pSC101 plasmid ligated to another small multicopy plasmid, RSF1050. Since pPM1 can utilise the replication system of either of the two functionally distinct components, propagation of the composite plasmid can occur in the presence of a mutation of one of its moieties. Such mutants are detected by their inability to rescue the composite plasmid under conditions not permissive for replication of the other moiety. Mutations in incompatibility functions can be detected by the failure of the composite replicon to exclude co-existing plasmids carrying a replication system identical to the one on pPM1. The inability of the composite plasmid to replicate at 42 degrees in a host synthesizing temperature-sensitive DNA polymerase I, which is required by the RSF1050 replication system, was used to isolate pPM1 mutants defective in replication of the pSC101 component. Mutants defective in the incompatibility functions of pSC101 were obtained by selecting derivatives that allow the stable coexistence of a second pSC101 replicon in the same cell. Analysis of these two classes of mutants indicates that plasmids selected for defective pSC101 replication ability nervertheless retain pSC101 incompatibility. In contrast, plasmid mutants that have lost incompatibility functions were found always to be defective in replication ability."

        "abstract": "The differentiation of neuromuscular junctions of multiply innervated, slow anterior latissimus dorsi (ALD) and focally innervated, fast, posterior latissimus dorsi (PLD) muscles was studied in normal and curarized chick embryos. At 16 days of incubation, fibres of both muscles are contacted by several axon profiles, the number of which falls with age. In 18-day-old embryos individual endplates in ALD are usually contacted by three axon profiles, whereas in PLD, endplates are contacted only by a single large terminal profile. At this time, there is already a significant accumulation of cell organelles in the postsynaptic area. Treatment of embryos with curare during the 7th and 12th day of incubation delays the differentiation of the neuromuscular junction in both muscles. The paralysis dramatically affects the decrease of the number of axon profiles at individual endplates in both muscles. At 16 days the number of axon profiles was greater in embryos treated with curare than in the untreated controls. At 18 days when the number of axon profiles normally decreases, the endplates of both types of curarized muscles have an even greater number of axon profiles than at 16 days. Endplates in curarized PLD had up to 13 and in curarized ALD up to 12 axon profiles. The effects of curare gradually wore off and when the movements of the embryos again became more vigorous, the normal differentiation of neuromuscular junctions continued. At 21 days of incubation many embryos recover from curare and show endplates of normal appearance in both muscles. These results suggest that activity of the muscle is essential for the maturation of the neuromuscular junctions."

The described antigen was revealed in some (not all) adenocarcinomas of the stomach; it differs from carcinoembryonic Gold's antigen and from the secretory IgA component, it is not a structural component of D-type oncornoviruses (of primates) produced by Hep-2 cells, and does not seem to be coded by the genom of this virus."

There was no ultrastructural features that could have been used as a basis for malignancy grading. The results show that electron microscopy has nothing to add to the nuclear grading system of renal adenocarcinoma and the value of this grading system is to be emphasized."

The tendon usually ruptures close to the distal edge of the retinaculum extensorum where it is vulnerable in various respects and in addition exposed to increased mechanical strain. Functional loss of the extensor pollicis longus greatly impairs the function of the entire hand and requires surgical therapy. Transfer of the extensor indicis tendon has proven successful in 95% and thus appears to be the most appropriate therapeutic procedure."

        "abstract": "Quantitative methods for determination of amoxicillin in body fluids are described. They comprise separation by reversed-phase chromatography (LiChrosorb RP-8, 5 micron) of the aqueous supernatants obtained from plasma or urine after purification steps involving protein precipitation followed by extraction in the case of plasma, or a double extraction procedure in the case of urine, post-column derivatization with air segmentation, and finally measurement of the UV absorbance at 310 nm. The derivatization involves formation of the mercuric mercaptide of penicillenic acid and is specific for compounds with an intact penicillanic acid ring system. Detection limits achieved on injecting 200 microliter of plasma and 20 microliter of urine are about 25 ng/ml and 200 ng/ml, respectively, but it is possible to improve the sensitivity further by injecting larger volumes. Precisions (srel) obtained for determination of 0.10 and 0.45 migrogram/ml in plasma were 3.72 and 1.40%, respectively. Some problems regarding column stability originating from the injection of biological samples are discussed."

The clinical manifestations are generally the consequence of bronchial erosion and blocking. Bronchial endoscopy is the essential examination which allows the tumour to be seen and a biopsy to be made. Pathological examination confirms the diagnosis. The typicall cell of granular cell tumour is a large, polygonal one with finely granular eosinophilic cytoplasm and a small dark vesicular nucleus. Such cells are arranged in syncytial masses containing long, spindleshape cells with elongated nuclei. If the optical and elctron microscope description is well known, the histogenesis of the disease is still in dispute; the neurogenic origin seems to be the best one, but at present there is not enough evidence to make this assumption a certainty. Surgical exeresis is the only therapy to bring about a cure, but clinical supervision is necessary because of a possible relapse."

Antihaemophilic globulin (factor VIII) and pro-accelerin (factor V) in particular lose their activities so quickly that only very few activities still remain after a storage period of 3-5 days. In connection with existing primary diseases but also in trauma and shock a dilution-coagulopathy caused by insufficient supply of factors VIII and V can develop during massive transfusion, and this especially with banked blood already stored over a longer period of time. Therapy of this disturbance of coagulation consists of substituting the missing coagulation factors under heparin protection."

In the present study we examined the relative efficacy of rating and testing approaches for predicting criterion behavior. Three tests from the Social and Prevocational Information Battery were selected as a foundation for the development of analogous behavior-rating and applied-performance instruments. All three types of instruments were administered to the same subjects, mildly retarded adolescents, in order to estimate the validity of testing and rating approaches. Although both approaches were found to be valid, the testing approach appeared to be substantially superior. Implications of this finding were discussed briefly."

Using the single-injection indicator diffusion method (6, 28), myocardial extractions (E), capillary clearances (C), and permeability surface area products (PS) of urea, sucrose, and inulin were measured in intact, pump-perfused, working hearts of anesthetized dogs. Both types of cardiac hypertrophy were associated with a decreased coronary vascular resistance. Myocardial E, C, and PS values from the exercised group were not significantly different from control. Dogs with pathological hypertrophy exhibited increased central venous pressures, RVEDP's, and heart rates which were greater than control values. The E, C, and PS values from the pathologically hypertrophied hearts were significantly greater than control. These increases in myocardial transcapillary exchange can be explained either by increasing the equivalent pore radius of myocardial capillary membranes from a control value of 70 to 100 A or by assuming that pathologically hypertrophied hearts have a myocardial capillary surface area available for exchange which is twice that of control hearts."

        "abstract": "In a rural 116-bed skilled nursing facility, a study was made of the influence of a Consultant Pharmacist on drug usage over a one-year period. Lines of communication were established with the six attending physicians by means of work rounds, telephone calls, and both official and unofficial memoranda. Daily pharmacy rounds were conducted with health-care students and the nursing supervisor, who facilitated physician-pharmacist communication. The physician-nurse-pharmacist team studied each patient's problems, the status of the therapeutic endpoint, and the need of and usage of each regularly scheduled or pro re nata (PRN) drug. Stop-order and standing-order protocols were developed. During the one-year period, the number of regularly scheduled drugs per patient was reduced from 3.30 to 2.66 (19.4 percent decrease), and of PRN drugs from 3.92 to 2.12 (45.9 percent decrease). The overall significant reduction was associated with the protocol and stop-order discontinuances of routinely scheduled drugs, and with the duplicated orders for drugs to relieve pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, colds and cough. Implications for optimal care of the patients, and for the economics of this federally-mandated system of consultant pharmacists are discussed."

Ten acute schizophrenic patients were included in a double-blind, crossover trial of paracetamol and a placebo, in which each treatment was given for a week. Regular 4-hourly temperatures were recorded in all these cases and in 5 non-schizophrenic patients for comparison. The findings provided no evidence that paracetamol mitigated the symptoms of schizophrenia. The temperatures of the schizophrenics were not elevated more than those of the controls, but the number of cases used was probably too small for this finding to be conclusive."

Analysis of sociodemographic variables showed that the effect of ethnic density on risk for psychiatric hospitalization cannot be accounted for by differences in poverty, family cohesiveness, or population mobility."

        "abstract": "Messenger RNA activities for two cortisol-inducible enzymes, tyrosine aminotransferase and tryptophan oxygenase, have been determined by translation in a wheat germ system. The effects of cycloheximide on the two mRNA activities have been evaluated. Cortisol leads to an increase of the translatable mRNAs for tyrosine aminotransferase and tryptophan oxygenase with a maximum at approximately 6 h. Cycloheximide was administered 4 h after treatment with cortisol; 2 h later, the activities of tyrosine aminotransferase and tryptophan oxygenase mRNA had increased five-fold and two-fold, respectively, compared to the activities reached with cortisol alone. Thereafter the amount of the two translatable mRNAs declined, though 14 h after cortisol administration the mRNA activities were still several fold higher than in control animals. Application of alpha-amanitin together with cycloheximide did not prevent an increased accumulation of specific translatable mRNAs. The increase in tyrosine aminotransferase and tryptophan oxygenase activity by cortisol was immediately blocked by cycloheximide. Whereas tryptophan oxygenase activity rapidly declined after cycloheximide application, tyrosine aminotransferase activity remained at the same level. Approximately 4 h thereafter, both enzyme activities increased again."

        "abstract": "L-Alanyl-L-tyrosine and glycyl-L-phenylalanine labelled with 14C competed with each other and with the dipeptide antibiotic bacilysin for transport into Staphylococcus aureus NCTC 6571 in a medium which did not support growth. They also competed with other dipeptides and several tripeptides. The fast initial transport ofthe two labelled peptides appeared to show Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Neither was transported into a bacilysin-resistant mutant of S. aureus NCTC 6571, although tyrosine was taken up by the mutant as readily as it was by the parent strain. Uptake of alanyltyrosine or glycylphenylalanine was followed by rapid hydrolysis of the peptide and the excretion of tyrosine or phenylalanine. Glycine liberated from glycylphenylalanine was partly degraded and partly incorporated into the bacterial wall. The behaviour of these dipeptides paralleled the inactivation of bacilysin by suspensions of S. aureus and the appearance of its C-terminal amino acid, anticapsin, in the extracellular fluid."

        "abstract": "To discover the prevalence of chronic respiratory disease and the various factors associated with it, 1162 men (85% of the defined population) aged 25 to 69 years were surveyed using a questionnaire, chest radiograph and spirometry. 112 men with pulmonary tuberculosis or \"other respiratory disease\" were excluded from the analysis. Excluding the youngest age group (25 to 39 years), the smokers were thinner than the non-smokers. The percentages of overweight men among the non-smokers, ex-smokers and smokers were 22%, 27% and 14%, respectively (P less than 0.001). Almost all respiratory symptoms were more common in the smokers than in the non-smokers, and the prevalence of cough, phlegm, severe breathlessness and the effect of weather on respiratory symptoms significantly increased with age. Asthma was not associated with age or smoking, nor was socioeconomic status associated with chronic respiratory disease. The ventilatory function, measured by FEV1, FVC and FEV%, was worse in the smokers than in the non-smokers. In addition the slope of FEV% on age was significantly steeper in the ex-smokers and the various groups of smokers than in the non-smokers."

Both lymphocytes and macrophages were found within spheroids at the time of peak tumor cell damage. Cytotoxic cells specific for allograft antigens were also present. Using a short-term 51-Cr release assay, the cells responsible for cytotoxicity were characterized as a nonadherent, nonphagocytic T cell population. Velocity sedimentation cell separation further demonstrated that these cytotoxic cells had the physical properties of small lymphocytes. Some evidence for selective spheroid infiltration by specifically alloimmune cells was also obtained. The possible relationship of this cellular infiltrate to graft damage is discussed."

At physiological concentration alpha 2 M has been found to inhibit mitogenic as well as antigenic stimulation. However at lower dilutions alpha 2 M acts in synergy either with the mitogen or with the antigen. At these dilutions thymidine incorporation is enhanced. alpha 2 M has no toxic or mitogenic effect on normal human lymphocytes. These data might indicate that two proteases may play a role in the proliferation of normal human lymphocytes."

When neuromuscular transmission was blocked with high Mg2+ or with curare, X-537A markedly increased the end-plate potential (e.p.p.) amplitude. Then a few minutes later the e.p.p. disappeared. 3. When neuromuscular transmission was blocked with hypertonic saline solution, X-537A did not increase e.p.p. amplitude; it did produce many transmission failures. 4. X-537A decreased the depolarization of the end-plate produced by iontophoretically applied ACh. this may account in part for the disappearance of the e.p.p. in solutions containing the ionophore. 5. X-537A depolarized muscle fibres by about 15 mV. 6. When the extracellular divalent cation concentration was very low, X-537A had little or no effect on miniature end-plate potential (min.e.p.p.) frequency. 7. When a divalent cation was present in the extracellular fluid, X-537A increased the frequency of the min.e.p.p.s. The sequence of effectiveness of the divalent ions we have tested is: Ba2+ greater than Sr2+ greater than Ca2+ greater than Mn2+ congruent to Co2+ congruent to Ni2+ greater than Mg2+. There is a rough parallel between these results and the reported affinity of X-537A for various divalent ions. 8. The increase in min.e.p.p. frequency caused by X-537A was transitory, following the increase min.e.p.p. frequency fell to a very low rate or to zero. Then nerve stimulation did not cause quantal release. A second application of X-537A was without effect. 9. X-537A decreased min.e.p.p. amplitude, in accord with the effect on the sensitivity of the end-plate to ACh. 10. The results support the idea that increases in intracellular divalent cation concentrations trigger quantal release from nerve terminals and are involved in the disensitization of end plate receptors to ACh."

        "abstract": "Active transport of pyridoxine, pyridoxal, and pyridoxamine occurs in resting cells of Saccharomyces carlsbergensis 4228 and can lead to intracellular concentrations of free vitamin much higher than those supplied externally. The initial Km for pyridoxine uptake is 3.6 x 10(-7) M at 30 degrees and pH 4.5, which are optimum for growth. Transport is inhibited by many unphosphorylated vitamin analogs, the most effective being 5'-deoxypyridoxine, 5'-deoxypridoxal, toxopyrimidine, 4'-deoxypyridoxine, and 3-amino-3-deoxypyridoxine. Two distinct uptake systems that differ in structural specificity and ionic requirements are present. One, with optimum pH of 3.5, transports pyridoxal effectively, but not pyridoxamine; the other (optimum pH 6.0) transports pyridoxamine effectively, but not pyridoxal. Both systems transport pyridoxine, while neither transports pyridoxal 5'-phosphate. Other properties of these systems are similar, indicating that they share certain elements in common. An initial temperature optimum of 30 degrees is observed for pyrodoxine transport and, at this temperature, an \"overshoot\" in intracellular vitamin levels, with subsequent decrease to a constant level, occurs with time. It appears that intracellular vitamin, or a derivative, activates the exit mechanism for the vitamin. Exit rates also depend on the resuspension buffer and are increased in the presence of glucose and decreased by azide. Above 30 degrees net uptake of pyridoxine drops initially, then rapidly increases to a second optimum at 50 degrees; the uptake system is inactivated at about 55 degrees. The optimum at 50 degrees apparently results from activation of inflow as exit is rapid and is accelerated by azide. No overshoot was detected at 50 degrees, so it appears that the exit system is not regulated by intracellular vitamin at this temperature. A phase transition in membrane lipids occurs at 30 degrees and may be responsible for the change in properties of the inflow and exit mechanisms above this temperature."

An apparent effect of insulin administration on enlargement of interscapular brown adipose tissue (BAT) was found in heat-exposed rats, but not in warm-adapted or cold-acclimated rats. 2. BAT extracts from the heat-acclimated/insulin-treated (HI) rats notably increased the capillary growth in an in vitro angiogenesis model in which microvascular fragments and myofibroblastic (Mf) cells isolated from lipid tissues were grown in co-culture, although a direct effect of insulin was not high. 3. BAT extracts from the HI rats stimulated the production of endothelial cell growth factor and collagen by Mf cells. 4. It is probable that an increased angiogenic activity contributes to the capillary growth and tissue growth in BAT of HI rats."

        "abstract": "Several studies indicate that active oxygen species play an important role in the development of pulmonary disease (asbestosis and silicosis) after exposure to mineral dust. The present study was conducted to determine if inhaled fibrogenic minerals induced changes in gene expression and activities of antioxidant enzymes (AOE) in rat lung. Two different fibrogenic minerals were compared, crocidolite, an amphibole asbestos fiber, and cristobalite, a crystalline silicon dioxide particle. Steady-state mRNA levels, immunoreactive protein, and activities of selected AOE were measured in lungs 1-10 days after initiation of exposure and at 14 days after cessation of a 10-day exposure period. Exposure to asbestos resulted in significant increases in steady-state mRNA levels of manganese-containing superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) at 3 and 9 days and of glutathione peroxidase at 6 and 9 days. An increase in steady-state mRNA levels of copper, zinc-containing superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD), was observed at 6 days. Exposure to asbestos also resulted in overall increased enzyme activities of catalase, glutathione peroxidase and total superoxide dismutase in lung. In contrast, silica caused a dramatic increase in steady-state levels of MnSOD mRNA at all time periods and an increase in glutathione peroxidase mRNA levels at 9 days. Activities of AOE remained unchanged in silica-exposed lungs. In both models, increases in gene expression of MnSOD correlated with increased amounts of MnSOD immunoreactive protein in lung and the pattern and extent of inflammation. These data indicate that the profiles of AOE are dissimilar during the development of experimental asbestosis or silicosis and suggest different mechanisms of lung defense in response to these minerals."

No overlap of arylsulphatase A activity was observed between peripheral leukocytes obtained from 11 normal donors, 8 heterozygotes and 5 homozygotes for MLD. Absence of enzyme activity was demonstrated in the patients' leukocytes, when the modified assay procedure was employed. Arylsulphatase A activity (mean +/- S.D.) in 30 lymphoid lines and sublines established from 18 normal donors, 2 heterozygotes and 1 homozygote for MLD was 54-5 +/- 23-1, 24-1 +/- 3-2 and 0-9, respectively. The enzymic activity of arylsulphatase A and B remained stable over a period of several months. These findings indicate that long-term lymphoid lines express the genotype of the donor and maintain enzyme stability over long periods in culture. Moreover, it appears that peripheral leukocytes are a reliable system for the identification of the carrier state of MLD."

Blood samples were obtained from proestrus rats immediately before and 20 min after injection of exogenous hormones or initiation of stress procedures, and plasma concentrations of 3 alpha-Adiol and/or progesterone (P) were measured in these samples by RIA. Intravenous injections of ovine LH (5, 15, or 45 micrograms) or saline resulted in equivalent significant increases in plasma 3 alpha-Adiol 20 min after injection. In contrast, dose-dependent increases in 3 alpha-Adiol were seen after intravenous injection of 0 (acidic saline vehicle), 2, 4, or 8 ng ACTH1-24 to dexamethasone-pretreated rats. The highest ACTH1-24 dose also resulted in a significant increase in plasma P concentration. In a third experiment, a significant increase in 3 alpha-Adiol concentration above baseline was seen at 20 min after onset of restraint stress; in this case plasma P concentrations did not increase significantly. Finally, blood samples were obtained after onset of ether/jugular venipuncture stress two days after ovariectomy (ovx), adrenalectomy (adx), or ovx+adx on diestrus. The plasma 3 alpha-Adiol response to stress was normal in intact sham-operated and non-operated groups of controls, but was significantly diminished in the ovx and the adx groups to 28.4% of that shown by the intact animals. Circulating 3 alpha-Adiol concentrations were undetectable in 22/26 samples obtained in the ovx+adx group. These data demonstrate that plasma concentrations of 3 alpha-Adiol increase in response to stress or ACTH but not LH, and that both the ovary and the adrenal contribute to this increase."

        "abstract": "The uterine luteal phase in T. vulpecula is not dependent upon the secretions of the CL throughout its duration. Ablation of the CL or ovariectomy after Day 7 of the 26-day oestrous cycle does not result in the termination of the uterine secretory phase. The dependence of the luteal phase on the secretions of the CL is demonstrated by ablation of the CL or ovariectomy on Days 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 of the oestrous cycle. Ablation of the CL before Day 8 resulted in the inhibition of the impending luteal phase, and the commencement of a follicular phase resulting in oestrus 8 to 9 days later. Removal of the CL or ovariectomy on Days 8 or 12 does not completely inhibit the uterine luteal phase since sufficient precursor of uterine milk is stored in the uterine basal glandular epithelium, thus enabling the endometrium to maintain the secretion of uterine milk."

        "abstract": "Measurements of forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), FEV1/FVC ratio, functional residual capacity (FRC), total lung capacity (TLC), residual volume (RV), and RV/TLC ratio have been made in 331 normal Cantonese subjects (134 male and 197 female). The results have been expressed in multiple regression equations relating the volumes to age, height, and weight and have been compared with those of other workers. Lung volumes obtained in this study are in general lower for Chinese subjects than those reported for Caucasians. Similar findings for FVC were reported by Chuan and Chia (1969) in Singapore and by Wu and Yang (1962) in Taiwan. Significant differences, however, are noted for FRC, TLC, RV, and RV/TLC between our findings and those of Chuan and Chia. Our series is unbalanced because of an uneven distribution of age groups. In fact in none of the reported studies on Chinese subjects, including that of da Costa (1971), is the series large or balanced. Clearly, further research is required in this ethnic group to get more reliable predictive formulae for lung volumes."

Sodium thiosulfate had a small, but statistically significant (P less than .05) protective effect against death due to sodium sulfide, whether the mice were maintained under air or oxygen. Pretreatment with sodium nitrite, however, increased the acute intraperitoneal lethal dose for 50% survival of the group (LD50) of sodium sulfide 2.5 times. Neither oxygen, thiosulfate, nor the combination potentiated the protective effects of nitrite against sulfide poisoning. Antidotal effects of nitrite in acute sulfide poisoning were demonstrated in rats. The therapeutic efficacy of nitrite in acute poisoning is clearly superior to that of oxygen, which is the more widely recommended antidote."

The implicated rabbits were later recovered from the patient's freezer, and Yersinia pestis was isolated from marrows of both rabbits. Although human plague cases in the United States have occasionally been traced to exposure to wild rabbits, this is the first documentation of plague infection in the actual rabbits to which the patient was exposed. All reported cases of rabbit-associated plague in the United States were then reviewed. Eight cases were characterized by direct exposure to rabbit tissues. Seven of the eight cases occurred in adult males who had hunted rabbits during winter months in plague-endemic areas. These patients had upper extremity buboes, and the case-fatality ration for the group was 50%. Three other cases in which rabbit exposure was indirect or its role less clear, were also analyzed."

In the tissues studied and in the tumor the LDH type was not altered in the course of development of the tumor. At the same time the LDH activity was slightly decreased in muscles; in the terminal period it was increased in liver tissue; in ascitic cells or fluid it was increased in the course of development of the tumor. In blood serum the M-fraction was the main type of LDH. The M4 isozyme accounted for about 80% of the total LDH activity. The remainding 20% were distributed approximately equally between the other four isozymes. As the disease proceeded redistribution of isozymes occurred in the direction of the M-type. About 70% of the H-type LDH was found in heart; isozymes H4 and H3M accounted for about 35% each of the total LDH-activity. Direct relation was not observed between the alteration in the enzymatic activity and the LDH isozyme spectrum in tumor and tissues of animals with developing Ehrlich ascites tumor."

The test became positive in 39 of 42 splenectomised calves and two of six intact cattle tested during acute infections. Haematological studies during the course of infection in two splenectomised and six intact cattle indicated that a positive PST was reliable evidence for intravascular coagulation. Of four splenectomised and one intact cattle that were positive to the test and were subsequently autopsied, all had histopathological changes indicative of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). It was concluded that the PST could be used as a screening test for DIC in acute bovine babesiosis."

In contrast to cells grown on planar surfaces under static or steady laminar flow conditions, cells exposed to higher levels of turbulent agitation do not form actin stress fibers. Greater agitation also leads to a more diffuse appearance of the mitochondria and a wider distribution of them throughout the cytoplasm. This response may indicate damaged mitochondria, as similar results have been reported for chemical toxins."

We report 2 cases presenting with high traumatic aneurysms, following motorcycle accidents. The 2 aneurysms underwent repair by a venous graft. The petrous portion of the carotid artery was approached and controlled by an ENT surgeon. This \"infratemporal\" approach was used exposing the facial nerve, combined with temporary anterior sub-luxation of the temporomaxillary joint to expose the lower part of the carotid canal which was opened up with a drill in order to control the carotid artery in the petrous canal. Both patients developed facial nerve palsies which improved within 3 months. Postoperative angiography showed patent vein grafts and the patients were doing well, without any symptoms 18 and 24 months later."

        "abstract": "The regulated secretory pathway comprises accelerated discharge of proteins in response to hormonal stimuli, their presence in secretory granules (SG), and a long intracellular residence time. Dexamethasone induction of AR42J results in an increase in granule content and responsiveness to cholecystokinin (CCK). We studied the effects of conditions implicated in sorting of secretory proteins into the regulated pathway using [35S]methionine pulse-chase protocols that examine transport of secretory proteins from the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER)----SG and specifically from the Golgi complex (GC)----SG. The latter uses a chase at 20 degrees C to allow accumulation of labeled proteins in the trans-Golgi, followed by a shift to 37 degrees C that initiates their transport to SG under test conditions. Quantitation of CCK-8-stimulated discharge of prestored amylase and of newly synthesized labeled proteins that have entered SG during the chase enables us to examine the effect of perturbants over selected parts of the pathway. The effects of acidic intracellular compartments, the cytoskeleton, protein synthesis, ATP, and temperature on pre- and post-Golgi entry of proteins into the regulated pathway were studied. NH4Cl, monensin, Na azide, incubation at 20 degrees C, and pertussis toxin retarded RER----SG transport without affecting amylase discharge. Only incubation with 20 mM NH4Cl or 1 microM monensin inhibited transfer of newly synthesized proteins from the late GC----SG. RER----Golgi or intra-Golgi transport thus appears to require ATP and possibly guanosine 5'-triphosphate (GTP)-binding proteins. Acidic compartments appear to be essential for sorting of secretory proteins from the GC----SG."

Although its calculated molecular mass is 131 kDa, IRS-1 from quiescent cells migrated between 165 and 170 kDa during sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. IRS-1 was phosphorylated strongly on serine residues and weakly on threonine residues before insulin stimulation. Insulin immediately stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, and after 10-30 min with insulin its apparent molecular mass increased to 175-180 kDa. Expression of the human insulin receptor and rat IRS-1 together in CHO/IR/IRS-1 cells increased the basal serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and strongly increased tyrosine phosphorylation during insulin stimulation. Purified insulin receptors directly phosphorylated baculovirus-produced IRS-1 exclusively on tyrosine residues. By immunofluorescence, IRS-1 was absent from the nucleus, but otherwise distributed uniformly before and after insulin stimulation. Some IRS-1 associated with the insulin receptor during insulin stimulation. In addition, a phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase associated with IRS-1 during insulin stimulation, and this association was more sensitive to insulin in CHO cells overexpressing the insulin receptor (CHO/IR cells), more responsive to insulin to CHO/IRS-1 cells, and both sensitive and responsive in CHO/IR/IRS-1 cells. Similarly, insulin-stimulated DNA synthesis was more sensitive to insulin in CHO/IR cells, and more responsive in CHO/IRS-1 cells; however, insulin-stimulated DNA synthesis was sensitive but poorly responsive to insulin in CHO/IR/IRS-1 cells. Together, these results suggest that IRS-1 is a direct physiologic substrate of the insulin receptor and may play an important role in insulin signal transmission."

        "abstract": "To test the desensitization hypothesis of cardiac beta-adrenergic receptors (beta-AR) in chronic hypoxia, the effect of 1, 3, 7, 15, and 21 days of exposure to hypobaric hypoxia (380 Torr) was evaluated in Wistar rats. Exposure to hypoxia for 1-15 days did not induce any change in right and left ventricular beta-AR density (Bmax) determined with [125I]iodocyanopindolol or in antagonist affinity. After 21 days, Bmax decreased by 24% in the left ventricle. In contrast, no change in beta-AR was shown in the right hypertrophied ventricle. Agonist affinity in the left ventricle was not altered, as shown by the analysis of displacement curves of isoproterenol (normoxia 185 +/- 26 nM, hypoxia 170 +/- 11 nM). Moreover, there was no significant decrease in adenylate cyclase activity (pmol.mg-1.min-1) in the left ventricle. In the right ventricle, a 21-day exposure to hypoxia led to a decrease in basal and maximal activity when stimulated by isoproterenol. A decrease in tissue norepinephrine content was observed after 7 days of hypoxia. In conclusion, these data support the beta-AR downregulation hypothesis as one of the mechanisms of myocardial adaptation to high altitude occurring after 2-3 wk of exposure to hypoxia. The regulation pathways of beta-AR may differ between left nonhypertrophied and right hypertrophied ventricles. No evidence of profound abnormality of signal transduction was shown."

        "abstract": "The late results of early treatment of congenital dislocation of the hip in the von Rosen splint have been recorded in a follow-up study of 111 children with an average age of ten years (range eight to sixteen). The clinical diagnosis had been made within two days of birth and in most cases confirmed by radiological examination. Splintage was in all cases begun within the first few days and maintained for an average period of ten weeks. Two cases of failure of the initial treatment were encountered but had good final results. The follow-up study included a radiological examination in which were recorded the general configuration of the joint, the CE-angle described by Wiberg, the presence or absence of an os acetabuli and the roundness of the femoral head. The findings were compared with those in a control group of 222 normal children. All the treated hips developed normally except for a single case of minor dysplasia and a single case of slight enlargement of the femoral head and neck following appearances suggestive of avascular necrosis at the age of two years."

        "abstract": "Rapid steady-state estimates of interstitial fluid (ISF) adenosine concentrations (ADOi) in the left ventricular epicardium of anesthetized dogs were obtained by the epicardial porous disc (EPD) method described herein. Because of the high temporal and spatial resolution of this method, it was ideally suited to test the hypothesis that ADOi may vary in these domains. Variance in steady-state EPD solute concentrations was quantified statistically by the coefficient of variation (CV = standard deviation/mean), which we used as an index of heterogeneity. A significant temporal variation in steady-state EPD adenosine concentrations was observed when samples were sequentially collected from one epicardial location (CV = 42.9 +/- 3.5%). When steady-state sample pairs (n = 45) were collected simultaneously from two distinct epicardial locations, a 2.6 +/- 0.3-fold mean difference in their respective adenosine concentrations was measured. About 25% of this variation was inherent in procedural methodology, based on the variability of steady-state EPD concentrations of extracellularly-equilibrated 14C sucrose (CV = 12.7 +/- 1.2%) and the variability of steady-state concentrations of both solutes measured using in vitro preparations (mean CV = 9.7 +/- 1.2%). Thus, we contend that endogenous myocardial ISF adenosine is temporally and perhaps spatially heterogeneous. Our estimates of steady-state ADOi obtained with the EPD method ranged from 0.47 to 0.99 microM. Using modifications of the EPD technique and the epicardial chamber, we also demonstrated that the adenosine concentration in 'steady-state' epicardial samples is reduced when the volume/surface area ratio of the sample buffer is increased. We hypothesize that sampling-induced decreases in steady-state ADOi underlie these observations, because losses of ISF adenosine to high volumes of sample buffer can be greater than the myocardial cells are capable of replacing. However, with the very low volume/surface area ratio of a single EPD (7.5 microliters/cm2), steady-state ADOi may remain constant during sampling, allowing for accurate determinations of ADOi with this method."

The wandering spleen is quite vulnerable to the complication of torsion, which is seen most often as an acute abdominal emergency due to splenic infarction. A more unusual variant is chronic torsion which causes intermittent mild to moderate abdominal pain, gastrointestinal disturbances and, in one case, hypersplenism. A mass has been present in most cases and may be anywhere in the abdomen or pelvis. Splenectomy should be performed for all cases of wandering spleen with or without torsion."

        "abstract": "The mouse tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)-I gene was cloned, sequenced, and characterized. The nucleotide sequence analysis shows that the TNFR-I is composed of 10 exons and nine introns. The first intron includes two simple dinucleotide repeat sequences, (GA)8 and (TC)9(TG)19. The (TC)9(TG)19 tandem repeat was found to be polymorphic in its length among various mouse strains. The nucleotide sequence of the 1076 bp 5' flanking region of the TNFR-I was also determined. Various possible regulatory sequences were identified in the 5' flanking region of the TNFR-I gene. For functional analysis, the 5' flanking region of the TNFR-I gene was isolated, ligated upstream of the luciferase reporter gene, and transiently transfected into L929, Hela, and a T cell hybridoma cell line. The results show that the isolated 5' flanking region has functional promoter activity and is responsible for constitutive expression of the TNFR-I gene. A series of truncated promoter constructs were generated and studied in a transient transfection system. Analysis of transient expression in L929 cells shows that the regions -1076/-939, -615/-425, and -425/-198 include positive regulatory elements, while the region -939/-615 may contain negative cis-acting elements for the constitutive expression of the TNFR-I. The shortest construct containing 198 bp of the 5' flanking region still has significant promoter activity, suggesting that the two GC-rich elements in this region may play an important role in the constitutive expression of the TNFR-I gene."

        "abstract": "Impairment of sinus rhythm has been reported after the Mustard procedure for complete transposition. We observed two patients who developed severe bradycardia during or after exercise. The first had a 2.8 s sinus pause in the recovery period, the second had a drop in heart rate during exercise. Both eventually had a pacemaker implanted. Exercise testing can be helpful in detecting sick sinus syndrome."

        "abstract": "Influenza viral complementary RNA (cRNA), i.e., viral mRNA was radioactive when purified from the cytoplasmic fraction of cordycepin-treated canine kidney cells that were incubated with [methyl-3H]methionine during infection. Approximately 55 to 60% of the methyl-3H radioactivity was in internal N6-methyladenosine, a feature distinguishing this mRNA from those viral mRNA's that are known to be synthesized in the cytoplasm. The remaining methyl-3H radioactivity was in 5'-terminal cap structures that consisted of 7-methylguanosine in pyrophosphate linkage to 2'-o-methyladenosine, N6, 2'-O-dimethyladenosine, or 2'-O-methylguanosine. Methylated adenosine was the predominant penultimate nucleoside in caps, suggesting that cRNA synthesis in infected cells initiates preferentially with adenosine at the 5' end. In contrast to cRNA, influenza virion RNA segments extracted from purified virus contained mainly 5'-terminal ppA and no detectable cap structures."

        "abstract": "Whereas coronary angioplasty has been demonstrated to be unnecessary and perhaps harmful for most patients after successful thrombolytic treatment of acute myocardial infarction, the clinical benefit of rescue angioplasty after failed thrombolysis remains untested in a randomized clinical trial. However, in the clinical judgment of many physicians it is unethical to withhold such treatment, whereas a nearly equal number of physicians believe that such treatment cannot be justified. A review of reported nonrandomized data from a limited number of patients suggests that 1) coronary angioplasty is successful in only 80% of patients after failed thrombolysis, 2) later reocclusion rates may depend on the thrombolytic agent used, 3) left ventricular ejection fraction is seldom improved, and 4) mortality rates after successful angioplasty approximate those after successful thrombolysis alone but mortality rates after failed angioplasty are remarkably high. The arguments for and against rescue angioplasty are reviewed, and it is concluded that results of randomized trials are needed to replace disparate clinical opinion on whether this potentially costly form of therapy should be widely implemented."

        "abstract": "The effects of various carbon sources and of antibiotics on the morphology of hypha cells of the fungus Ustilago cynodontis is described. Nonfermentable substrates promote readily reversible yeastlike colonies from hypha cells: all the hypha cells spread on these substrates give rise to yeastlike colonies that revert to the mycelial phenotype when transferred to glucose medium. Among the antibiotics tested, chloramphenicol (CAP) is found to promote, under certain circumstances, a long-lasting, even permanent modification on the morphology of the colonies: the colonies developed on CAP-glucose media are yeastlike, and a percentage of them give rise to colonies whose morphology remains yeastlike even on drug-free media: this effect is also obtained with cells cultivated in liquid medium. This permanent morphological modification is accompanied by a change of metabolic properties. Similar permanent effects are obtained with ethidium bromide, suggesting that mitochondrial functioning is involved in these modifications."

        "article_title": "Formulation of goals for life expectancy at birth in Costa Rica (report of one experience).",
        "abstract": "Costa Rican authorities have finished a national adaptation of the goals of the Hemisphere's Ten-Year Health Plan for the Americas and have formulated a National Health Plan for 1974-1980. This work was coordinated by the Health Sector Planning Unit and was assisted by various multidisciplinary and multi-institutional working groups. The methodology set forth in this article was developed by a group responsible for formulating goals with regard to life expectancy--the last of five health-related subjects analyzed, and one regarded as dependent on the rest. In brief, this methodology was as follows: Birth rates, death rates, and life expectancy at birth in the other countries of the Region and in a developed country (Sweden) were compared with those prevailing now and in the past in Costa Rica. This served as a basis for projecting Costa Rica's future prospects if no changes were made, or if certain changes were made through implementation of new programs. This was followed by analysis of leading caused of death in the country--by age group and vulnerability of those dying, and by probably reductions in mortality that would result from achieving the goals established for other programs. On this basis, various alternative reductions in mortality for each age groups were considered. Using these alternative, abridged life tables were devised, and these in turn were used to draw up a table showing the life expectancy at birth that would result from realization of each alternative. This made it possible to derive life expectancy goals that were consistent with the goals for reducing mortality in each age group that were formulated during the sectoral planning process. It is hoped that this general procedure, illustrated here with data from the Costa Rican case, may prove useful to others engaged in health planning work."

        "abstract": "Electrical field stimulation (5 Hz) evoked a prompt outflow of calcitonin gene-related peptide- and substance P-like immunoreactivities (CGRP-LI and SP-LI, respectively) from superfused slices of the dorsal but not ventral half of the rat spinal cord. The evoked outflow was abolished by tetrodotoxin, calcium-free medium or previous exposure to capsaicin, indicating that it is produced through action potentials invading the central terminals of capsaicin-sensitive primary afferents. Adenosine as well as gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) or the GABAB receptor agonist (-)-baclofen produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of the evoked CGRP-LI outflow. Adenosine also inhibited the evoked SP-LI outflow. These findings demonstrate that inhibition of transmitter release from primary afferent neurons should be considered as a possible mechanism of the antinociceptive action of adenosine and adenosine analogs."

It consists of reverse transcription of total RNA using primers selective for 28S rRNA and the message of interest. Routinely the 28S reaction mix is diluted 20,000-fold and the dilution error is minimized by adding 10 microCi of 3H2O before the dilution and determining the level of 3H before and after the dilution. Aliquots from the diluted 28S mix and the undiluted reverse transcripts are co-amplified by PCR in the presence of 32P-dATP. The samples are analyzed by electrophoresis, bands detected by autoradiography and in each lane the ratio is determined between cpm in the band of interest and cpm in the 28S band. The ratio is a measure of the level of mRNA in the sample and can be used to monitor changes in mRNA during treatments, development and pathogenesis."

Children were scored for dental caries by means of the decayed, missing, filled teeth index (DMFT index). Frequent use of F toothpaste (toothbrushing frequency) is poorly linked to caries (Spearman r = 0.05, P = 0.02) and dental fluorosis (r = 0.05, P = 0.03). Children who use F tablets regularly and appropriately exhibit mild fluorosis more often than non- or occasional users (odds ratio = 9.58), and have a mean DMFT index 50% lower than other children. We conclude that using F tablets is an effective means of preventing caries. When used appropriately in non fluoridated areas, using F tablets results in minor damage."

        "article_title": "Biochemical properties of recombinant single-chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator mutants with deletion of Asn2 through Phe157 and/or substitution of Cys279 with Ala.",
        "abstract": "The contribution of the NH2-terminal polypeptide chain and of the Cys148-Cys279 interchain disulphide bond to the enzyme activity of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) was studied using site-specific mutagenesis. Recombinant single-chain u-PA (rscu-PA) variants were produced by transfecting Chinese hamster ovary cells with cDNA encoding des(Asn2-Phe157)rscu-PA (rscu-PA with deletion of Asn2-Phe157), [Ala279]rscu-PA (rscu-PA with Cys279----Ala mutation) or des(Asn2-Phe157)[Ala279]rscu-PA [des(Asn2-Phe157)rscu-PA with Cys279----Ala mutation]. Des(Asn2-Phe157)rscu-PA, [Ala279]rscu-PA and des(Asn2-Phe157)[Ala279]rscu-PA, purified from conditioned cell culture medium, were obtained as nearly homogeneous single-chain molecules with Mr approximately 30,000, 54,000 and 30,000, and specific fibrinolytic activities on fibrin plates of (mean +/- SD; n = 3) 860 +/- 150 IU/mg, 43.0 +/- 2.5 IU/micrograms and 240 +/- 20 IU/mg, respectively, compared to 69.0 +/- 4.3 IU/micrograms for wild-type rscu-PA obtained in the same expression system. The plasminogen activating potential in a buffer milieu of [Ala279]rscu-PA was somewhat lower than that of rscu-PA, but that of both deletion mutants was virtually abolished. In a human plasma milieu in vitro, consisting of a radiolabelled human plasma clot submerged in plasma, 50% clot lysis in 2 h required 6.5 micrograms/ml [Ala279]rscu-PA or 3.4 micrograms/ml rscu-PA, whereas with both deletion mutants no significant clot lysis was observed with up to 16 micrograms/ml. Treatment of [Ala279]rscu-PA or rscu-PA with plasmin resulted in quantitative conversion to two-chain molecules and was associated with an increase in specific amidolytic activity from about 600 IU/mg to 62.5 IU/micrograms for [Ala279]rscu-PA as compared to an increase from about 0.3 IU/micrograms to 75.0 IU/micrograms for rscu-PA. In contrast, no significant amidolytic activity could be generated by treatment of des(Asn2-Phe157)rscu-PA or des(Asn2-Phe157)[Ala279]rscu-PA with plasmin. The u-PA B-chain, isolated from plasmin-treated [Ala279]rscu-PA, had enzymic properties which were comparable to those of rtcu-PA, with respect to specific fibrinolytic activity, amidolytic activity, kinetics of plasminogen activation and clot-lysis activity in a human plasma milieu in vitro. Following bolus injection into hamsters, the plasma clearances were comparable (0.7-1.1 ml/min) for wild-type rscu-PA and for the three truncated rscu-PA mutants.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

        "abstract": "The modulation transfer function (MTF) of an idealized imaging system can be determined from the Fourier transform of the system's line-spread function (LSF). Three techniques of experimentally determining the LSF require imaging either a slit, wire, or edge. In this paper, these three techniques are modeled theoretically to determine the noise in the calculated MTFs as a function of spatial frequency resulting from both quantum fluctuations and stochastic detector noise. The techniques are compared using the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the MTF, defined as the ratio of the MTF value to the standard deviation in an ensemble of MTF determinations from independent measurements. It is shown that for a specified photon fluence, the edge method MTF has the highest SNR at low spatial frequencies, while that of the slit method is superior at high frequencies. The wire method SNR is always inferior to that of the slit technique. This suggests that the edge method is preferable for measuring parameters such as the low-frequency drop, and the slit method is preferable for determining high-frequency response. The cross-over frequency at which the slit and edge methods are equal (f(e)) for quantum-noise limited systems is a function of the slit width and the length over which the LSF is measured. For detector-noise limited systems, f(e) is dependent on the slit width only. The SNR in all but the quantum-noise limited slit method can therefore be increased by decreasing the length over which the LSF is measured, smoothing the tails of the LSF, or by fitting the tails to an analytic expression."

While several mutations in imprinted genes have been defined, no variants in the regulatory system that gives rise to imprinting have been described. Here we report our genetic analysis of the behavior of the interstrain, polar, embryonic-lethal phenotype known as the \"DDK syndrome.\" We have mapped the interstrain, polar-lethal region of the genome to the distal portion of mouse chromosome 11, near the Xmv-42 locus. We propose that the lethal phenotype is not caused by a standard mutation, but by aberrant imprinting of a gene within this region."

Isoproterenol (2 x 80 mg/kg in 48 hrs) was injected into the amniotic sac from the 5th embryonic day to the time of hatching. From the 5th to the 7th embryonic day (ed), transposition of great vessels occurs. From the 7th to the 14th ed, blockade of development of coronary vascularization was regularly observed, particularly in the ventral wall of the right ventricle. This effect is always associated with persistence of intertrabecular spaces in the nonvascularized area and with a higher water content in the heart. From the 10th to the 12th ed, degenerative changes of the cardiac musculature can be observed. Lesions were characterized by typical myolysis; capillaries in the affected area were dilated and blocked with packed erythrocytes. Necrotic changes were localized only in those parts of the ventricular walls where the vascular bed and myoarchitecture were normally developed. In comparison with similar changes in adult specimens, inflammatory cellularization is lacking."

        "abstract": "Prospective pathologic staging by pelvic lymphadenectomy in 60 patients with clinically localized carcinoma of the prostate disclosed a high incidence (35 per cent) of clinically silent and unsuspected lymph node metastases. When present, metastatic disease was frequently bilateral (57 per cent) and most commonly involved the obturator-hypogastric lymph nodes (87 per cent). Micrometastases alone were found in 5 patients and the potential significance of this finding on survival is discussed. Although the presence or absence of metastases could not be accurately predicted by histologic analysis of biopsy or prostatectomy specimens, the finding of undifferentiated tumor, marked anaplasia and penetration through the capsule correlated positively with nodal metastases. Pelvic lymphadenectomy is a safe and important diagnostic tool in the accurate staging of these patients. Its widespread use is advocated in patients with clinical stage B1, B2 and C tumors prior to definitive therapy. Based on the prospective data generated in this study lymphatic metastasis appears to be an early event in the spread of prostatic cancer."

For the use of red cells, the equations are developed to include the effect of the variation in apparent nonosmotic water owing to the variation in hemoglobin concentration as the cell swells or shrinks. Two methods of solution of the equations are developed and studied and sample calculations are provided. It is shown that the solutions to the linearized equations commonly found in the literature are insufficiently accurate for some purposes and this inaccuracy is avoided by the methods given here. The importance of retaining the effects of variations in apparent nonosmotic water and in solute volume in the cell is demonstrated."

It is shown that the changes in the sensitivity of both subtypes of platelet adrenoreceptors are closely related to the activation of the stress-realizing systems and may serve as a test for estimating the intensity of neurohumoral imbalance both during pregnancy and surgical intervention.

        "abstract": "The effects of orally administered lead acetate were investigated in 9 adult and 3 kid goats by clinical and necropsy studies. One kid and 6 adults died after having received from 100 to 1392.5 Gm each, given over periods of from 10 to 52 days. Anorexia, diarrhea and body weight loss occurred in all lead treated goats in the study. Basophilic strippling of red blood cells was found in 6 of 8 animals on which weekly hemograms were performed. The pathologic changes were essentially the same as those that have been recorded for other ruminant species with lead poisoning. Intranuclar acid-fast inclusions in the cells of the proximal convulted tubules of the kidney were demonstrated in 9 of 12 lead treated goats and in the liver parenchymal cells of 2 of these animals."

Secondary structure prediction, circular dichroism and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic studies were undertaken to investigate the secondary structure of these peptides. The peptide fragments were found to adopt multiple conformations, depending on their concentration in solution, the presence of the non-ionic detergent octyl-beta-D-glucoside and the polarity of the solvent. The results of biological studies with these peptide fragments are discussed in relation to their conformation, as inferred from the spectroscopic analysis."

        "abstract": "The retrograde intrabiliary injection (RII) technique was used to study the reabsorption of equimolar doses (1,2 mumol) of sulfobromophthalein sodium (BSP) and its analogue phenol 3,6 dibromphthalein disulfonate (DBSP) from the rat biliary tree under the experimental conditions established in this study i.e. variation of retrograde volumes injected and of short time cholestasis. RII was performed with a microliter syringe joined to a cannula positioned in the proximal third of the common bile duct. This technique guaranteed accurate administration of microliter quantities, also free bile flow could be reinitiated 3 - 5 sec after RII. Bile samples were collected in 2, 5 min intervals up to the 5th min, then in 5 min intervals up to the 15th min, and the following 15 min up to the 30th min and analysed for compounds administered by RII. No significant differences in the biliary reabsorption of BSP and DBSP after RII could be detected. Increasing retrograde volumes of 20, 40, 60, 110, and 160 mul lead to decreasing percent recoveries in the bile in the first 2,5 min after RII (88,0 +/- 3,8 - 15,6 +/- 3,1) when bile flow was started at once after RII. An inverse correlation between retrograde volume and percent recoveries was found. Increasing duration of cholestasis (bile flow was started at once, 0,5 min, 3 min, 6 min, and 30 min after RII) results in decreasing percent recoveries of BSP and DBSP in the first 2,5 min after free bile flow was reinitiated (52,7 +/- 3,6 - 20,0 +/- 1,2). A time dependent proportional effect could be detected. Furthermore in the case of BSP concomitant with increasing cholestasis increasing amounts of BSP - conjugates were found in the bile supporting the idea of a continuing ductular - hepatocellular circulation even during complete obstruction of the common bile duct."

        "abstract": "Elevated concentrations of lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]) in plasma are associated with premature coronary heart disease (CHD). Lp(a) levels are largely determined by alleles at the hypervariable apolipoprotein(a) (apo[a]) gene locus, but other genetic and environmental factors as well as diseases also affect plasma Lp(a) concentrations. It is therefore unclear whether Lp(a) is a primary genetic risk factor or whether Lp(a) levels are elevated secondary to disease in CHD patients. We have analyzed apo(a) phenotypes that represent a stable genetic trait in subjects with CHD and control subjects from different populations representing a variety of ethnic groups (Tyrol, Germany, Wales, Israel, Singapore Chinese, and Singapore Indian). Despite differences in sampling design and disease definition in this multipopulation case-control study, those apo(a) isoforms associated with high Lp(a) plasma concentrations (B, S1, and S2) were more frequent in the CHD patients in each ethnic group. These differences were significant in three of the studied populations and highly significant (p < 0.001) in the pooled (total) group. Lp(a) concentrations were also measured in all groups except Germans and were found to be consistently higher in cases than in control subjects in each ethnic group. For all but one population (Israeli) the differences were significant. The effects of the apo(a) size polymorphism on Lp(a) levels were similar in CHD patients and control subjects from different populations. The data demonstrate that alleles at the apo(a) locus determine the risk for CHD through their effects on Lp(a) concentrations across multiple populations with large differences in CHD frequency and risk factor profiles."

This collagen was digested with CNBr, and the resultant nine peptides were isolated and characterized. The chains are cross-linked by cysteinyl residues in the COOH-terminal peptide. Isolation of peptides derived from CNBr digestion of insoluble tissues was used as an assay for the presence of [alpha 1(I)]2alpha 2 and [alpha 1(III)]3 collagens. Both types are present in human skin, intestine, liver, spleen, kidney, lung, aorta, umbilical cord, placental membranes, and myocardium. Bone and tendon contain [alpha 1(I)]2alpha 2 collagen but, unlike the other tissues, lack [alpha 1(III)]3 collagen. Both [alpha 1(I)]2alpha 2 and[alpha 1(III)]3 collagens are present in scars of human skin, myocardium, tendon, and liver and of rabbit skin. The degree of hydroxylation of proline was 4 to 5% lower in the same peptides in skin, bone, and tendon than in the other tissues.

        "abstract": "The best examples of imprinting in humans are provided by the Angelman and Prader-Willi syndromes (AS and PWS) which are associated with maternal and paternal 15q11-13 deletions, respectively, and also with paternal and maternal disomy 15. The region of the deletions has homology with a central part of mouse chromosome 7, incompletely tested for imprinting effects. Here, we report that maternal duplication for this region causes a murine imprinting effect which may correspond to PWS. Paternal duplication was not associated with any detectable effect that might correspond with AS. Gene expression studies established that Snrpn is not expressed in mice with the maternal duplication and suggest that the closely-linked Gabrb-3 locus is not subject to imprinting. Finally, an additional new imprinting effect is described."

Mammary gland DNA and RNA were estimated as a quantitative indication of the extent of mammary gland development. Maternal adrenalectomy or hypophysectomy resulted in a decrease in the mammary gland RNA:DNA ratio. Treatment of adrenalectomized animals with cortisol acetate completely restored the RNA:DNA ratio to the control level. Treatment of hypophysectomized animals with cortisol acetate resulted in an increase in the RNA:DNA ratio but did not restore the ratio to the control level. Removal of the pups had no effect on the RNA:DNA ratio. The findings are discussed in relation to the foetal and maternal contribution to the level of glucocorticoids in the circulation and with respect to changes in mammary gland sensitivity to lactogenic stimulation near term."

        "abstract": "DNA samples from 36 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients from China were screened for a specific mutation affecting codon 249 of the p53 gene, recently identified as a hotspot mutation in some HCCs. We detected the tumor-specific p53 codon 249 mutation in 21 (58%) of 36 HCCs examined. Thirteen patients with the specific codon 249 mutation had lost the remaining allele of p53, whereas the remaining eight patients appeared to have retained both copies of the gene. These results suggest that alterations of p53 may be important events in the genesis of HCCs and that point mutation may precede allele loss."

        "abstract": "We investigated whether the visual evoked potential (VEP) reflects cortical processing associated with preattentive texture segregation. On a visual display unit we presented stimuli with various arrangements of oriented line segments that either led to the appearance of a \"preattentive\" checkerboard or did not. Two presentation modes were used (pattern onset at 1 Hz and rapid pattern change at 4.3 Hz), while luminance (57 cd/m2) and contrast (92%) of the line segments remained constant. VEPs were recorded in 7 human subjects. The VEP was analyzed as a linear combination of putative components, which are evoked by either local pattern, quasi-local orientation contrast or global preattentive structure. In the transient VEP, we found a negativity over the posterior pole at a latency between 161 and 225 msec (FWHM) in the linear combination designed to extract segregation-specific components. Peak amplitude reached 3.1 +/- 0.8 microV (mean +/- SEM) at 199 msec. This negative peak appeared only for textures containing orientation contrast. Steady-state analysis of the rapid presentation also revealed a significant component (P = 0.002) associated with texture segregation. These potentials either represent processing of orientation contrast or global processing of texture segregation. The results suggest that specific surface potentials, differing from cognitive potentials, can be derived which are associated with preattentive processing."

        "abstract": "Effects of human interleukin-6 (hIL-6), the major acute phase inducer, on the expression of transcripts encoding cytochrome P450s were examined in human hepatoma-derived cells. Using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, it was demonstrated that three hepatoma cell lines, HepG2, HepG2f and Hep3B, express P450 mRNAs encoding IA1, IA2 and IIIA3, the major P450 isozymes involved in carcinogen metabolism, and that they also show induction responses to treatment with their specific inducers. When hepatoma cells were treated with hIL-6, the levels of IA1, IA2 and IIIA3 mRNAs were markedly suppressed. These findings suggest that significant down regulation of cytochrome P450s may occur during the acute phase reaction, which may result in alterations in drug biotransformation."

        "abstract": "Myosin I is an actin-based motor responsible for powering a wide variety of motile activities in amebae and slime molds and has been found previously in vertebrates as the lateral bridges within intestinal epithelial cell microvilli. Although neurons exhibit extensive cellular and intracellular motility, including the production of ameboid-like growth cones during development, the proteins responsible for the motor in these processes are unknown. Here, we report the isolation of a partially purified protein fraction from bovine brain that is enriched for a 150-kDa protein; immunochemical and biochemical analyses suggest that this protein possesses a number of functional properties that have been ascribed to myosin I from various sources. These properties include an elevated K(+)-EDTA ATPase, a modest actin-activated Mg(2+)-ATPase, the ability to bind calmodulin, and a ready association with phospholipid vesicles made from phosphatidylserine, but not from phosphatidylcholine. The combination of these properties, together with a molecular mass of 150 kDa (most myosin I molecules found to date have molecular masses in the range 110-130 kDa) yet recognition by an anti-myosin I antibody, suggests the presence of a new member of the myosin I family within mammalian brain."

        "abstract": "A microcolony technique has been demonstrated as being useful for the rapid determination of the viabilities of single cells of Myocbacterium fortuitum. Cultures of M. fortuitum grown to early logarithmic phase in broth were treated with the sputum digestant N-acetyl-L-cysteine-sodium hydroxide (NALC-NaOH) for periods of 10 to 40 s. After growth for three generations (7.5 h) on agar films, viabilities were determined by counting under a phase contrast microscope. The viable mycobacteria grew into microcolonies that exhibited extensive branching, whereas the nonviable mycobacteria remained as single cells. Sputum was mixed with some broth cultures before treatment to stimulate the digestion process in a clinical laboratory. When broth cultures were treated with sputum digestant for 40 s, only 2.8% of the cells remained viable. When the broth cultures were mixed in a ratio of 1:4 with sputum and then treated for 40 s, 16.4% of the cells remained viable. The results also indicate M. fortuitum is very sensitive to the digestant. The results also indicate that a microcolony technique could be used for the assessment of the viability of mycobacteria."

In 116 of these cases a nephrectomy was performed. The average postoperative observation time was 7.8 years. By removal of the hypoplastic kidney the hypertension could be successfully influenced in 72% of the cases and in 16% moderately; in 12% of the patients the high blood pressure remained unchanged also after the intervention. On account of the recognition resulting from the examinations that by the hypoplastic kidney alone no increase of the blood pressure is caused, but the developmental anomaly forms a basis for the development of the hypertension, is emphasized that the early removal of this abnormally developed kidney is by all means indicated."

        "abstract": "The records of 92 patients with flail chest injury treated at a Level I trauma center were analyzed retrospectively. Associated intrathoracic injuries included pulmonary contusion (46 percent) and pneumothorax or hemothorax, or both (70 percent). The incidence of great vessel, tracheobronchial and diaphragmatic injuries was no different from that of a control population with simple rib fractures. Adult respiratory distress syndrome developed in 27 percent of patients with flail chest; 69 percent of all patients required ventilation (mean duration, 22 days). Mean length of hospital stay was 24 days. The mortality rate was 33 percent. We conclude that flail chest serves as a marker of significant intrathoracic injury, highly associated with pulmonary contusion, but even more so with pneumothorax or hemothorax. Flail chest does not seem to be a marker for great vessel, tracheobronchial, or diaphragmatic injuries. The majority of patients (more than two-thirds) will require mechanical ventilation for prolonged periods. Of paramount importance is the recognition of flail chest as a marker of high kinetic energy absorption, resulting in life-threatening thoracic as well as nonthoracic injuries."

Most (60 per cent) of the recurrent episodes occurred within four months of the index episode. Hearing loss persisted beyond two weeks in 8 per cent of testable children. This experience suggests that prophylactic antibiotic use within the first few months after an episode of acute otitis media in young children should be evaluated."

From 1973-1991, 23 patients with Takayasu arteritis have been treated at the University of Southern California. Twelve patients have required 17 arterial reconstructions for symptomatic complications of arterial disease refractory to medical therapy. Indications for operation have included renovascular hypertension (7), extremity ischemia (5), cerebrovascular insufficiency (2), dilated ascended aorta with aortic insufficiency (1), thoracic aortic aneurysm (1), and abdominal aortic aneurysm (1). Long-term clinical follow-up has demonstrated uniform symptomatic improvement. Fifteen of seventeen arterial reconstructions are still patent. Surgical treatment of symptomatic Takayasu arteritis is highly effective. Excellent long-term graft patency can be expected following arterial reconstruction."

        "abstract": "Twenty-six hepatic resections were performed using vascular clamping lasting more than one hour. The average duration of continuous normothermic ischemia was 67.0 +/- 7.5 minutes (plus or minus standard error of the mean) (range of 60 to 85 minutes). Vascular occlusion consisted of simple portal triad clamping in 14 patients and of hepatic vascular exclusion in 12. Extensive hepatectomy was performed upon more than 80 percent of the patients. One postoperative death was recorded. Extensive complications occurred in eight patients, including one case of hepatic failure. Postoperative changes in hepatic function tests were mild and transient. The rate of postoperative complications was higher in the group of patients with chronic hepatic disease (77.8 versus 11.8 percent, p < 0.005). Prolonged hepatic ischemia should not be considered a risk factor in patients with normal livers, whereas morbidity and mortality rates are seriously affected by the presence of chronic hepatic disease."

In the present study, the expression of the major mammalian stress protein, Hsp72, was characterized in the rat peripheral auditory system following varying periods of unilateral cochlear ischemia and reperfusion. Western blot analysis of whole cochlear homogenates revealed Hsp72 expression after as little as 5 minutes of cochlear ischemia. Cochlear Hsp72 immunoreactivity following 10 minutes of ischemia was observed within 2 hours, remained evident through 6 hours, and decreased toward control levels by 12 hours. Preliminary immunocytochemical localization data revealed Hsp72 expression in the outer hair cells. The characterization of Hsp72 expression following transient ischemia represents the first step toward understanding the role that stress proteins have in the protection of the mammalian auditory system."

        "abstract": "Triglyceride utilization is correlated with glycogen resynthesis in developing Ascaris suum larvae. Glycogen content, determined by amyloglucosidase hydrolysis at 2-day intervals, decreases sharply during embryonation from 15% (per mg dry weight) at day 4 to 2% at day 12. Thereafter glycogen increases 3-fold through day 20, marking the resynthesis period. Triglyceride lipid droplets are confirmed primarily to the posterior half of the larvae and mark the site of the interconversion. Although they serve as precursors to glycogen, only a small diminution was observed ultrastructurally. Glycogen accumulation, on the other hand, correlates well with increases determined biochemically. alpha-glycogen builds up among lipid droplets, while beta-glycogen concentrates in the cytoplasm of somatic muscle cells paralleling myofibril development. Dense granules, restricted to the lipid body region, are considered as the possible subcellular site for the enzymatic conversion."

        "abstract": "One to three repeat vaccinations were undertaken in 63 persons (32 males, 31 females; mean age 29 [17-59] years) who had not or inadequately responded to basal immunization with hepatitis B vaccine (47 non- and 16 hyporesponders). After re-vaccination, 12 of the 47 nonresponders and 11 of 16 hyporesponders formed specific antibodies against hepatitis B surface antigen, anti-HBs, at concentrations above 10 IU/l. Six of 14 persons who had not responded to the first repeat vaccination reached anti-HBs concentrations above 10 U/l after a further injection. Vaccination response was age-dependent. The median age of those subjects who responded to the first re-vaccination was 27 (19-45) years, while the non-responders' median age was 34 (22-59) years (P less than 0.05). Re-vaccination also raised initially low anti-HBs values. These results indicate that some of the nonresponders can obtain reliable protection by revaccination(s)."

        "abstract": "Intravaginal torsion of the spermatic cord is seen typically in the peripubertal period. At our hospital 33 patients with intravaginal torsion were seen between 1970 and 1986, and 13 (39%) were more than 20 years old. Because of delay in seeking treatment or error in initial diagnosis proper treatment often was late in these 13 adults. This delay in treatment allowed for a testicular salvage rate of only 38%. Increased awareness by physicians that torsion often occurs in adults plus an accurate history and evaluation may allow for a higher testicular salvage rate in this age group."

        "article_title": "The kinetics of T cell antigen receptor expression by subgroups of CD4+8+ thymocytes: delineation of CD4+8+3(2+) thymocytes as post-selection intermediates leading to mature T cells.",
        "abstract": "Cortical thymocytes from adult mice, separated on the basis of coexpression of CD4 and CD8 or of binding of high levels of peanut agglutinin (PNA), were subdivided according to the level of expression of the T cell receptor (TCR)-CD3 complex. The incidence of dividing cells in the resultant subpopulations was determined by DNA staining. Precursor-product relationships and the timing of TCR-CD3 acquisition were studied using continuous in vivo [3H]TdR labeling and radioautography. The extent of intrathymic selection for TCR specificity in the subpopulations was determined from the incidence of cells bearing V beta 6 or V beta 17a in different mouse strains. The majority of dividing CD4+8+ blast cells expressed extremely low levels of TCR-CD3, indicating that TCR expression and specificity selection generally occurred after division ceased. The [3H]TdR-labeling studies indicated that postdivision TCR expression was rapid, and that those nondividing cortical thymocytes which had not expressed significant levels of TCR by day 1, remained extremely low or negative for their entire 3.6-d lifespan. Small cortical thymocytes which expressed moderate levels of TCR-CD3, were predominantly an unselected population with a lifespan of 3.8 d. A small subgroup of CD4+8+ PNA+ cortical thymocytes expressing high levels of TCR-CD3 was identified as a nondividing intermediate between the small cortical thymocytes expressing moderate levels of TCR and mature medullary thymocytes. These intermediates showed a 1-d lag in [3H]TdR labeling, then a 3.4-d transit time. The cell flux through this intermediate subpopulation was approximately 10(6) cells/d, similar to the rate of turnover of mature thymocytes; thus, although only 3-4% of thymocytes progressed to this intermediate state, once reaching it most then progressed to full maturity. In accordance with this, the incidence of the V beta selection markers within the intermediate subpopulation indicated that both positive and negative selection had already occurred. Selection for TCR specificity in the systems studied appeared to take place among CD4+8+ thymocytes expressing intermediate levels of TCR."

        "article_title": "Re-evaluation of the role of the human endolymphatic sac in Meni\u00e8re's disease.",
        "abstract": "The role of endolymphatic sac (ES) dysfunction in the etiopathogenesis of Meniere's disease has remained controversial since the early 1900s. The first reports of the ultrastructural (transmission electron microscopy, TEM) pathology of the human ES in Meniere's disease have been published only in the last decade. These studies have been based on biopsies of the extraosseous (intradural) ES and in no cases has the TEM appearance of the intraosseous ES been described. Likewise the control material used has been from biopsies of extraosseous ES taken from patients with acoustic schwannomas. To date, no reports have compared the ultrastructure of the intrasosseous ES from normal control patients to patients with Meniere's disease. Since the intraosseous ES is believed to be the most active portion of the entire ES, studies were made of the ultrastructure of ten normal interosseous human ESs fixed immediately after death and obtained at autopsy (control material). Fourteen patients undergoing translabyrinthine (TL) neurotologic procedures (10, TL resection of acoustic schwannoma; 4, TL eighth cranial nerve section for Meniere's disease) had the entire vestibular aqueduct, containing the endolymphatic duct and the intraosseous ES, removed and processed for TEM. The roles of the epithelium, subepithelial space, and vasculature were morphologically studied to evaluate possible ES pathology in Meniere's disease and in patients with acoustic schwannoma. Wide anatomic variation in the distribution and density of the subepithelial connective tissue was observed in all groups. There was no difference in the TEM appearance of the intraosseous ES from normal controls and patients with eighth nerve schwannoma, nor was there any difference in the ES collagen deposition in patients with Meniere's disease. The ESs from two patients with Meniere's disease showed evidence of abnormal glycoprotein metabolism; one with possible hypersecretion and one with possible alteration of degradation of resorbed glycoprotein. The results of this preliminary study suggest that \"perisaccular fibrosis\" of the intraosseous ES was not a pathologic feature in these four cases of Meniere's disease and that alteration of ES glycoprotein secretion/resorption may be of etiopathologic significance."

        "abstract": "Hair samples from 20 documented heroin users contained 6-acetylmorphine, a unique metabolite of heroin, in all samples. Heroin was identified in smaller amounts in seven of these samples. The identity of 6-acetylmorphine and heroin was established by comparison of full scan spectra of extracts to standard reference materials. The presence of 6-acetylmorphine generally predominated over heroin, morphine, and codeine. The mean concentrations of analytes were as follows: 6-acetylmorphine, 0.90 ng/mg, N = 20; heroin, 0.17 ng/mg, N = 7; morphine, 0.26 ng/mg, N = 20; codeine, 0.18 ng/mg, N = 15. Analysis of hair samples obtained from 10 drug-free control subjects were negative for 6-acetylmorphine, morphine, and codeine. However, a small interfering peak was observed at the retention time for heroin. Control samples soaked in aqueous solutions of heroin and 6-acetylmorphine were found to be contaminated, even though an initial wash step was included in the analysis. These data suggest that hair analysis for 6-acetylmorphine can be used to differentiate heroin users from other types of opiate exposure (e.g., poppy seed, licit morphine, and codeine); however, environmental contamination can potentially produce false positives during opiate testing."

Transcription factor IIIA, the internal control region of the 5 S RNA gene and specific DNA sequences 5' and 3' of the internal control region are all involved in the formation of a multiprotein complex. Specific protein-DNA interactions outside of the 5 S RNA gene itself, revealed by DNase I footprinting, have no apparent role in the transcription process. Sequences within the 5 S RNA gene, 5' of the internal control region, are not essential for transcription by RNA polymerase III in vitro, but do contribute to its efficiency."

        "abstract": "The effector binding site of Escherichia coli aspartate transcarbamoylase, composed of the triphosphate and ribose-base subsites, is located on the regulatory (r) chains of the enzyme. In order to probe the function of amino acid side chains at this nucleotide triphosphate site, site-specific mutagenesis was used to create three mutant versions of the enzyme. On the basis of the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme with CTP bound, three residues were selected. Specifically, Arg-96r was replaced with Gln, and His-20r and Tyr-89r were both replaced with Ala. Analyses of these mutant enzymes indicate that none of these substitutions significantly alter the catalytic properties of the enzyme. However, the mutations at His-20r and Tyr-89r produced altered response to the regulatory nucleotides. For the His-20r----Ala enzyme, the affinities of the enzyme for ATP and CTP are reduced 40-fold and 10-fold, respectively, when compared with the wild-type enzyme. Furthermore, CTP is able to inhibit the His-20r----Ala enzyme 40% more than the wild-type enzyme. In the case of the Tyr-89r----Ala enzyme. ATP can increase the mutant enzyme's activity 181% compared to 157% for the wild-type enzyme, while simultaneously the affinity of this enzyme for ATP decreases about 70%. These results suggest that Tyr-89r does have an indirect role in the discrimination between ATP and CTP. The His-20r----Ala enzyme shows no UTP synergistic inhibition in the presence of CTP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

In the present study we evaluated the predictive value of a number of hemodynamic and endocrine parameters. In addition we included information on cognitive factors such as stress and the belief in the structured training and motivation to participate. Twenty-five elderly subjects were studied. Significant improvement in overall walking distance was achieved. The most important explanatory variables of relative improvement in walking distance were belief in training, initial walking distance and number of smoke years. The results support the belief that cognitive factors are of major importance in predicting functional effects of structured training programs for patients with intermittent claudication."

This overview is currently being organized. Care is taken on identifying all randomized studies, published or unpublished, to avoid publication bias. Already 15 studies possibly related to the question are under investigation. Principal investigators of each relevant study are invited to participate in the overview. The principal end points of the study are overall and cause-specific mortality. The first report of results is planned for the end of 1991."

Left anterior descending coronary artery was the most frequently involved vessel in both the groups, 102/125 (81.6%) in Group I and 120/125 (96%) in Group II (P less than 0.001). The incidence of left main coronary artery involvement was 5/125 (4%) in Group I and 15/125 (12%) in Group II (P less than 0.05) and coronary artery calcification was 17/125 (13.7%) in Group I and 72/125 (57.6%) in Group II (P less than 0.001). Triple vessel disease was the most common form of involvement, 56/125 (44.8%) in Group I and 65/125 (52.8%) in Group II (P = NS). The incidence of diffuse disease was 35/125 (28%) in Group I vs 39/125 (31.2%) in Group II (P = NS), ectasia was observed in 13/125 (10.1%) in Group I vs 15/125 (12%) in Group II (P = NS) and coronary collaterals were found in 42/125 (33.6%) in Group I and 56/125 (44.8%) in Group II (P = NS). Thus left main and left anterior descending coronary artery disease and coronary calcification were more common in the older age group. Our findings suggest that in young Indian patients with IHD, multivessel and extensive coronary artery involvement in frequently seen. This pattern of involvement has many features resembling the disease pattern in their older counterparts."

Calves fed colostrum within the first 24 h after birth had significantly higher rectal temperatures, heart rates and respiratory frequencies than calves provided only water or glucose. Significantly elevated plasma nonesterified fatty acid and bilirubin concentrations on d 1 and 2 of life in calves fed only water on d 1 compared with calves of the other groups mirrored reduced energy intake. Fecal consistency was significantly higher during wk 1 of life, and gastrin and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide increased only on d 1 and/or 2 of life in calves already fed colostrum on d 1, expressing improved functioning of the gastrointestinal tract. Significantly higher plasma globulin levels up to d 7 in calves fed colostrum on d 1 than in those starting colostrum intake only on d 2 demonstrated significantly enhanced efficiency of gamma-globulin absorption. Furthermore, significantly higher circulating glucose, albumin, insulin, insulin-like growth factor-I concentrations and significantly lower urea levels in calves fed colostrum on d 1 compared with those fed colostrum starting on d 2 of life indicated stimulation of anabolic processes. In conclusion, colostrum intake by calves within the first 24 h of life is needed not only for an adequate immune status, but also to produce the additional important and favorable effects on metabolic and endocrine traits and on vitality."

We found that opaque plastic gates were well recognized by the paradise fish (Macropodus opercularis) even if the strips were very thin, but that they only changed their pattern of movement when the strips exceeded a certain width. Thus, paradise fish appear to be able to distinguish a physical space of the same size as consisting of either one or two compartments, depending on the material (transparency) and width of the dividing strips."

Among mice receiving paired delivery of cues and IL-1, subsequent re-exposure to cues elicited corticosterone production. This response was significantly greater than in animals that were conditioned but not re-exposed to the cues or were exposed to the cues alone. These results indicate that the IL-1 activation of adrenal cortical secretion can be conditioned to environmental stimuli."

        "abstract": "Albumin-free testis mitochondrial ATPase activity failed to be stimulated by either 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) or carbonyl cyanide rho-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP). DNP scarcely enhanced the state 4 respiration and mitochondria proved to be poorly coupled. When 1% bovine serum albumin was added to the isolation medium, DNP or FCCP stimulated ATPase nearly twofold and the dose-response curves for the uncouplers on the QO2 reached a plateau at five- to sixfold. The DNP coupling index (q) also showed a 30-40% improvement. A dose-response curve for oligomycin on the rate of [gamma-32P]ATP synthesis showed a stimulation of ATP synthase activity by 10-100 ng inhibitor/mg protein, suggesting a possible blockade of \"open\" F0 channels. In the albumin preparation oligomycin inhibited ATP synthesis in the range 10-100 ng/mg protein. Since testis ATPase is known to be loosely bound to the membrane, an effect of albumin, improving tightness in the interaction of the F1 and the F0 sectors of the ATPase, is suggested."

        "abstract": "The incidence of mechanical complications associated with the Nissen fundoplication has prompted evaluation of an anti-reflux procedure designed to be simpler and more physiological, and encompassing a broader view of the many factors involved in the anti-reflux mechanism. Preliminary assessment of the first 100 patients with a mean follow-up of 3.5 years showed symptomatic improvement in 96 per cent and complete relief in 85 per cent. A further 100 patients were studied using formal symptom scoring, endoscopy, manometry and pH monitoring performed before operation and 3 months after operation. Similar clinical results were accompanied by improvement in endoscopic oesophagitis in 95 per cent, complete healing in 74 per cent and restoration of the pH profile to physiological levels in 84 per cent. Troublesome mechanical complications comprised a 2 per cent incidence of dysphagia, but there was no gas bloat or inability to belch or vomit, which may relate to the restoration of lower oesophageal sphincter characteristics close to those of 30 asymptomatic controls. The procedure is simpler to perform than total fundoplication, is well tolerated and is applicable to patients with reflux stricture and impaired oesophageal body motility. The results of this study support the hypotheses that effective reflux control can be achieved without total fundoplication by attention to several factors of known relevance to the anti-reflux mechanism, and that restoration of characteristics of the lower oesophageal sphincter close to physiological levels results in a lower incidence of mechanical complications."

        "abstract": "The modified Airlie House classification of diabetic retinopathy has been extended for use in the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS). The revised classification provides additional steps in the grading scale for some characteristics, separates other characteristics previously combined, expands the section on macular edema, and adds several characteristics not previously graded. The classification is described and illustrated and its reproducibility between graders is assessed by calculating percentages of agreement and kappa statistics for duplicate gradings of baseline color nonsimultaneous stereoscopic fundus photographs. For retinal hemorrhages and/or microaneurysms, hard exudates, new vessels, fibrous proliferations, and macular edema, agreement was substantial (weighted kappa, 0.61 to 0.80). For soft exudates, intraretinal microvascular abnormalities, and venous beading, agreement was moderate (weighted kappa, 0.41 to 0.60). A double grading system, with adjudication of disagreements of two or more steps between duplicate gradings, led to some improvement in reproducibility for most characteristics."

The major purpose of this study was to determine the use of APACHE II as a means of predicting outcome of ICU oncology patients. Data were retrospectively collected for 451 ICU oncology admissions. A direct relationship between severity of physiologic derangement and patient risk of death was demonstrated. Patients with scores of 30 or greater had hospital mortality rates of 100% for postoperative and 92.6% for nonoperative patients. The APACHE II was a useful means of predicting the outcome of ICU oncology patients. This potentially provides the patient, family, and physician an objective dimension in making decisions whether to transfer the oncology patient."

        "abstract": "Antineoplastic drugs are known to affect the intestinal wall and suppress the absorption of phenytoin (PHT), resulting in a decrease in the serum PHT level. UFT (not an abbreviation) is a mixture of uracil, which enhances the activity of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and tegafur, a masked compound of 5-FU. The authors report three cases in which treatment of malignant brain tumors with UFT caused acute PHT intoxication. Two patients received PHT preoperatively at 150-200 and 270 mg/day, and showed serum PHT levels of less than 5 micrograms/ml. The third patient was started on 150 mg/day of PHT after surgery. Postoperatively, in addition to radiation therapy, each patient received 4 capsules of UFT (each containing 100 mg of tegafur) per day. Their serum PHT levels peaked at 48.2, 30.9, and 24.2 micrograms/ml, and all three exhibited clinical symptoms of acute PHT intoxication. The mechanism of interaction of these two drugs is obscure. Tegafur may compete with PHT in binding to metabolic enzymes in the liver and/or directly suppress PHT metabolism, leading to an increase in the serum PHT concentration. Therefore, when PHT is given in combination with a masked compound of 5-FU, the serum PHT level should be closely monitored."

Records of all patients seen in the ED between February 1985 and December 1986 with WBC counts greater than or equal to 25,000/microliters were identified. Each patient was paired with the chronologically nearest patient with a WBC count between 15,000 and 25,000/microliters. Of the total WBCs obtained, 5.8% were greater than or equal to 25,000/microliters; only 1% were greater than or equal to 35,000/microliters. Eighteen percent of patients with counts greater than or equal to 25,000/microliters had a serious disease, and 6% had bacteremia. Twenty-six percent of patients with counts greater than or equal to 35,000/microliters had a serious disease, and 10% had bacteremia. On the basis of infrequency and severity of illness, we suggest that, in children presenting to a pediatric emergency department, WBC counts greater than or equal to 35,000/microliters be considered extreme leukocytosis."

Deteriorations in AMLR have been reported in many autoimmune diseases and in diseases with a derangement in T cell regulatory function. We have studied AMLR in 23 newly diagnosed Type-1 diabetic patients and 32 healthy subjects. T and non-T cells were purified by rosetting mononuclear cells with sheep erythrocytes and separating the rosetted T cells from the nonrosetted non-T cells by density gradient centrifugation. Purity of T-lymphocytes isolated was 90% as determined by indirect immunofluorescent analysis with monoclonal antibodies. Proliferation of lymphocytes was measured in response to phytohaemagglutinin and of concanavalin A in a lymphocyte transformation test. In the present study, a deficient AMLR is demonstrated in patients with newly diagnosed Type-1 diabetes. Our data provide evidence for an aberrant immune regulation at the time of diabetes manifestation. The deficient AMLR may represent the in-vitro expression of an in-vivo process against pancreatic cells."

Blocking ID in HA rats before injury suppressed autotomy. Correspondingly, artificial prolongation of ID in LA rats just prior to neurectomy, increased autotomy. The autotomy in these HA and LA rats was like that of their Sabra ancestors. This suggests that the underlying basis for selection of these lines was differential sensitivity of the CNS to the effects of ID."

        "abstract": "We have developed a rapid filtration technique for the measurement of Ca2+ release from isolated sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles. Using this technique, we have studied the Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release of sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles from rabbit skeletal muscle passively loaded with 5 mM Ca2+. The effect of known effectors (adenine nucleotides and caffeine) and inhibitors (Mg2+ and ruthenium red) of this release were investigated. In a medium composed of 100 mM KCl buffered at pH 6.8 with 20 mM K/3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid the Ca2+ release rate was maximal (500 nmol of Ca2+ released.(mg of protein)-1.s-1) at 1 micron external Ca2+ and 5 mM ATP. We also observed a rapid Ca2+ release induced by micromolar Ag+ in the presence of ATP (at 1 nM Ca2+). The Ag+-induced Ca2+ release was totally inhibited by 5 micron ruthenium red. We have also investigated the effect of monovalent ions on the Ca2+ release elicited by Ca2+ or Ag+. We show that the Ca2+ release rate: 1) was dependent upon the presence of K+ or Na+ in the release medium and 2) was influenced by a K+ gradient created across the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane. These results directly support the idea of the involvement of an influx of K+ (through K+ channels) during the Ca2+ release and allow to reconsider a possible influence of the membrane potential of the sarcoplasmic reticulum on the Ca2+ release."

        "abstract": "The clinical aspects and anatomopathological patterns of 150 postmenopausal women were studied using the progestogen challenge test. An endometrial biopsy was obtained and submitted to the progestogen test. A histopathological analysis of the uterine mucosa from women with a positive progestogen test revealed that the endometrium was active in 44 percent of cases and atrophic or inactive in 56 percent. In contrast, among women with a negative response, the endometrium was atrophic in 94 percent of cases and active in 6 percent. Analysis of clinical aspects did not show significant differences between groups in terms of age; age at menarche and at menopause; fasting blood glucose levels; or body mass. However, postmenopausal time was significantly shorter for women with a positive test, with a correlation between postmenopausal time of one to two years and test positivity. The progestogen challenge test for the detection of atrophic endometrium presented 78.57 percent sensitivity, 77.05 percent specificity, 44 percent positive predictive value, and 94 percent negative predictive value. Thus, when negative, the test is highly valuable, indicating the presence of atrophic endometrium in 94 percent of cases. False-negative results occurred in only 6 percent of the subjects, with no case of hyperplasia detected. However, when the response to the test was positive, the endometrium was atrophic in 56 percent of the cases. We suggest that, in order to avoid invasive procedures, the progestogen challenge test be combined with other methods such as transvaginal ultrasonography."

        "abstract": "Over the last decade, it has become evident that homologous transfusions carry immunologic consequences beyond the well-understood ones of alloimmunization to blood cell antigens. Transfusions constitute temporary transplants of large amounts of allogeneic antigen given intravenously and cause down-regulation of many cellular immune functions. These changes may explain in part the association of transfusion with such clinically important events as (1) improved survival of renal allografts, (2) decreased recurrence rates for autoimmune disease, (3) increased frequency and earlier recurrences of solid tumors, (4) increased frequency of post-operative bacterial infection, and (5) increased severity of viral infection. Preliminary data suggest that, in animal models and clinical settings, syngeneic or autologous transfusions are not associated with such events. This finding supports the hypothesis that these associations are cause and effect and involve immunologic mechanisms."

        "abstract": "Erythrocyte choline concentrations were measured in hospitalized patients with bipolar disorder, manic phase, and control subjects. There was a significant elevation in mean erythrocyte choline in the patients with mania. This elevation in erythrocyte choline was due to a subgroup of patients with especially high values. Significant clinical differences were apparent between the patients with \"high\" and those with \"low\" erythrocyte choline concentrations. The subgroup of manic patients with elevated erythrocyte choline had a more severe illness at admission, a worse outcome at discharge, and required significantly more neuroleptic during hospitalization than their low choline counterparts; that is, they were less likely to respond well to lithium alone. Furthermore, the bipolar patients with low erythrocyte choline concentrations, as a whole, had more than four times as many previous manic episodes than depressive episodes, while the patients with high choline values had approximately the same number of past manias and depressions. These results are discussed in light of the evidence implicating cholinergic neurotransmission in the pathophysiology of affective disorders. In addition, the design of future clinical studies of erythrocyte choline and its possible clinical utility are discussed."

        "abstract": "A new method is described for three-dimensional reconstruction from serial ultrathin sections, using \"meta-balls\" as a primitive of object modeling in computer graphics (CG). We take advantage of the meta-ball's blobbiness characteristic and its rendering system for reconstructing images. The two-dimensional outline data from serial sections are converted into three-dimensional meta-ball data with a graphic editor, \"Metack,\" by which we can check the correctness of the data conversion. Then the converted data are visualized on a color display with a CG rendering software, \"Tracy\". This reconstruction method is applied in studying the spatial distribution of Ito cells (fat storing cells) in the cod liver in relation to the blood capillary. By observing the reconstructed images, we can easily understand the three-dimensional relationship between the Ito cells and the blood capillary. The Ito cells surround the blood capillary and extend their cytoplasmic processes into the inter-parenchymal space to make a well-developed network system. These findings would support a concept of \"hepatoskeletal system\" formed by Ito cells in the cod liver. Therefore, we think that the meta-ball reconstruction method is useful in morphological study."

        "abstract": "A synthetic 22-mer peptide that mimics the sequence of a putative pore segment of the voltage-dependent sodium channel forms transmembrane ionic channels in lipid bilayers. Several features of the authentic sodium channel are exhibited by the synthetic peptide: (i) The single channel conductance of the most frequent event is 20 pS in 0.5 M NaCl. (ii) The single channel open and closed lifetimes are in the ms time range. (iii) The synthetic channel discriminates cations over anions but is nonselective between Na+ and K+. However, the synthetic channel displays no significant voltage dependence. Energetic considerations suggest a bundle of four parallel amphipathic alpha-helices as the most plausible channel structure. The synthetic 22-mer channel-forming peptide allows study of the mechanisms of ion permeation through sodium channels by protein engineering techniques."

        "article_title": "Electrostatic radius of the gramicidin channel determined from voltage dependence of H+ ion conductance.",
        "abstract": "The results of Decker and Levitt (1987) suggest that the conductance of H+ ion through the gramicidin channel is limited primarily by diffusion in the bulk solution at the channel mouth. It is assumed in this paper that the H+ conductance is 100% diffusion limited. This means that all the factors that influence the H+ flux are external to the channel and are presumed to be known. In particular, the diffusion coefficient of H+ in this region is assumed to be equal to the bulk solution value and the only force acting on the ion is that due to the applied voltage. A model of the H+ flux is derived, based on the Nernst-Planck equation. It has three adjustable parameters: the electrostatic radius, the capture distance, and the radius of the H+ ion. The acceptable range of the parameters was determined by comparing the predictions of the model with the experimental measurements of the H+ conductance at pH 3.75. The best fit was obtained for an electrostatic radius in the range 2.3-2.7 A. This is in good agreement with earlier predictions (2.5 A) based on the assumption that the dielectric constant of the channel water is equal to that of bulk water. The addition of 1 M choline Cl- (an impermeant) increases the H+ current at low voltage and decreases it at high voltage. The increase can be explained by the small surface charge that results from the separation of charge produced by exclusion of the large choline cation (relative to Cl-) from the membrane surface. The decrease at high voltages can be accounted for by the change in the profile of the applied potential produced by the increase in ionic strength."

        "abstract": "To map the protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions involved in lambda site-specific recombination, Int cleavage assays with suicide substrates, nuclease protection patterns, gel retardation experiments, and quantitative Western blotting were applied to wild-type attL and attL mutants. The results lead to a model in which one IHF molecule bends the attL DNA and forms a higher order complex with the three bivalent Int molecules required for excisive recombination. It is proposed that each of the Int molecules binds in a unique manner: one bridges two DNA binding sites in cis, one is held via its high affinity amino-terminal DNA binding domain, and the third depends upon protein-protein interactions in addition to its low affinity carboxy-terminal DNA binding domain. This protein-DNA complex contains two unsatisfied DNA binding domains, each with a different sequence specificity, and is well suited to specific interactions with an appropriate recombination partner."

        "abstract": "Two peptides with vasodilatory properties consisting of amino acids 1-30 and 31-67 of the 98 a.a. N-terminal end of the prohormone of atrial natriuretic factor (proANF) which circulates in man were investigated to determine if they have specific binding sites on membranes isolated from DDT1 MF-2 smooth muscle cells. Smooth muscle is a known biologic target of these peptides. Competitive binding experiments revealed that proANFs (1-30), (31-67), and (99-126) (i.e., C-terminus; ANF) each had specific and separate binding sites. The dissociation constants for proANFs (1-30), (31-67), and (99-126) binding were 0.11 nM, 4 nM, and 7.3 nM, respectively. The binding site concentrations for proANFs (1-30), (31-67), and ANF were 2.57, 59.91 and 40 fmols/10(6) cells, respectively. The number of binding sites per cell were 1548, 36,087, and 24,090, respectively, for proANFs (1-30), (31-67), and (99-126) (ANF). Each peptide bound to DDT1 MF-2 membranes between 10(-8) to 10(-11) M but could only bind to the other peptides' receptors at concentrations of 10(-6) and 10(-7)M. These results suggest that proANF(1-30) and proANF(31-67) do not work through the ANF receptor but rather have their own separate and distinct receptors that mediate their biologic effects."

        "abstract": "Direct positive correlation has been shown between the level of stimulation of peripheral blood lymphocytes and of the inhibition degree of PHA stimulation by dexamethasone. On the basis of this correlation we subdivided all the examined individuals into three groups of susceptibility: resistant, sensitive, and intermediate. The studies carried out in these groups showed that the reception effectiveness of glucocorticoids (GC) was much higher in the sensitive group than in the group of resistant individuals. In this group interleukin 2 (IL-2) production was relatively high; in the intermediate group this parameter was lower, and in the group of sensitive individuals the mean indices of IL-2 production were the lowest. However, this latter group unlike the two others was heterogeneous and may be divided into two subgroups: high and low IL-2 producers. HLA antigens B7 and DR2 were also shown to be associated with a decrease in sensitivity to GC inhibition of PHA-induced lymphocyte proliferation. Our results indicate that the method we used is adequate enough for dividing individuals into sensitivity groups."

        "abstract": "Of 41 wild-derived mouse strains analyzed, 14 contained T cells bearing V beta 17 receptors in spite of the concomitant expression of I-E antigens. Reciprocal F1 and F2 hybrids of one of these strains, PWK, with laboratory strains revealed different patterns of V beta 17 T cell deletions from those observed with V beta 17 T cells from SJL, implying that the two V beta 17 regions are associated with recognition of distinct superantigens. The structures of the V beta 17 alleles differ by two amino acid substitutions, which lie together in an area distant from the predicted site of T cell receptor interaction with peptide-MHC complexes but overlapping with that implicated in V beta 8.2 recognition of Mls-1 superantigen. This demonstrates that the self-superantigen leading to V beta 17 T cell deletion varies with the allele of the receptor gene and confirms that T cell deletions by such ligands involve interactions with a region of the V beta domain that is distinct from the conventional combining site."

        "abstract": "Sarcolemmal vesicles of white and red skeletal muscles of the rabbit were prepared by consecutive density gradient centrifugations in sucrose and dextran according to Seiler and Fleischer (1982, J. Biol. Chem. 257, 13,862-13,871). White and red muscle membrane fractions enriched in sarcolemma were characterized by high ouabain-sensitive Na+, K(+)-ATPase, by high Mg2(+)-ATPase activity, and by a high cholesterol content. Ca2(+)-ATPase activity, a marker enzyme for sarcoplasmic reticulum, was not detectable in the highly purified white and red muscle sarcolemmal fractions. White and red muscle sarcolemmal fractions exhibited no significant differences with regard to Na+, K(+)-ATPase, Mg2(+)-ATPase, and cholesterol. Specific activity of carbonic anhydrase in white muscle sarcolemmal fractions was 38 U.ml/mg and was 17.6 U.ml/mg in red muscle sarcolemma. Inhibition properties of sarcolemmal carbonic anhydrase were analyzed for acetazolamide, chlorzolamide, and cyanate. White muscle sarcolemmal carbonic anhydrase is characterized by inhibition constants, KI, toward acetazolamide of 4.6 X 10(-8) M, toward chlorzolamide of 0.75 X 10(-8) M, and toward cyanate of 1.3 X 10(-4) M. Red muscle sarcolemmal carbonic anhydrase is characterized by KI values toward acetazolamide of 8.1 X 10(-8) M, toward chlorzolamide of 6.3 X 10(-8) M, and toward cyanate of 0.81 X 10(-4) M. In contrast to the high specific carbonic anhydrase activities in sarcolemma, carbonic anhydrase activity in sarcoplasmic reticulum from white muscle varied between values of only 0.7 and 3.3 U.ml/mg. Carbonic anhydrase of red muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum ranged from 2.4 to 3.7 U.ml/mg."

An infantile case involving a lesion in the left parietal bone is described. The patient was a 6-month-old girl admitted with a mass measuring 2 x 2 cm in the left parietal region. Skull x-rays showed an osteolytic lesion with a sclerotic margin in the parietal bone. Computed tomographic (CT) scans revealed a low-density mass with homogeneous enhancement. The tumor adhered to the dura and had destroyed the left parietal bone. Histological examination disclosed spindle-shaped cells arranged in short bundles and abundant vasculature. Phosphotungstic acid hematoxylin staining revealed longitudinal fibrils resembling myofibroblasts. This is the first report in which CT findings are described in a case of infantile myofibromatosis with a solitary lesion occurring in the skull."

        "abstract": "Radionuclide venography (RNV) is an accepted, reliable, and simple method for detecting thrombi of the deep venous system of the lower extremity. No universal agreement, however, has been established regarding specific techniques for tourniquet applications. In fact, present data reflect a general consensus that tourniquet use and location other than above the ankles has no appreciable or recognizable effect on study outcome. A prospective study was performed on 20 consecutive patients referred for RNV with the clinical impression of deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Each patient was studied initially with tourniquets above the knee and ankle, then with tourniquets above the ankle only, and finally without tourniquets. On the basis of standard criteria for DVT, 8 out of 20 patients were positive for DVT when the study was performed with tourniquets only above the ankle. Four of the eight positive studies became negative, however, when additional tourniquets were placed above the knees (20% false-positive rate). It is concluded that the routine application of additional tourniquets above the knees would eliminate a significant number of false-positive studies and should be part of an established routine protocol."

        "abstract": "The internalization of 45Ca by the calcium-transporting ATPase into sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles from rabbit muscle was measured during a single turnover of the enzyme by using a quench of 7 mM ADP and EGTA (25 degrees C, 5 mM MgCl2, 100 mM KCl, 40 mM MOPS.Tris, pH 7.0). Intact vesicles containing either 10-20 microM or 20 mM Ca2+ were preincubated with 45Ca for approximately 20 s and then mixed with 0.20-0.25 mM ATP and excess EGTA to give 70% phosphorylation of Etot with the rate constant k = 300 s-1. The two 45Ca ions bound to the phosphoenzyme (EP) become insensitive to the quench with ADP as they are internalized in a first-order reaction with a rate constant of k = approximately 30 s-1. The first and second Ca2+ ions that bind to the free enzyme were selectively labeled by mixing the enzyme and 45Ca with excess 40Ca, or by mixing the enzyme and 40Ca with 45Ca, for 50 ms prior to the addition of ATP and EGTA. The internalization of each ion into loaded or empty vesicles follows first-order kinetics with k = approximately 30 s-1; there is no indication of biphasic kinetics or an induction period for the internalization of either Ca2+ ion. The presence of 20 mM Ca2+ inside the vesicles has no effect on the kinetics or the extent of internalization of either or both of the individual ions. The Ca2+ ions bound to the phosphoenzyme are kinetically equivalent. A first-order reaction for the internalization of the individual Ca2+ ions is consistent with a rate-limiting conformational change of the phosphoenzyme with kc = 30 s-1, followed by rapid dissociation of the Ca2+ ions from separate independent binding sites on E approximately P.Ca2; lumenal calcium does not inhibit the dissociation of calcium from these sites. Alternatively, the Ca2+ ions may dissociate sequentially from E approximately P.Ca2 following a rate-limiting conformational change. However, the order of dissociation of the individual ions can not be distinguished. An ordered-sequential mechanism for dissociation requires that the ions dissociate much faster (k greater than or equal to 10(5) s-1) than the forward and reverse reactions for the conformational change (k-c = approximately 3000 s-1). Finally, the Ca2+ ions may exchange their positions rapidly on the phosphoenzyme (kmix greater than or equal to 10(5) s-1) before dissociating. A Hill slope of nH = 1.0-1.2, with K0.5 = 0.8-0.9 mM, for the inhibition of turnover by binding of Ca2+ to the low-affinity transport sites of the phosphoenzyme was obtained from rate measurements at six different concentrations of Mg2+."

        "abstract": "We found that antitumor effect of OK-432, a lyophylized preparation of an attenuated strain of streptococcus pyogenes, on colorectal carcinoma was greatly augmented when it was injected intratumorally in conjunction with fibrinogen. Twenty cases of colorectal cancer received intratumoral injection of 5 KE of OK-432 mixed with 80mg of fibrinogen including factor-XIII and 1ml of aprotinin at the time of endoscopic examination. Changes in the shape of the tumors were observed endoscopically within a few days after injection, and in most cases, decrease in the height of tumor margin was noted. Histopathological findings on surgically resected specimens revealed that the fine meshwork of fibrin was formed at the injected site soon after the injection, and a marked infiltration of inflammatory cells including neutrophils, plasma cells, macrophages, eosinophils and lymphocytes. Such granulomatous changes developed over 7 days after injection, and the degradation of tumors were observed. By 14 days after the injection, tumor tissues were largely replaced with granulomas, and shrinkage of tissues were observed. These findings indicated that fibrinogen including factor-XIII and aprotinin has a potential ability to augment the immunoreaction induced by biological response modifiers, and intratumoral injection of OK-432 in conjunction with fibrinogen solution was superior to intratumoral injection of OK-432 alone as the local immunotherapy of colorectal cancer."

        "abstract": "Cathepsin D is an acidic lysosomal protease present in all cells. In estrogen receptor positive and negative breast cancer cell lines, the mRNA coding for pro-cathepsin D is overexpressed and sorting and maturation of the pro-enzyme are altered, leading to accumulation of the active proteinase in large endosomes and to secretion of the precursor (52K protein). In MCF7 cells, the cathepsin D mRNA is induced directly and transcriptionally by estrogens and indirectly by growth factors. In vitro, pro-cathepsin D is an autocrine mitogen on breast cancer cells and can be auto-activated to degrade extracellular matrix and proteoglycans and to activate other proteinases in acidic microenvironments. In patients, there is a significant correlation between high cathepsin D concentrations in the cytosol of primary breast cancer and development of metastasis. This marker is independent of other prognostic factors and appears to be particularly useful in lymph node-negative tumors. These results suggest that overexpression and possible derouting of cathepsin D plays an important role in invasion and metastasis of breast cancer."

The cell consists of three electrodes: a gold working electrode, a stainless steel counter electrode, and a palladium reference electrode. Other fluid-path cell components are fabricated of PEEK, Kel-F, and Teflon. The solid state palladium reference electrode requires no filling solutions and hence has no additional junction potentials. This versatile, pH-sensitive reference electrode allows the cell to compensate for pH shifts in the gold working electrode, resulting in better reproducibility. The cell functioned well for more than 2700 injections of a glucose standard over 6 weeks without maintenance of any kind. The control module uses a three pulse waveform that allows for selectable potentials and pulse durations as well as an adjustable delay period prior to the acquisition of the analytical signal."

        "abstract": "The present study attempted to get insight into the etiology of bladder cancer by investigating the relation of this neoplasia to other 4 cancers as regards their risk variations in time and space. The results obtained are as follows: 1) Caucasians in Western countries were more inclined to develop bladder cancer than other ethnic groups, as compared among 43 population units of the world in terms of the age-adjusted incidence rate (AAIR). 2) In the same 43 comparison sets, male populations were always higher than female populations in their bladder cancer risks. The male to female ratio for the majority of the populations ranged from 3 to 4. In some population units, the ratios were much higher. In both male and female populations, the cancer risk increased with age. 3) Bladder cancer incidence in the world has been rising during the past 20 years, as detected in the follow-up study of 16 population units. 4) A negative linear relationship was detected for both sexes between bladder cancer and stomach cancer (non-Western type) regarding their log-transformed AAIRs, as calculated with data of the same 16 population units from 1960 through 1980. The same calculation with the esophagus cancer-bladder cancer pair gave marginally negative and no correlations respectively in the male and female populations. A positive linear relationship was detected in the comparison of bladder cancer with 2 Western type cancers (cancers of the colon and lung). 5) Japanese immigrants to the US were just in between Whites in the US (high-risk populations) and native Japanese (low-risk populations) in their bladder cancer risks. The same Japanese immigrants were again just in between Whites in the US (low-risk populations) and native Japanese (high-risk populations) in their stomach cancer risks. In conclusion, bladder cancer is a Western type cancer with sex and age discriminations in its occurrence. The cancer risk also varies depending on the life style of a population (environment dependent). The results obtained are discussed from the point of view of endocrinological oncology."

        "article_title": "On the structure of the epidemic spread of AIDS: the influence of an infectious coagent.",
        "abstract": "The reported AIDS cases in the USA and the Federal Republic of Germany are growing almost exponentially. Considering the epidemiological curves for different risk groups (homosexual men, i.v. drug abusers, heterosexual partners etc.) it is extremely surprising, that nearly exactly the same development occurs in all risk groups. One only has to consider a certain time shift for each group. The conformity of the development for all groups is evident by the fact, that the curves representing the reported AIDS cases for different risk groups are straight lines (in a logarithmic scale) running nearly exactly in parallel. This remarkable parallelism can be understood only if the spread of AIDS is independent of the sexual or drug risk in a certain sense. On the other hand, the drastic overrepresentation of the sexually highly active groups and drug abusers in the number of AIDS cases obviously requires that the transmission of AIDS unequivocally depends on the sexual and drug risk. We present a mathematical model that is suitable to reconcile this apparent contradiction in the interpretation of the epidemiological data: the observed parallel time series for the spread of AIDS in groups with different risk of infection can be realized by computer simulation, if one assumes that the outbreak of full-blown AIDS only occurs if HIV and a certain infectious coagent (cofactor) CO are present. Such a situation is not uncommon, see, e.g. the influenza virus--Staphylococcus aureus system. According to the mathematical model this cofactor would spread independently of the sexual and drug risk--in contrast to HIV. However, due to its analytical properties the simulated cofactor cannot be identified so far with any known infectious agent."

        "abstract": "The fetal brain disruption sequence is a recognizable pattern of defects that includes moderate to profound microcephaly, overlapping sutures, occipital bone prominence, and scalp rugae. The condition is postulated to arise from partial brain disruption during the second or third trimester with subsequent fetal skull collapse resulting from decreased intracranial hydrostatic pressure. Proposed causes include prenatal viral or parasitic infections and vascular disruptions. We report seven infants with the fetal brain disruption sequence. Two of these patients died. A changing phenotype with time was seen in three. Recognition of this phenotype is critical because the condition has a uniformly poor prognosis for infants but the recurrence risk in future pregnancies is low."

        "abstract": "Two-year-old male mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) received a control diet (0.2 ppm Se) or diets containing 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32 ppm Se as selenomethionine for 14 wk. Se accumulated readily in the liver in a dose-dependent manner, reaching a mean concentration of 29 ppm (wet weight) in the 32 ppm group. Dietary Se of 2 ppm or greater increased plasma glutathione peroxidase activity. Mortality (10%) and histopathological effects, including bile duct hyperplasia and hemosiderin pigmentation of the liver and spleen, occurred in the 32 ppm group. These histopathological effects were accompanied by lower hemoglobin concentrations (16 and 32 ppm groups) and hematocrit (32 ppm group), and elevated plasma alkaline phosphatase activity (32 ppm group) indicative of cholestatic liver injury. Other manifestations of hepatotoxicity included significant linear dose responses for hepatic oxidized glutathione (GSSG) concentrations and ratio of GSSG to reduced glutathione (GSH). Means for both of these responses differed from controls in groups receiving 8-32 ppm Se. Mean hepatic GSH and malondialdehyde (a measure of lipid peroxidation) concentrations were significantly elevated in the 16 and 32 ppm groups. Subchronic effects of selenomethionine, which occurs in vegetation, are of particular interest with respect to the health of wild aquatic birds in seleniferous locations."

        "abstract": "House dust mites allergens are one of the most common antigens able to induce a high degree of sensitization in a general population. Owing to the possibility of quantifying the amount of major mite allergens in the environment, epidemiological studies have led to propose threshold values above which there is an increased risk for the occurrence of mite sensitizing, for the development of asthma and for the occurrence of symptoms. All these studies and some others dealing with the number of mites in house dust support the hypothesis that exposure to house dust mites may have a major influence on developing allergic diseases."

        "abstract": "Exposure to whole-body irradiation is associated with fatal gram-negative sepsis. The effect of oral therapy with three quinolones, pefloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and ofloxacin, for orally acquired Klebsiella pneumoniae infection was tested in B6D2F1 mice exposed to 8.0 Gy whole-body irradiation from bilaterally positioned 60Co sources. A dose of 10(8) organisms was given orally 2 days after irradiation, and therapy was started 1 day later. Quinolones reduced colonization of the ileum with K. pneumoniae: 16 of 28 (57%) untreated mice harbored the organisms, compared to only 12 of 90 (13%) mice treated with quinolones (P less than 0.005). K. pneumoniae was isolated from the livers of 6 of 28 untreated mice, compared to only 1 of 90 treated mice (P less than 0.001). Only 5 of 20 (25%) untreated mice survived for at least 30 days compared with 17 of 20 (85%) mice treated with ofloxacin, 15 of 20 (75%) mice treated with pefloxacin, and 14 of 20 (70%) treated with ciprofloxacin (P less than 0.05). These data illustrate the efficacy of quinolones for oral therapy of orally acquired K. pneumoniae infection in irradiated hosts."

        "abstract": "A digital TV tomography system, capable of retrospective reconstruction of multiple digital tomographic images, has been developed and its basic physical characteristics have been evaluated. The multiple tomographic images were formed through retrospective reconstruction of digital data acquired on a linear tomographic x-ray unit and an image intensifier-television system. Digital data were obtained with a series of 30 pulsed exposures during linear motion of the system. A distortion correction algorithm for the convex surface of the image intensifier was developed in order to reduce image distortion. A phantom study showed that the square-wave response at the fulcrum plane was slightly inferior to that in conventional tomography. There was also a slight decrease in the square-wave response away from the fulcrum plane and upon application of a correction algorithm, as compared with the response of the original reconstructed image at the fulcrum plane. The exposure dose for a single image was approximately half that in conventional tomography. Because of many advantages, including low exposure, short examination time, digital image manipulation, and applicability to picture archiving and communication systems, this is likely to become an important method in radiology when further technical refinements have been made."

Remarkable shifts in the flora were apparent. Sites with low or extremely low initial levels of A.a. (less than 10%) showed an increase in mean proportions from 2.7% to 15.7% (p less than 0.01). A.a. was eliminated in only 18% of sites after 1 week of minocycline therapy. Subgingival scaling resulted in 80% of sites without detectable A.a. However, if present, the organism accounted for 51% of the cultivable microflora, on average. Our data emphasize the importance of a sufficiently extended period of antibiotic therapy and efficient mechanical debridement of all tooth surfaces to eliminate the organism."

        "abstract": "The complete structure of the mouse 68-kDa neurofilament (NF-L) gene was elucidated. We cloned cDNAs corresponding to 3.5- and 2.3-kb NF-L mRNA, including their polyadenylation sites. Sequence analysis revealed that these NF-L mRNAs arose from the alternative use of two polyadenylation sites in exon 4. Promoter analysis using NF-L promoter-beta-galactosidase fusion plasmids determined regions responsible for its basic promoter activity, which were located between -328 and -36 base pairs from the transcription initiation site. These promoter fusion plasmids induced a significant level of beta-galactosidase in NF-nonproducing C6 cells as well as in NF-producing PC12h cells. The in vitro transcription assay using HeLa cell extract also showed that this promoter exhibited strong transcriptional activity. Little difference in NF-L mRNA stability was observed between the two cells. However, nuclear run-off assay revealed that the NF-L gene was not transcribed in NF-nonproducing C6 cells. These data suggest that the strong promoter activity of the NF-L gene is repressed in vivo at the transcription initiation level in a tissue-specific manner."

        "abstract": "Previous experiments suggest that mitotic chromosome segregation in some fungi is a nonrandom process in which chromatids of the same replicative age are destined for cosegregation. We have investigated the pattern of chromatid segregation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by labeling the DNA of a strain auxotrophic for thymidine with 5-bromodeoxyuridine. The fate of DNA strands was followed qualitatively by immunofluorescence microscopy and quantitatively by microphotometry using an anti-5-bromodeoxyuridine monoclonal antibody. Chromatids of the same replicative age were distributed randomly to daughter cells at mitosis. Quantitative measurements showed that the amount of fluorescence in the daughter nuclei derived from parents with hemilabeled chromosomes diminished in intensity by one half. The concentration of 5-bromodeoxyuridine used in the experiments had little effect on the frequency of either homologous or sister chromatid exchanges. We infer that the 5-bromodeoxyuridine was distributed randomly due to mitotic segregation of chromatids and not via sister chromatid exchanges."

        "abstract": "1. The increase in glomerular filtration rate after a protein meal is believed to be mediated by hormonal factors. Since natriuresis is often observed after a protein meal, it was postulated that the increase in glomerular filtration rate after a protein meal might be mediated by atrial natriuretic peptide. 2. Subjects were given a low, medium or high protein meal. Fluid intake was controlled so as to avoid significant extracellular fluid volume expansion. It was found that the creatinine clearance, the urea excretion, the fractional sodium excretion and the potassium excretion were elevated in all subjects after protein meals (P less than 0.05). These effects were not observed in subjects given a carbohydrate control meal. 3. The plasma atrial natriuretic peptide concentrations remained unchanged in all subjects except those given a high protein meal (P less than 0.05). There was no significant relationship between plasma atrial natriuretic peptide concentrations and creatinine clearance before or after a protein meal. 4. The data suggest that a high protein meal induces a minor increase in plasma atrial natriuretic peptide concentration, whereas a low or medium protein meal does not. It is unlikely that the change in creatinine clearance after a protein meal can be explained by a change in plasma atrial natriuretic peptide levels."

In all 5 direction selective complex cells and one orientation selective simple cell successfully studied, visually evoked excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) were tuned to the preferred direction or orientation. Visually evoked inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) were also tuned to the preferred direction/orientation of stimulus. IPSPs evoked by the non-preferred stimulus when present were smaller than those evoked by the preferred stimulus. IPSPs were undetected in two of the 5 cells tested. These results suggest that directionally/orientationally tuned EPSPs make a major contribution to stimulus specificity in visual cortical neurons but IPSPs evoked by a stimulus with null-direction/orientation may sharpen the stimulus specificity."

As a result of the sigma-electron-withdrawing effect of the Cl atom at the meta position in the phenyl ring with respect to the thiosemicarbazide chain, the net negative charge on the terminal N atom decreases compared to the p-chloro and p-methoxy derivatives. The antibacterial activity of the compound is also lowered."

        "abstract": "To elucidate the organization of the human genomic sequences encoding CTP synthetase (CTPS), fragments homologous to the cDNA were isolated from genomic lambda libraries. The fragments cloned were overlapping and cover over 40 kb. Cotransfection of the DNAs into CTPS-deficient, cytidine-requiring CHO mutants can transform them to cytidine-independent growth, indicating that the complete structural gene has been isolated. Direct sequencing and enzymatic amplification of the cloned genomic fragments revealed that the coding sequences are distributed to 19 exons covering about 35 kb. Multiple transcriptional start sites were detected by primer extension in a G + C-rich 5' flanking sequence that is separated from the translational start by an approximately 3-kb intron. A panel of human-rodent somatic cell hybrids and the CTPS cDNA were used to assign the structural gene to the short arm of human chromosome 1. This assignment was further refined through the use of somatic cell hybrids bearing fragments of the short arm of the chromosome, allowing localization to 1p36.11-p31, a region notable for its disruption in many types of tumors."

        "abstract": "One-day-old, awake infants underwent an olfactory classical conditioning procedure to assess associative learning within the olfactory system of newborns. Experimental infants received ten 30-second pairings of a novel olfactory conditioned stimulus (a citrus odor of neutral value) and tactile stimulation provided by stroking as the reinforcing unconditioned stimulus (a stimulus with positive properties). Control babies received only the odor, only the stroking, or the stroking followed by the odor presentation. The next day, all infants, in either the awake or sleep state, were given five 30-second presentations of the odor. Results were analyzed from video tapes scored by an observer unaware of the infants' training condition. The results indicate that only those infants who received the forward pairings of the odor and stroking exhibited conditioned responding (head turning toward the odor) to the citrus odor. The performance of the conditioned response was not affected by the state of the baby during testing, because both awake and sleeping infants exhibited conditioned responses. Furthermore, the expression of the conditioned response was odor specific; a novel floral odor presented during testing did not elicit conditioned responses in the experimental babies. These results suggest that complex associative olfactory learning is seen in newborns within the first 48 hours of life. These baseline findings may serve as normative data against which observation from neonates at risk for neurological sequelae may be compared."

        "abstract": "Immediate post-training intraperitoneal injections of the GABA antagonist bicuculline (0.25 or 0.5 mg/kg) or of the GABA agonist muscimol (1.0 or 2.0 mg/kg) improved and impaired, respectively, retention of CD1 mice tested 24 h after training in a one-trial inhibitory avoidance task. Administration of bicuculline or muscimol prior to the retention test did not modify retention latencies of mice that had received either saline or the same drug immediately after training. These findings indicate that the effects of post-training administration of bicuculline and muscimol on retention are not state dependent and, thus, argue against a general state-dependency interpretation of the effects of post-training treatments affecting retention. The findings are consistent with previous evidence indicating that GABAergic drugs affect retention through influences on memory storage processes."

        "abstract": "The anti-hypertensive effect of ketanserin, a new antagonist of 5-HT2-serotonergic receptors, was evaluated in 10 patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension. At the end of 2 weeks of placebo wash-out and following 2 and 4 weeks of treatment with ketanserin (20 mg twice daily), blood pressure and heart rate were measured both in the supine and standing position. In addition, before and at the end of treatment, plasma renin activity (PRA), plasma concentration of aldosterone and the nocturnal urinary excretion of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and TXB2, the two metabolites that largely reflect the renal synthesis of prostacyclin and thromboxane, respectively, were determined. The study was carried out in a metabolic ward where the intake of sodium was adjusted to 100-120 mmol day-1. Ketanserin significantly reduced blood pressure both in the supine and standing position with no significant change of heart rate. The treatment did not produce any variation of PRA, aldosterone, urinary excretion of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha or TXB2. These results indicate that ketanserin reduces blood pressure without interfering with the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system or the renal synthesis of prostacyclin and thromboxane."

        "abstract": "The basis of extracellular acidosis amelioration of 2-bromohydroquinone (BHQ)-induced renal proximal tubular cell death was determined by comparing the metabolism, uptake and mitochondrial effects of BHQ (0.2 mM) and bromoquinone (BQ) (0.05 mM) on isolated rabbit renal proximal tubules incubated in pH 7.4 and pH 6.4 buffers. Exposure of proximal tubules in pH 7.4 buffer to [14C]BHQ resulted in a time-dependent increase in covalently bound BHQ-equivalents to tubular protein (9 +/- 1 nmol/mg of protein at 1 hr) and a decrease in nystatin-stimulated oxygen consumption (NYS-QO2). In comparison, covalently bound BHQ-equivalents were 0.7 nmol/mg of protein and NYS-QO2 was unaffected in proximal tubules incubated at pH 6.4 for 1 hr. After a 1-hr exposure, tubular content of [14C]BHQ-equivalents was 15 +/- 2 and 9 +/- 1 nmol/mg of protein in tubules incubated at pH 7.4 and 6.4, respectively. Thus, decreased covalent binding of BHQ-equivalents in proximal tubules incubated at pH 6.4 could not be accounted for by limited uptake of BHQ. The lactate dehydrogenase release induced by 0.05 mM BQ was decreased by acidic pH. Similarly, BQ induced an 85% decrease in NYS-QO2 of proximal tubules in pH 7.4 buffer, compared to a 55% inhibition when proximal tubules were incubated at pH 6.4 for 4 hr. Thus, extracellular acidosis ameliorates BHQ toxicity by altering BHQ biotransformation; that is, extracellular acidosis inhibits the oxidation of BHQ to BQ and may promote the reduction of BQ to BHQ."

        "abstract": "A membrane-bound cytochrome b, a heterodimer formed by a 91-kD glycoprotein (heavy chain) and a 22-kD polypeptide (light chain), is an essential component of the phagocyte NADPH-oxidase responsible for superoxide generation. Cytochrome b is absent in two subgroups of chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), an inherited disorder characterized by the lack of oxidase activity. Mutations in the cytochrome heavy chain gene, encoded by the CYBB locus in Xp21.1, result in the X-linked form of CGD. A rare subgroup of autosomal recessive CGD also lacks cytochrome b (A- CGD), but the genetic defect has not previously been identified. In order to search for possible mutations in the cytochrome light chain locus, CYBA, the structure of this gene was characterized. The CYBA locus was localized to 16q24, and the approximately 600-bp open reading frame determined to be encoded by six exons that span approximately 8.5 kb. Three unrelated patients with A- CGD were studied for evidence of mutations in the light chain gene. One patient, whose parents were first cousins, was homozygous for a large deletion that removed all but the extreme 5' coding sequence of the gene. The other two patients had a grossly normal light chain transcript on Northern blot of mononuclear cell RNA. The light chain transcript was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and sequenced. One patient was a compound heterozygote for two alleles containing point mutations in the open reading frame that predict a frame shift and a nonconservative amino acid replacement, respectively. The second patient, whose parents were second cousins, was homozygous for a different single-base substitution resulting in another nonconservative amino acid change. These results indicate that A- CGD can results from defects in the gene encoding the 22-kD light chain of the phagocyte cytochrome b."

        "abstract": "We report here on advances made in the construction of plasmid shuttle vectors suitable for genetic manipulations in both Escherichia coli and halobacteria. Starting with a 20.4-kb construct, pMDS1, new vectors were engineered which were considerably smaller yet retained several alternative cloning sites. A restriction barrier observed when plasmid DNA was transferred into Haloferax volcanii cells was found to operate via adenine methylation, resulting in a 10(3) drop in transformation efficiency and the loss of most constructs by incorporation of the resistance marker into the chromosome. Passing shuttle vectors through E. coli dam mutants effectively avoided this barrier. Deletion analysis revealed that the gene(s) for autonomous replication of pHK2 (the plasmid endogenous to Haloferax strain Aa2.2 and used in the construction of pMDS1) was located within a 4.2-kb SmaI-KpnI fragment. Convenient restriction sites were identified near the termini of the novobiocin resistance determinant (gyrB), allowing the removal of flanking sequences (including gyrA). These deletions did not appear to significantly affect transformation efficiencies or the novobiocin resistance phenotype of halobacterial transformants. Northern blot hybridization with strand- and gene-specific probes identified a single gyrB-gyrA transcript of 4.7 kb. This is the first demonstration in prokaryotes that the two subunits of DNA gyrase may be cotranscribed."

        "abstract": "A Thematic Aperception Test was used with 13 male and 16 female patients who were requesting A.I.D. The following main psychological reactions were found in women: anxiety and depression (fear of rejection by their family and friends; lowering the image of the husband--the donor being considered as a rival), aggression (the narcissistic woman \"demands\" A.I.D.; the donor is esteemed highly); mother is protective (\"true\" paternity comes through love of the child and the need to forget the donor). They found, in men: an inability to abandon fertility as lost (with denial of sterility); ambivalence, castration anxiety and a feeling of being excluded from the mother-child symbiosis with later acceptance of loss of fertility and (sometimes excessively) identification with the \"mother\". Most subjects studied were not intending telling the child about his true origin; because disclosure would be tantamount to transgressing twice over the laws of paternity and the rules against Oedipus behaviour. There is often a great difference between the ways the partners view the matter and inter-relate. We strongly recommend that psychological advice should be taken before treatment with A.I.D. is started."

The pulsatile flow of water-glycerol mixture containing talcum particles was maintained by an artificial circulatory device. The Doppler ultrasound system was used to measure flow characteristics. The background (remote from the stenosis) values were studied by dispersion analysis. The dependence of the values in the area of stenosis upon the degrees of stenosis was described by the parabolic function. The combination of the function with an upper 95% background limit shows that the method records luminal changes nearly by 20%."

        "article_title": "Extracellular dopamine increases in the neonatal olfactory bulb during odor preference training.",
        "abstract": "Young rats learn to approach an odor that has been paired with tactile stimulation. This attraction is accompanied by changes in the metabolism and anatomy within the olfactory bulb glomerular layer. In this study, we examined the changes that occur in the olfactory bulb during early olfactory learning, rather than after such pairings have occurred. Specifically, we determined whether the pairing of an odor with tactile stimulation would produce a modified response by olfactory bulb glomerular-layer neurons. To monitor one large subgroup of these neurons during early learning, we used in vivo microdialysis to assess the activity of dopaminergic neurons in the olfactory bulb of postnatal day (PND) 3 rats during simultaneous presentation of odor and tactile stimulation, tactile stimulation alone, odor alone, or clean air alone. Clean air evokes no change in extracellular dopamine (DA), while both odor alone and stroking alone induce prolonged increases in DA peaking at about 200% of baseline. The combination of odor and tactile stimulation, which allows an olfactory preference to be formed, induces a prolonged increase in DA which peaks at about 400% of baseline. The level of the DA metabolite 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) increases only in pups receiving both odor and tactile stimulation and peaks at about 200% of baseline. With the exception of the pups exposed to clean air, all groups show an increase in homovanillic acid (HVA) of between 150-200% following stimulation. The large and prolonged increase in DA may be linked to the longer term anatomical and physiological changes in the glomerular layer of the bulb that form as a consequence of early olfactory preference training."

Serovar Aedih was predominant among both serogroup WI PPNG (80%) and non-PPNG (100%) strains. Serogroup WII/III PPNG strains were represented by nine serovars with the predominant serovars being Bacjk (28%) and Bcgjk (16%). Eleven serovars were identified in the WII/III non-PPNG strains and the major serovars were Bajk (20%), Bacjk (17%), Back (11.4%) and Beghjk (11.4%). Analysis of the 25 PPNG strains showed that 16 of them carried the 4.4 MDa (Asian type) resistance plasmid and nine strains harboured the 4.4 MDa plasmid in conjunction with the 24.5 MDa transfer plasmid. The cryptic plasmid of 2.6 MDa was present in 27 of the 35 non-PPNG strains. Five of the non-PPNG strains harbouring the cryptic plasmid also contained the 24.5 MDa transfer plasmid.

        "abstract": "A total of 43 breast cancer patients were treated at the Department of Radiation Oncology, Mackay Memorial Hospital from January 1978 to December 1987 for postoperative local-regional recurrence. Twenty-six patients developed local recurrence within 12 months after surgery and 17 patients developed local recurrence after 12 months. The mean age for this group of patients was 52 years (range: 27-82). There were 26 postmenopausal and 17 premenopausal patients. Twenty-four patients had received chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil (CMF) regimen. Four patients were excluded from this study due to incompletion of radiotherapy. Sites of local recurrence in the remaining 39 patients included: chest wall, single (8) and multiple (4); axilla (7); supraclavicular area (5); chest wall with regional node (11); and multiple regional nodes (4). All were free of distant metastasis at the initiation of radiotherapy. A mean tumor dose of 5000 cGy in 28 fractions was given over a 6-week period to the chest wall and draining lymphatics, using an AECL Theratron 80 or a CGR Alcyon MEV Cobalt-60 unit. The overall local control rate was 72%, and the 5-year local control rate was 59%. Nine patients experienced a second local recurrence, with a median interval of 8 months after radiotherapy. Four of them (4/9) also showed evidence of systemic disease at the same time. Distant metastasis, the major cause of mortality, appeared in 49% of the patients with a median interval of 22.8 months after radiotherapy. The three leading sites of distant metastasis were the bones (42%), lungs (37%) and liver (16%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

        "abstract": "Tracheobronchial mucin samples from control and cystic fibrosis patients were purified by gel filtration chromatography on Sephacryl S-1000 and by density gradient centrifugation. Normal secretions contained high molecular weight (approximately 10(7] mucins, whereas the cystic fibrosis secretions contained relatively small amounts of high molecular weight mucin together with larger quantities of lower molecular weight mucin fragments. These probably represent products of protease digestion. Reducing the disulfide bonds in either the control or cystic fibrosis high molecular weight mucin fractions released subunits of approximately 2000 kDa. Treating these subunits with trypsin released glycopeptides of 300 kDa. Trypsin treatment of unreduced mucin also released fragments of 2000 kDa that could be converted into 300-kDa glycopeptides upon disulfide bond reduction. Thus, protease-susceptible linkages within these mucins must be cross-linked by disulfide bonds so that the full effects of proteolytic degradation of mucins remain cryptic until disulfide bonds are reduced. Since various combinations of protease treatment and disulfide bond reduction release either 2000- or 300-kDa fragments, these fragments must represent important elements of mucin structure. The high molecular weight fractions of cystic fibrosis mucins appear to be indistinguishable from control mucins. Their amino acid compositions are the same, and various combinations of disulfide bond reduction and protease treatment release products of identical size and amino acid composition. Sulfate and carbohydrate compositions did vary considerably from sample to sample, but the limited number of samples tested did not demonstrate a cystic fibrosis-specific pattern. Thus, tracheobronchial mucins from cystic fibrosis and control patients are very similar, and both share the same generalized structure previously determined for salivary, cervical, and intestinal mucins."

The interstitium was well preserved. After five cycles of a combination chemotherapy, CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone), the second biopsy revealed that tumor cells disappeared from glomeruli showing mild sclerosis.

        "abstract": "Electrodes modified by the electrodeposition of poly(3-methylthiophene) were used as chemical sensors for some organic and biological molecules of industrial and medicinal interest. The electrochemical behaviors of ferri/ferrocyanide, catechol, ascorbic acid, hydroquinone, dopamine epinephrine, acetaminophen, p-aminophenol and NADH were examined by cyclic voltammetry. The results showed that the proposed modified surface catalyzes the oxidation of these compounds. Differential pulse and square wave techniques were used for the analysis of binary mixture of ascorbic acid with catechol, NADH, dopamine and p-aminophenol. Voltammetric peak resolution was also demonstrated for a ternary mixture of ascorbic acid, catechol and p-aminophenol. Polymer coated electrode was also used in an amperometric detector for flow injection analysis of most of the aforementioned compounds. The responses of the polymer electrode were 4-10 times larger as compared to those of platinum. The modified electrode displayed excellent response stability for successive injections and detection limits were 10 ppb for catechol, dopamine, epinephrine, NADH and p-aminophenol, 1 ppb for acetaminophen and 100 ppb for ascorbic acid. Voltammetric peak positions were affected by the nature of the electrolyte and its pH. Also, film thicknesses were shown to be a factor affecting both the current magnitudes and oxidation peak potential of NADH."

        "abstract": "When quiescent cells are stimulated with growth factors, phorbol esters, okadaic acid, or protein synthesis inhibitors, the early-response genes, which include c-fos and c-jun, are rapidly induced. The earliest growth factor- and phorbol ester-stimulated nuclear signaling events concomitant with proto-oncogene induction are the rapid phosphorylation of two chromatin-associated proteins, pp33 and pp15. We show here that the tumor promoter okadaic acid, which inhibits protein phosphatases 1 and 2A, and the protein synthesis inhibitors anisomycin and cycloheximide also stimulate pp33 and pp15 phosphorylation. Using transcriptional inhibitors, we show that this response is not a consequence of early gene induction. By peptide mapping and microsequencing, chromatin-associated pp15 is identified as histone H3. Upon stimulation, histone H3 is rapidly phosphorylated on serine residues within its highly charged, basic N-terminal domain. Thus, these diverse agents elicit a common early nuclear signal modulating nucleosomal structure or function, potentially contributing to conformational regulation of proto-oncogene induction."

The motoneurons innervating the five tentorio-scapal muscles M4 and M5 and the two scapo-pedicellar muscles M6 and M7 were stained with cobalt chloride introduced via the cut axonal endings in the muscle. The seven antennal muscles are innervated by a total of 17 excitatory motoneurons and one common inhibitory neuron. These neurons branch in the dorsal neuropil of the deuto- and tritocerebrum. No difference in the morphology of the motoneurons between the two species was evident. Two dorsal-unpaired-medial (DUM) neurons located in the suboesophageal ganglion also innervate the antennal muscles. Intracellular recordings of some motoneurons combined with Lucifer Yellow injections corroborated the motoneuron morphology obtained by cobalt backfilling from the muscles. The recordings showed that the motoneurons are either of the fast or the slow type."

        "abstract": "Triggering of eosinophil secretory and cytotoxic functions by stimulation of the IgG and IgE FcR is thought to have major importance in the pathophysiology of tissue eosinophilia. We studied the ability of human rIL-4 to regulate this triggering event in human eosinophils. At doses ranging from 0.1 to 10 pg/ml, IL-4 suppressed eosinophil secretion of beta-glucuronidase and arylsulfatase by up to 65% after stimulation with IgG-coated Sepharose beads. This effect required prolonged preincubation (16 h) of eosinophils with IL-4; no effect was detected after 1 h preincubation. Enzyme secretion stimulated by IgE-coated beads was not affected. Further, IL-4 (after 16 h preincubation), suppressed eosinophil antibody-dependent killing of schistosomula (Schistosoma mansoni) targets by 24 to 39% in four experiments (p less than 0.05). Flow microfluorimetry analysis showed that IL-4 reduced the expression of IgG FcR, but not IgE FcR, suggesting that this mechanism underlies the suppression of IgG-mediated secretion. Taken collectively, these results demonstrate a mechanism for T lymphocyte suppression of IgG-stimulated eosinophil functions via IL-4."

        "abstract": "We studied the relations between reported alcohol use and the incidence of hospitalization for several types of cerebrovascular disease. Daily consumption of three or more drinks, but not lighter drinking, was related to higher hospitalization rates for hemorrhagic cerebrovascular disease, especially intracerebral hemorrhage. Age, blood pressure, and black race were other independent predictors of hemorrhagic events; higher blood pressure appeared to be a partial mediator of the relation between alcohol use and hemorrhagic events. Alcohol use was associated with lower hospitalization rates for occlusive cerebrovascular disease; an inverse relation was present in both sexes, whites and blacks, and for extracranial and intracerebral occlusive lesions. Other predictors of hospitalization for occlusive disease included age, blood pressure, smoking, blood glucose and total cholesterol concentrations, and baseline disease. Our data suggest that heavier drinking increases the risk of hemorrhagic cerebrovascular events, but that alcohol use may lessen the risk of occlusive lesions."

        "abstract": "Agonist regulation of platelet alpha 2-adrenoceptors was examined in human volunteers after acute elevations of adrenoceptor agonist and during chronic elevation of plasma catecholamines in two patients with phaeochromocytoma. Platelet alpha 2-adrenoceptor number was measured by radioligand binding [( 3H]yohimbine) and alpha 2-adrenoceptor function measured by turbidimetric platelet aggregation. Short term infusion of adrenoceptor agonists with alpha 2 activity caused reductions in the platelet response to adrenaline in vitro; conversely an increase in activity was observed postoperatively in two patients after removal of phaeochromocytoma. The changes in platelet response were not accompanied by changes in alpha 2-adrenoceptor number. It is proposed that a process of receptor inactivation occurs during desensitization and this is responsible for the dynamic regulation of platelet responses."

        "article_title": "Carotid surgery under cervical block anesthesia. A simple method of heart and brain protection in high risk patients.",
        "abstract": "Between January 1, 1985, and December 15, 1987, 60 patients underwent surgery for carotid lesions under local cervical block anesthesia. Sixty-seven reconstruction procedures were performed including 64 endarterectomies and 3 vein bypasses. During the same 3 year period, 938 other reconstruction procedures were carried out under general anesthesia for a total of 1005 procedures. These 60 patients, who accounted for 6.7% of our indications, were selected for surgery under local anesthesia because they were at high risk for cardiac and neurologic complications. As far as staging is concerned, this subgroup of patients included: 14 asymptomatic cases (stage 0), i.e., 21%; 44 transient ischemic attacks (stage I), i.e., 66%; 2 progressive stroke (stage II), i.e., 3%; 7 patients with neurologic sequels (stage III), i.e., 10%. In all 79% of the patients were symptomatic. The asymptomatic patients all presented bilateral tight stenosis sometimes with thrombosis of the contralateral carotid. The technique of local anesthesia and endarterectomy were classic: closing with a bougie to calibrate the lumen, systematic intraoperative arteriography and immediate correction of technical failures (2 times); no death occurred among the patients in stages 0, 1 and II; 1 early asymptomatic occlusion that was not corrected was noted; in one case, a ligation of the carotid was necessary after technical failure, without consequences; one death occurred in stage III after intracerebral hemorrhage. On the basis of our experience local cervical block anesthesia appears to be a simple and reliable method of ensuring intraoperative diagnosis of cerebral ischemia. It eliminates all intraoperative cerebral complications secondary to ischemia and allows a better understanding of the physiopathologic mechanisms underlying perioperative neurologic complications. The absence of neurologic and cardiac complications in this series of very high risk patients enables us to extend eligibility for surgery to include patients with unstable cardiac and cerebral disease."

        "abstract": "Fluorescence microscopy and analytical subcellular fractionation were used to investigate the hepatic localisation of haematoporphyrin derivative (HPD) after intraperitoneal administration. HPD was found to rapidly accumulate in the liver and then to slowly decline over 48 hr. Fluorescence microscopy showed that although at early times porphyrins could not be localised to a particular cell type, at 24 hr porphyrins were preferentially localised to the Kupffer cells of the liver. Subcellular fractionation studies indicated that the initial rapid uptake of HPD was to the cytosol. However, at 24 hr, porphyrins appeared to be localised to lysosomes. Lysosomal localisation was confirmed using the selective organelle perturbant, Triton WR 1339. No evidence was found either at the light microscope level or by subcellular fractionation to suggest association of HPD with other organelles. HPLC analysis showed that the porphyrins present in the plasma and in the cytosol and lysosome fractions were mainly the (RS, SR) and (RR, SS) diastereoisomers of haematoporphyrin and the two position isomers 8-(1-hydroxyethyl)-3-vinyldeuteroporphyrin and 3-(1-hydroxyethyl)-8-vinyldeuteroporphyrin. There was no evidence for the involvement of dimers such as dihaematoporphyrin ether."

        "abstract": "Vasopressin was used in ten critically ill patients with massive intra-abdominal bleeding unresponsive to conventional therapy. Vasopressin controlled bleeding in four patients, three of whom had continued to bleed following laparotomy for haemostasis; in two other patients, bleeding was reduced. All the patients were intensively monitored throughout the period of the vasopressin treatment; this enabled other physiological effects of vasopressin to be documented and reported. Mean arterial pressure and central venous pressure increased following the administration of vasopressin and there was a decrease in heart rate. Core body temperature rose significantly. Although all the patients had impaired renal function before receiving vasopressin, five had a prompt diuresis following its administration. Eight patients died but only three of intra-abdominal bleeding; two patients survived to leave hospital. Four patients had post-mortem evidence of ischaemia in the heart, liver and gastrointestinal tract; vasopressin may have contributed to the development of this. Vasopressin may have a place in the management of patients with life-threatening intra-abdominal haemorrhage but its use should be confined to those patients in whom conventional therapy has failed."

The findings point to the importance of a precise anamnesis, as in its mild form the traumatism is often poorly recognized, and may be incorrectly diagnosed. It is therefore recommended that a thorough clinical examination be carried out, with abdominal ultrasonography, X-ray barium and tomodensitometry if necessary. Frequently, as is the case with other abdominal, injuries, surgery may be avoided if the patient's condition is carefully followed."

Although natriuresis associated with SVT may be secondary to the augmented secretion of ANP, whether or not physiologic changes other than natriuresis can be attributed to the release of ANP has not been determined. In the present study, plasma ANP levels in 10 patients with SVT were found to be significantly (p less than 0.05) increased, from 37 +/- 11 pg/ml (mean +/- standard error of the mean) during the control period to 160 +/- 54 pg/ml at 60 minutes after the induction of SVT. Urinary sodium excretion, although insignificant, tended to increase during the 30-minute period after SVT termination. The filtration fraction determined by the ratio of creatinine to para-aminohippurate clearance significantly increased during SVT. An increase in capillary permeability seemed to have occurred as there was a rise of hematocrit, the changes of which showed a different time course from that of the urine volume. The ratio of plasma aldosterone concentration to plasma renin activity significantly decreased during SVT. As the same effects are observed after ANP infusion, these changes were attributed to ANP activity."

        "abstract": "Twelve patients with primary lymphomas of the central nervous system were treated in the Department of Radiation Oncology, Yonsei University College of Medicine, between 1976 and 1987. There were seven males and five females ranging from 19 to 63 years of age. They had single (6 cases) or multiple (6 cases) discrete intracerebral nodules. All patients were treated with radiation therapy. Surgical resection was performed in five cases and intrathecal chemotherapy with methotrexate was performed in seven cases after radiotherapy. All patients except one had received whole brain irradiation with a median dose of 4000 cGy. The radiation dose for a primary tumor was 4800-6000 cGy (median 5560 cGy). Initial response to radiation was excellent with a 91.7% complete response rate, but late recurrences were noted and the median survival was 42.3 months. Intracranial recurrences were observed in two patients who received less than 4000 cGy to the whole brain without intrathecal chemotherapy. Although intracranial recurrence was not seen in the patients receiving intrathecal chemotherapy after radiation, a high incidence of necrotizing leukoencephalopathy was noted. High dose irradiation with a minimum of 4000 cGy to the whole brain and more than 5000 cGy to the primary tumor is recommended for the treatment of primary CNS lymphomas. Combined use of chemotherapy should be carefully attempted because of the increased toxicity."

A modified Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and a Beck Depression Inventory were administered before treatment, after treatment # 7, and 2 weeks after phototherapy was terminated. Analysis of variance with repeated measures revealed a significant interaction between sex of the patient, intensity of the lights, and day of rating for scores on both the modified Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and the Beck Depression Inventory. For both measures, the interaction occurred because all groups showed a decrease in depression ratings during the phototherapy exposure period, but only females at the higher intensity continued to have low depression scores 2 weeks after light treatment had stopped. These data indicate that bright light at both high (2000 lux) and low (300 lux) intensities is able to reduce depression in patients with seasonal affective disorder. The data also indicate that both sex of the patient and intensity of the light may interact to determine the latency to relapse."

        "abstract": "To study the mechanisms underlying covert orienting of attention in visual space, subjects were given advance cues indicating the probable locations of targets that they had to discriminate and localize. Direct peripheral cues (brightening of one of four boxes in peripheral vision) and symbolic central cues (an arrow at the fixation point indicating a probable peripheral box) were compared. Peripheral and central cues are believed to activate different reflexive and voluntary modes of orienting (Jonides, 1981; Posner, 1980). Experiment 1 showed that the time courses of facilitation and inhibition from peripheral and central cues were characteristic and different. Experiment 2 showed that voluntary orienting in response to symbolic central cues is interrupted by reflexive orienting to random peripheral flashes. Experiment 3 showed that irrelevant peripheral flashes also compete with relevant peripheral cues. The amount of interference varied systematically with the interval between the onset of the relevant cue and of the distracting flash (cue-flash onset asynchrony) and with the cuing condition. Taken together, these effects support a model for spatial attention with distinct but interacting reflexive and voluntary orienting mechanisms."

        "abstract": "A glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 63,000 has been purified, in an active form, from human placental villus tissue membranes. The binding properties of this glycoprotein to opioid alkaloids and peptides indicates that it is the kappa opiate receptor of human placenta. The receptor binds the tritiated ligands etorphine, bremazocine, ethylketocyclazocine and naloxone specifically and reversibly with Kd values of 3.3, 4.4, 5.1 and 7.0nM, respectively. The binding of 3H-Bremazocine to the purified receptor is inhibited by the following compounds with the corresponding Ki values EKC, 1.3 x 10(-8)M; Dynorphin 1-8, 3.03 x 10(-7); U50,488H, 4.48 x 10(-9); U69-593,2.28 x 10(-8), morphine, 4.05 x 10(-6) DADLE, 6.47 x 10(-6) and naloxone, 2.64 x 10(-8). The purified receptor binds 8 nmole of 3H-Etorphine and 1.7 nmole 3H-BZC per mg protein. The theoretical binding capacity of a protein of this molecular weight is 15.8. Although the iodinated purified receptor appears by autoradiography as one band on SDS-PAGE, yet homogeneity of the preparation is not claimed."

        "abstract": "The mechanism whereby glucagon causes an increase in the concentration of cytoplasmic free Ca2+, [Ca2+]c, in isolated hepatocytes has been investigated. There have been proposals of cyclic-AMP-dependent and cyclic-AMP-independent mechanisms. In this work, the inactivation of pyruvate kinase was used as an indicator of increases in the activity of cyclic-AMP-dependent protein kinase, A-kinase. [Ca2+]c was measured using the fluorescent probe indo-1. The decrease in activity of pyruvate kinase caused by an increase in [Ca2+]c alone, i.e. mediated by mechanisms not involving cyclic AMP and exemplified by the effect of vasopressin, was of minimal significance under the conditions of the enzyme assay. Studies of the effects of a wide range of glucagon concentrations indicate that any increase in [Ca2+]c caused by glucagon was always associated with a decrease in pyruvate kinase activity. A similar relationship was obtained if glucagon-receptor occupancy was circumvented by using the 8-bromo-derivative of cyclic AMP to activate the A-kinase. It was also found that the cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor isobutylmethylxanthine could potentiate the ability of glucagon to increase [Ca2+]c: no such potentiation was observed when vasopressin was used to raise [Ca2+]c. Together these data indicate that an increase in cyclic AMP concentration, sufficiently great to activate A-kinase, is a mechanism that mediates the glucagon-induced increase in [Ca2+]c."

        "abstract": "The present investigation was designed to determine the effects of feeding time on body weight gain in ovariectomized (OVX) rats pair-fed with sham operated control rats. In pair feeding, a test and a control rat were each fed the same amount of food. In the first experiment, OVX rats and controls were pair-fed at 1900, just before the dark phase of the light-dark cycle. Body weight gain was observed for 36 days. There was no significant difference in weight gain between the two groups. In the second experiment, when rats were pair-fed chow, starting from 1200, there was a significant increase in the body weight of the OVX group compared to the sham operated control group. Observation continued for 56 days. In the third experiment, the OVX group in the pair-fed condition and the sham control group were pair-fed at 1900 for 56 days and feeding was then switched to 0500 (just before the beginning of the light cycle) for 28 days. The body weight gain in the OVX pair-fed group was quite similar to that of the sham control group when feeding started at 1900, but a significant increase in body weight gain of the OVX group was observed after switching the starting time of feeding to 0500. In conclusion, the results suggest that the time of daily feeding may be important for body weight gain during the dynamic phase after ovariectomy."

As it was supposed that some improvement of the nutrition and physique since the end of the war should make the heart weight heavier, the value on 1,399 cases of medicolegal autopsy was measured and analyzed. The results revealed that the heart weight in the late of teens reaches the old value of grown-ups and the mean values of men (360 g) and women (300 g) earned by the present study are far more than those described in the former reports. It was presumed that periodic researches for the standard heart weight are indispensable in the consequence of the present study."

        "abstract": "The polyomavirus origin for DNA replication comprises at least two essential, but functionally distinct, cis-acting components. One of these, the origin core, is required only for DNA replication. It includes binding sites for large T antigen and the origin of bidirectional DNA replication. The other component is required for both transcription and DNA replication and is represented by two functionally redundant regions, alpha and beta, which are elements of the polyomavirus enhancer. Whereas either enhancer element will activate DNA replication, both enhancer elements are required to constitute a functional enhancer of transcription. To identify the sequences that make up each enhancer element, we have subjected them separately to in vitro mutagenesis and measured their capacity to activate replication in cis of the origin core in MOP-8 cells, which provide all trans-acting replicative functions including large T antigen. The results reveal that the beta enhancer element is composed of three subelements, two auxiliary subelements, and a core subelement. The core subelement independently activated DNA replication, albeit poorly. The auxiliary subelements, which were inactive on their own, acted synergistically with the core subelement to increase its activity. Interestingly, dimers of the beta core subelement functioned as well as the combination of a beta auxiliary subelement and a core subelement, suggesting that the subelements are functionally equivalent. The alpha enhancer element is organized similarly; it too comprises an auxiliary subelement and a core subelement. These results lead us to suggest that the polyomavirus enhancer comprises two levels of organization; two or more enhancer elements form an enhancer, and two or more subelements make up an enhancer element. The subelements share few sequences and serve as binding sites for distinct cellular factors. It appears, therefore, that a number of different cellular proteins function cooperatively to activate polyomavirus DNA replication by a common mechanism."

A mixture of three ER monoclonal antibodies--H222, D75 and D547--was used on sections of routinely processed and paraffin-embedded tissue blocks. Over 65% of the benign and malignant lesions showed some evidence of ER expression and significant staining was recorded by two observers in 28-31% of fibroadenomas, 18-28% of ductal epithelial hyperplasias, 30-40% of sclerosing adenosis cases, 38-45% of papillomas, 60% of in situ lobular carcinomas and 42-45% of intraduct carcinomas. Apocrine metaplastic cells and myoepithelial cells showed absent or only weak staining. Amongst intraduct carcinomas, less than 20% of comedo carcinomas and over 50% of cribriform, papillary and solid variants showed significant ER staining."

Responsiveness to PTH can once again be tested with teriparatide acetate, the newly available, biologically active 1-34 fragment of human PTH. The PTH infusion test can be used to confirm a preliminary diagnosis based on serum immunoreactive PTH values, to differentiate between type 1 and type 2 pseudohypoparathyroidism, or to detect a subtle abnormality of calcium metabolism in normocalcemic patients with features suggesting pseudohypoparathyroidism. Of several variables used to express changes in renal metabolism of cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) or phosphate, the 30-minute change in cAMP excretion per unit of glomerular filtration and the 60-minute percentage fall in the tubular maximum for phosphate reabsorption provide the best discrimination. Teriparatide has a low incidence of adverse reactions and provides an effective diagnostic tool."

Promotion of foci was commenced by feeding a choline-deficient diet (CD). A group of control rats was fed a choline-supplemented diet (CS). The ability of DEHP to suppress the emergence of GGT+ foci was evaluated by feeding additional groups of rats the CD diet containing either 0.1%, 0.5%, 1.0% or 2.0% DEHP. The CD diet promoted the number of GGT+ foci above levels in control livers. Inclusion of the plasticizer to the levels of 0.5%, 1.0% and 2.0% in the CD diet effectively inhibited the appearance of the foci. However, DEHP was unable to inhibit the promoting effect of the CD diet at a concentration of 0.1%. DEHP's ability to block development of GGT+ foci correlated with its ability to increase liver weight and to induce carnitine acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.7), a marker of peroxisome proliferation."

        "abstract": "A questionnaire comprised of a series of clinical vignettes illustrating potential difficulties in diagnosis, grading and treatment of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was completed by 65 bone marrow transplant physicians from 51 transplant centers worldwide. The concordance index (CI) for responses to each question was calculated using the formula CI = 2p-1, where p was the percentage agreement among respondents. Possible responses ranged from 0 (no agreement) to 1.00 (perfect agreement). Responses indicated moderate (CI = 0.55), high (CI = 0.88) and moderate (CI = 0.54) agreement among transplanters for diagnosis, grading and treatment of chronic GVHD, respectively. Disagreement was observed in (1) diagnosis of uncommon manifestations of chronic GVHD; (2) in interpretation of symptoms which occur less than 2 months after transplant; (3) in interpretation of persistent stable symptoms; and (4) in deciding whether to treat chronic GVHD limited to skin. The results point to potential problem areas in designing and interpreting clinical trials to prevent or treat chronic GVHD and highlight the need for improved diagnostic criteria."

        "abstract": "Rats were trained to discriminate 8.0 mg/kg of SKF 38393 (SKF) or 1.0 mg/kg of piribedil (PIR) from saline. Drugs were given 10 min before each session in a two-lever, food-reinforced (FR 30) drug discrimination paradigm. SKF (2.0-8.0 mg/kg i.p.) produced a dose-related increase in drug-appropriate responding in the SKF group but not in the PIR group. PIR (0.06-1.0 mg/kg i.p.) produced a dose-related increase in drug-appropriate responding in the PIR group but not in the SKF group. Apomorphine (0.03-0.5 mg/kg i.p. also produced a dose-related increase in PIR-appropriate responding, whereas dopamine (DA; 4.0-16 mg/kg i.p.), which does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier, did not. When pretreatment time was varied, SKF-appropriate responding was maximal when 8.0 mg/kg of SKF was injected 30 min before the session. PIR (1.0 mg/kg i.p.) occasioned maximal PIR-appropriate responding when injected 1 or 10 min before the session but did not when injected 30 or 60 min before the session. In rats trained to discriminate SKF (8.0 mg/kg) using a 30-min pretreatment time, the D1 antagonist SCH 23390 blocked the SKF discriminative stimulus (DS) but did not alter the PIR DS in PIR-trained rats. The D2 antagonist pimozide blocked the PIR DS but did not alter the SKF DS. Thus, the DS properties of D1 and D2 agonists are functionally distinct in rats and are antagonized by DA antagonists selective for D1 or D2 receptors, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

The development of the Adolescent Drug Abuse Diagnosis (ADAD), a 150-item instrument with a structured interview format, modeled after the Addiction Severity Index (ASI) (which is for adults), is described. The ADAD produces a broad-spectrum comprehensive evaluation of the client, the interviewer's ten-point severity ratings, and composite scores for each of nine life problem areas that are often relevant to the treatment needs of adolescent drug abuse clients. A series of validity and reliability tests are described. The characteristics of the standardization sample (N = 1,042), and the comparison of the characteristics of the three subsamples (outpatient, residential or non-hospital, and inpatient) are also presented."

Hypertrophic scar is an unacceptably enlarged scar, within the boundaries of the original wound; whereas keloid is an unacceptably enlarged scar infiltrating the surrounding tissue. Hypertrophic scar and keloid belong to the same category of diseases, characterized by increased collagen development. The treatments employed are compression, excision, corticosteroid injections and irradiation. New medical treatments affecting the collagen metabolism such as colchicin, beta-amino-proprionitrite (BAPN), D-penicillamine, cytostatics and prostaglandin-inhibitors have been introduced with promising results and fewer side effects."

The 7,12-DMBA metabolites were isolated by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and identified by their UV-visible absorption, mass, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectral characteristics. A comparison of the circular dichroism spectra of the K-region (5,6-position) dihydrodiol of both fungal strains with those of the 7,12-DMBA 5S,6S-dihydrodiol formed from 7,12-DMBA by rat liver microsomes indicated that the major enantiomer of the 7-hydroxymethyl-12-methylbenz[a]anthracene trans-5,6-dihydrodiol formed by both fungal strains had a 5R,6R absolute stereochemistry. Direct resolution of the fungal trans-5,6-dihydrodiols by chiral stationary-phase high-performance liquid chromatography indicated that the ratios of the R,R and S,S enantiomers were 88:12 and 77:23 for S. racemosum and C. elegans, respectively. These results indicate that the fungal metabolism of 7,12-DMBA at the K region (5,6-position) is highly stereoselective and different from that reported for mammalian enzyme systems."

Whilst the usual clinical picture is that of a large tumor deforming the breast with pseudo-inflammatory signs, sarcomas 1 to 3 cm in diameter were discovered and treated with good chances of recovery. The natural history of breast sarcomas is marked above all by the risk of hematogenic metastatic spread (30% of cases) whilst very few (5%) local recurrences are seen following surgical treatment by mastectomy. Emphasis is placed upon problems of histological diagnosis of the variety of sarcoma and the demonstration of histoprognostic factors which can be used to predict the outcome (mitotic activity, grading) showing evidence of good correlation in the series analyzed. The various characteristics of cystosarcoma phyllodes are described emphasizing the conditions surrounding its development, relations with benign phyllodes tumors. The particular severity of this sarcomatous form in the very young woman is mentioned. Prevention lies in the sufficiently extensive excision of the phyllodes tumor. Mesenchymatous sarcomas of the breast are also accompanied by a fairly favorable prognosis (5 year actuarial survival of 50 to 80% according to series). By contrast, two special and rare histological varieties, angiosarcoma and lymphosarcoma, are characterized by a much more gloomy prognosis and require different treatment including radiotherapy and chemotherapy."

An attempt has been made to reconcile differing observations, made by different groups of investigators, on the responses of aortic chemoreceptors of cats during normoxia, hypoxia and hypercapnia. 2. In cats anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbitone it was observed that during hypoxic stimulation of twelve chemoreceptors, an intravenous injection of about 20 mg sodium pentobarbitone produced hypotension which was accompanied by an initial fall in chemoreceptor activity instead of the expected increase that invariably occurred in all the receptors when hypotension was produced mechanically by distending a balloon in the right atrium (twenty-six during normoxia, eleven during hypoxia and eight during hypercapnia). 3. In twelve receptors a reflex fall in blood pressure produced by injecting 8-25 micrograms veratridine (Bezold-Jarisch reflex) yielded results qualitatively similar to those following injection of sodium pentobarbitone. 4. In sixteen out of twenty-five chemoreceptors it was observed that ventilating the cat with 5.6-6.7% CO2 produced either no or little increase in activity; in nine receptors there was a clear increase in activity, which fell initially or was abolished after injecting a single dose of 20 mg sodium pentobarbitone. 5. In all seven chemoreceptors tested in seven deeply anaesthetized cats it was found that a larger dose (about 50-60 mg) of sodium pentobarbitone had no direct depressant effect on aortic chemoreceptor activity. It followed that the initial depressant effect of the much smaller doses of sodium pentobarbitone observed during hypoxic and hypercapnic stimulation (see above) must be due to reduction in the sympathetic outflow to the aortic bodies. This conclusion was supported by the results following injections of veratridine. 6. By comparing the present results with those reported previously it was concluded that the variations in the responses of aortic chemoreceptors during hypoxia and hypercapnia reported by different investigators could be partly due to variations in the level of sympathetic activity prevailing under different experimental conditions."

Incubation of the colonic SW1116 cell line with an excess of MAb A7 induced modulation of the cell-surface antigen. When the line was assayed by ELISA, a change in cellular reactivity with MAb A7 was seen after 1 hr. After 24 hr, the cellular reactivity showed a 52% decrease in absorbance. Modulation was inhibited by 0.1% sodium azide and acetone fixation, suggesting that this is an energy-dependent phenomenon. The internalization of biotinylated MAb A7 was examined. Internalized biotinylated MAb A7 was detected in cells fixed before labelling with avidin-biotin peroxidase complex. It was observed that the amount of MAb A7 which remained associated with the cell surface had decreased since A7 was internalized."

        "abstract": "In an initial survey of 16 cases of Hodgkin's disease, tissues from one case of nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's disease, a recurrence with numerous Reed-Sternberg cells, demonstrated faint heavy- and light-chain immunoglobulin gene rearrangements. Analysis of seven additional similar cases with extremely numerous Reed-Sternberg cells revealed that six of these seven cases contained clonally rearranged heavy- or light-chain genes. In addition, the original biopsy specimen from the index case (obtained two years prior to the recurrence) had the same pattern of rearrangements of the immunoglobulin genes. In contrast, a germline configuration was observed for the beta T cell receptor gene in all cases. These cases of Hodgkin's disease were also investigated for the presence of Epstein-Barr viral (EBV) genomes by Southern and slot-blot DNA hybridization analysis. Tissues from four of the 21 case studied showed evidence of EBV DNA sequences. Uninvolved lymphoid tissue from two of the positive cases failed to demonstrate viral DNA. To assess clonality of the cells containing the EBV genomes, the tissues positive for EBV DNA were also hybridized with a restriction fragment probe for the terminal sequences of the EBV genome. By this analysis three of the four cases demonstrated a clonal population of EBV-infected cells."

        "abstract": "In perceiving shape-at-a-slant it is assumed that a sequence of operations is executed. The aim of these experiments was to determine the extent to which execution of these operations requires allocation of attention. Three hypotheses were considered: zero automaticity--that all of the operations require attention; partial automaticity--that the operations culminating in a representation of projective shape and slant-in-depth are automatic while the combinatorial operations culminating in a distally correlated shape require attention; full automaticity--that the entire sequence of operations is automatic, proceeding without allocation of attention. To decide among these hypotheses, subjects performed forced-choice shape recognition tests under two conditions: In the shape-directed condition subjects were motivated to process shape. In the numerosity-directed condition subjects were motivated to direct attention to discrimination of numerosity, thereby causing attention to be diverted from processing of shape. Examination of the pattern of choices on the recognition test showed results that conformed best to the hypothesis of partial automaticity."

The decomposition products identified were vinyl chloride, acetaldehyde, 2-chloroethanol, ethylene glycol and imidazole-bearing compounds of the type including oxazolidinone, ethylamine or urea moieties. Series A NI-CENUs, which contain a 2-hydroxypropyl unit, gave rise to the oxazolidinone intramolecularly compared with the series B agents which gave rise to the imidazole-ethylamine and ureas. The half-lives of the B series agents were comparable with those of 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)nitrosourea (BCNU), 2-cyclohexyl-1-(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (CCNU) and streptozotocin. The carbamoylation activity of the series B agents was approximately ten times that of series A compounds. This latter property may be related to the greater potency of series B than series A NI-CENUs against Mer+ HeLa-S3 cells via inhibition of relevant repair enzymes."

Numbers of children aged under 15 discharged from hospitals because of symptomatic infections of the urinary tract during 1978-84 were obtained from the database kept by the Finnish National Board of Health. Information on continuous treatment for recurrent urinary tract infections was obtained from records kept by the Social Insurance Institution on patients receiving free medicines. The yearly rate of attacks of symptomatic infections/1000 girls decreased significantly from 2.67 (95% confidence interval 2.52 to 2.82) in 1978 to 1.88 (1.76 to 2.01) in 1984. In boys the rate also decreased significantly, from 0.85 (0.77 to 0.93) in 1978 to 0.59 (0.52 to 0.66) in 1984. The period prevalence of free treatment/1000 girls decreased significantly from 7.80 (7.55 to 8.05) in 1978 to 5.30 (5.10 to 5.51) in 1984 but did not change significantly in boys. Although the findings may partly have been caused by changes in policies of admission to hospital, they suggest a decreasing trend in symptomatic urinary tract infections in childhood, which may be associated with changes in the care of infants."

        "abstract": "Maneb, an organomanganese fungicide, is largely used in agricultural regions for control of field crop pathologies. Despite its apparent low toxicity, there are reports showing that maneb has harmful effects on peripheral and central nervous systems. In this work the effects of acute administration of maneb were studied on some experimental animal models. Male adult mice were treated with several doses of maneb, IP, and submitted to gross behavioral observation (200-1000 mg/kg) and measurement of locomotor activity, barbiturate-induced sleeping time, isolation-induced aggressiveness, catatonia, climbing behavior and of rota-rod performance (30, 60 and 100 mg/kg). The results showed that maneb has an inhibitory effect on locomotor activity and aggressiveness and increases barbiturate-induced sleeping time and haloperidol-induced catatonia. However, maneb did not affect the apomorphine-induced climbing behavior of animals. These data indicate that maneb has a CNS depressant-like effect, and suggest, at least partially, the involvement of dopaminergic systems in the mediation of this effect."

        "abstract": "Dissolution kinetics of benzo(a)pyrene (B(a)P associated with urban air particulates were investigated in vitro and related to availability of the carcinogen in the isolated, perfused, and ventilated rat lung. Calculations of bioavailability and mean dissolution time in the lung produced results in concordance with experimental data. By convolution calculation, with in vitro desorption as input function and the disposition of B(a)P dosed intratracheally to the lung in an alveolar surfactant solution as reference, hypothetical areas under B(a)P buffer concentration vs. time curves (AUC) were calculated. AUC value for 1.5 micrograms of microcrystalline (MCr) B(a)P was 16 +/- 2 pmol/ml/min (N = 6), which was identical with the corresponding experimental value of 16 +/- 5 pmol/ml/min (N = 6), from lung perfusion experiments. For B(a)P adsorbed to urban air particulates (UAP-1), predicted and experimental AUC values did amount to 7 +/- 2 (N = 5) and 10 +/- 4 (N = 5) pmol/ml/min, respectively. Absolute bioavailability was calculated by deconvolution to 87% for B(a)P in alveolar surfactant. In vitro dissolution of B(a)P from urban air particulates (UAP-1 to -4) revealed a wide variation in desorption characteristics for different particulate samples. Dissolution parameters determined in vitro were positively related to mean absorption time and mean dissolution time in the lung, using three different preparations. The precision in predictions of availability of B(a)P from in vitro desorption rates, with MCr and UAP-1 representing the greatest differences observed, supports the hypothesis that desorption is the rate-limiting step during uptake of B(a)P in the lung.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

        "abstract": "Glucose concentration gradients across the liver and hepatic blood flow were measured to characterize the relationship of hepatic glucose uptake to hepatic glucose concentration for 240 min after administration of a large oral glucose load to fasted rats. Extraction of glucose occurred only transiently, from 20 to 80 min after glucose administration. The liver changed from net glucose output to net glucose removal only when the intracellular hepatic glucose concentration exceeded 12.5 mumol/ml water. Even when arteriovenous glucose concentrations gradients were compatible with net direct hepatic uptake of glucose, the hepatic glucose concentration always exceeded the inflow glucose concentration. These data indicate that direct glucose uptake occurred against a concentration gradient when the liver is considered as a whole. The hepatic intracellular-to-extracellular glucose concentration gradient changed very little, suggesting that this is not being regulated by glucose, insulin, or other effectors. The mechanism by which the hepatic glucose concentration and net hepatic glucose uptake versus output are coordinated is unknown. The rate of glycogen synthesis was linear for 120 min after administration of the glucose load. This occurred in the presence of direct uptake of glucose early in the time course and later in the presence of net glucose output by the liver. Net direct uptake of glucose by the liver could account for, at most, 37-55% of the glycogen formed. Fractional extraction of both lactate and alanine decreased after glucose was given, but net hepatic uptake of these metabolites could account for 33-49 and 7-10%, respectively, of the glycogen formed, depending on plasma versus blood water flow.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

        "abstract": "We describe a method, which is both specific and rapid, for the measurement of bupivacaine concentrations in plasma using high-performance liquid chromatography. Bupivacaine plasma concentrations, pharmacokinetics and protein binding in the postoperative period were investigated in seven patients (58-77 years old) following hip surgery. Postoperative analgesia was achieved by epidural bolus injections of 25 mg bupivacaine 0.25% every 6 h. Sufficient pain relief without side-effects was obtained. Total (maximum 1.13 micrograms/ml) as well as free (maximum 0.1 microgram/ml) bupivacaine plasma concentrations remained below toxic threshold levels and no cumulation occurred. Increased protein binding in the postoperative period is reported, emphasizing the importance of measuring the free fraction in addition to the total plasma concentration. The free fraction decreased from 5.4% preoperatively to 2.7% in the postoperative period (P less than 0.05). Changes in plasma protein binding of bupivacaine and changes in plasma levels of the acute phase reactant alpha-1-acid glycoprotein were correlated (r = 0.8, P less than 0.05). Difficulties in interpreting the elimination parameters following epidural administration are discussed, leading to the conclusion that the derivation of dosage regimens from kinetic parameters following epidural administration is not warranted."

        "abstract": "Malignant hemopathies and immune deficiencies are the main indications for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation in children. Among the former, the most common condition is acute lymphoblastic leukemia, in which a bone marrow transplant can be performed during the second or first complete remission (CR). Thirty to 50% and 60 to 75% of these grafts, respectively, are successful. The success rate is 50 to 70% among patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia grafted during the first complete remission, and among patients with chronic myeloid leukemia grafted during the chronic phase. Severe medullary aplasia and Fanconi disease are undoubtedly good indications for bone marrow transplantation, which has a 60 to 70% success rate. Severe combined immune deficiencies (SCID) and Wiskott-Aldrich disease are also good indications for HLA-identical bone marrow transplantation, which is successful in 60% of cases. Among the metabolic diseases, good results have been obtained only in Hurler disease and Gaucher disease. Questionable indications include thalassemia, Blackfan-Diamond disease, and chronic granulomatous disease. Results are disappointing in most metabolic diseases, as well as in non-HLA-identical transplantations in diseases other than SCID."

        "abstract": "The pharmacokinetics of acetaminophen was examined in rats after administration of a single dose of 200 mg kg-1 by the intra-arterial, intravenous, portal vein, and oral routes. Levels of acetaminophen and its two major metabolites, acetaminophen-glucuronide and acetaminophen-sulfate, were quantitated in plasma at various time points for about 5 h after drug administration. The relative contribution of the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and lung to the oral extraction ratio (first-pass effect after oral absorption) was determined. A mean oral extraction ratio of 0.49 was obtained. The mean relative extraction ratio of the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and lung were 0.52, 0.07, and 0, respectively, indicating a major contribution due to the gastrointestinal tract. This is in contrast to earlier studies which have indicated negligible contribution by the gastrointestinal tract to the oral first-pass effect when lower doses were utilized. These results suggest that the relative contribution of the gastrointestinal tract and liver to the oral first-pass effect of acetaminophen may be dose-dependent."

In techniques analogous to those employed with the Zn(II) metalloenzyme aspartate transcarbamoylase [Hunt, J. B., Neece, S. H., Schachman, H. K., & Ginsberg, A. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 14793-14803], we show that titration of core or holoRPase with 10 or 16 equiv, respectively, of the sulfhydryl reagent p-(hydroxymercuri)benzenesulfonate (PMPS) results in the facile release of 1 mol of Zn(II) [B-site Zn(II)] in a reaction totally reversible with the addition of excess thiol provided no metal chelator is present. If ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) is present, reversal of the PMPS-enzyme complex results in formation of a Zn1 RPase [A-site Zn(II)]. This enzyme retains full transcriptional activity relative to Zn2 RPase on both calf thymus (nonspecific) and T7 (sigma-dependent, specific) DNA templates. If the core enzyme-PMPS complex is incubated with a large excess of another metal such as Cd(II) followed by thiol treatment, a hybrid ZnACdB RPase is formed. Direct treatment of the enzyme with excess Cd(II) also gives rise to a hybrid ZnACdB RPase. Transcription by these enzymes is also comparable to that of the starting Zn2 enzyme. Isolation of in vivo synthesized Co2 RPase and Cd2 RPase and treatment of either enzyme with PMPS/EDTA results in formation of a CoA and CdA enzyme, respectively. Co(II)A and Cd(II)A enzymes show 123 and 76%, respectively, of the elongation rates on T7 DNA observed for the Zn(II) enzyme. Visible absorption spectroscopy of the Co2 enzyme exhibits four d-d transition bands positioned at 760 (epsilon = 800), 710 (epsilon = 900), 602 (epsilon = 1500), and 484 (epsilon = 4000) nm. In addition, two charge-transfer bands are found at 350 (epsilon = 9600) and 370 (epsilon = 9500) nm. Only the Co(II) ion bound at site A is associated with this unique set of intense d-d transitions. The positions and intensities of both the visible and charge-transfer bands of Co(II)A RPase approximate those shown by Co(II)-substituted metalloenzyme sites where the ligands are four S rather than mixed S,N or S,O sites."

        "abstract": "Cellular topography within the highly polarized surface epithelia can be used to identify the location of the stem cells. In some instances, this can be quite precise and allows the characteristics of stem cells to be studied. Our current knowledge of the stem cell population in murine epidermis and small intestinal crypts is reviewed. In the epidermis, the stem cells would appear to make up about 10% of the basal layer and are distributed towards the centre of the basal layer component of the epidermal proliferative unit. These cells have a long cell cycle and are probably the same cells that retain both tritiated thymidine and radioactively labelled carcinogens for long periods of time. This label retention permits the labelling of the putative stem cell compartment. Over recent years, there has been an accumulation of information indicating various types of heterogeneity within the basal layer, much of which can be interpreted in relation to cellular hierarchies. In the small intestine, cell positions can be fairly precisely identified and the stem cell zone identified. Complex modelling of a wide range of cell kinetic experiments suggests that each crypt contains between 4 and 16 steady state functional stem cells. Radiobiological experiments suggest that up to 32 cells may be capable of clonal regeneration. The repopulation of the clonogenic cell compartment has been determined and the doubling time measured to be 19.7 h. Such studies should throw further light on the behaviour of stem cells and identify the timing of periods of increased and decreased cell proliferation (activation and suppression of controls)."

        "abstract": "We have previously shown that a GTP derivative bearing p-azidoaniline at the gamma-phosphate group specifically labels the gamma-subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor eIF-2. In the present study a new GTP derivative carrying the photoreactive group at the ribose moiety of GTP was applied for affinity labeling of eIF-2 in different initiation complexes. Using this GTP analogue the beta-subunit of eIF-2 was found to be specifically labeled in all complexes investigated. It is concluded that GTP interacts with both the beta- and gamma-subunit of eIF-2: the guanosine moiety is in contact with the beta-subunit and the gamma-phosphate group with the gamma-subunit."

        "abstract": "To evaluate the medical aspects of the Health Hazard Evaluation (HHE) program of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), 170 lead-related HHE reports published through 1984 were examined. The percentages of HHEs conducting basic medical examination procedures justified by elevated environmental exposure to lead at worksites were as follows: blood or urine lead level testing, 57%; medical history taking, 55%; physical examinations, 23%; CBCs, 18%; and urinalysis, 7%. The HHE program has primarily focused on whether or not environmental worksite hazards are present at the time of the evaluation and not on ascertaining whether there is evidence of adverse health effects attributable to past worksite exposures. The program has not focused on minimizing adverse health effects when they exist or on providing a series of building blocks for health effects research. More clearly defined HHE program goals and a logic for deciding when and how medical examinations should be performed during HHEs need to be developed."

        "abstract": "Mechanisms involved in the control of pulmonary ventilation were studied in seven male subjects following 6 min of exercise on a cycle ergometer at 98w. Circulation to the legs was occluded by thigh cuffs (27 kPa) during the last 15 s of exercise and the subsequent 4 min of recovery. Respiratory gas exchange and the tidal partial pressures of O2 and CO2 were measured breath-by-breath. The results were compared to control studies without occlusion. There was a significant increase in both systolic and diastolic blood pressures during occluded recovery. Following occlusion systolic pressure remained elevated while diastolic pressure returned to control values. Occlusion during recovery caused hyperventilation during the first 1.5 min after exercise as evidenced by significantly higher VE/VCO2, VE/VO2, PETO2, and lower PETCO2. Following the release of the cuffs PETCO2, VE, VCO2, VO2, and heart rate all increased significantly above control values, while PETO2 decreased. PETCO2 rose abruptly 14.5 +/- 0.9 s after the release of the cuffs. Marked increases in VE and heart rate were seen, and occurred 30.8 +/- 1.5 s and 12.8 +/- 1.3 s, respectively, after cuff release. The 16.3 +/- 1.4 s lag between the increase in PETCO2 and VE after occlusion suggests that the ventilatory response to a sudden load of hypercapnic blood is not mediated by a pulmonary chemoreceptor. Other receptors, probably the peripheral chemoreceptors, appear to be responsible for hypercapnic hyperventilation."

Information regarding symptom severity both on and off medication was gathered along with an analysis of different medications in use, and patient ratings of effectiveness of those medications. Patients also rated their own mental health. Results indicated that approximately 60% of TS patients take some form of medication for relief from their symptoms. Of these, over 80% reported that symptoms are less severe when medicated. The most commonly prescribed medications in order of popularity are haloperidol, pimozide, clonidine and benztropine mesylate (Cogentin). Patient ratings of effectiveness of these medications places haloperidol first, pimozide second and clonidine third although all were found to be \"somewhat\" to \"very\" effective. Of those TS patients on medications, 50% rated their own mental health as good to excellent and 50% rated it as fair to poor."

        "abstract": "A heat-stable factor of low molecular weight that increases the binding of [3H]MK-801 to rat brain membranes in the presence of maximally effective concentrations of L-glutamate and glycine was purified from bovine brain by reverse phase and ion-exchange high pressure liquid chromatography. The stimulatory activity was due to the presence of spermidine in the active fractions. Polyamines including spermine and spermidine are found in high concentrations in mammalian tissue. These compounds increase the affinity of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors for [3H]MK-801 when assays are carried out in the presence of 100 microM L-glutamate and 100 microM glycine. At concentrations of 1 to 300 microM, a number of di- and triamines, including NH2(CH2)3NH2, NH2(CH2)3NH(CH2)2NH2, and NH2(CH2)3NH(CH2)3NH2, have partial or full agonist-like activity similar to that of spermidine. Other polyamines, including putrescine, cadaverine, NH2(CH2)2NH(CH2)2NH2, and CH3NH(CH2)3NHCH3, at concentrations of 1 to 100 microM, inhibited the binding of [3H]MK-801 in the presence of spermine, L-glutamate, and glycine but not in the presence of only L-glutamate and glycine. It is concluded that these compounds are selective antagonists of the effects of spermine at the NMDA receptor. These results suggest that there may be a polyamine recognition site on the NMDA receptor complex."

        "abstract": "The potential impact of COBRA is staggering and must be confronted. The ultimate scope and effects will take shape quickly. Federal regulations will provide some of the rules, but the most important definitions under the law will develop in court. Because of a lack of understanding hospitals may not have been in compliance with COBRA's strict terms since August 1986 and may only become educated on COBRA through the legal process. Currently, one COBRA lawsuit has been filed in the Chicago court system, and at least one physician group in California has paid a $25,000 fine for COBRA violations. Litigation in the initial phase of COBRA is likely as most hospitals continue to be unaware of the implications of COBRA legislation. EDs, emergency medical services programs, and interhospital transport programs must begin an immediate effort to examine and develop policies to comply with COBRA. Without an effective educational, compliance, and risk management effort, any emergency medical services program or hospital may become a defendant under COBRA legislation. Delays in understanding and implementing the requirements of COBRA may adversely affect the health care system rather than improve it."

        "abstract": "Denial, acting on both the inner and external world, relies on further defence mechanisms in the form of object manipulations aimed at changing reality to make it fit the denying person's inner needs. If the object's ego is not strong enough to resist these manipulations, it is pressured into a submissive relationship. By means of seduction or its opposite, intimidation and the use of threats, the object is made to believe the content of the denying persons's inner or external world. The result is a mutually intrusive and reciprocal relationship in which the roles of victim and perpetrator alternate. This is the case when children are not allowed to acquire their own experiences during the process of transition from symbiosis to separation. Constant exposure to irritation leads to a regression of the ego, to the illusion that everything is possible in the 'we'. Object relations in adult life are then based on a parasitic need for the object in order to realize inner goals. In analysis this is manifested as symbiotic omnipotence, posing a 'serious stumbling block' to the analytic process, which may take the form of an 'as-if' analysis."

        "abstract": "This study was undertaken to evaluate angiotensin converting enzyme activity in patients with liver disease, and to explore its relationship to thyroid function in patients with liver disease. Serum angiotensin converting enzyme activity and thyroid hormone levels, determined in 79 patients with intrahepatic-type liver disease and 18 patients with extrahepatic biliary obstruction, were compared with values in 129 euthyroid controls. Serum angiotensin converting enzyme activity was higher in intrahepatic disease than in extrahepatic obstruction, but statistically significant only for acute intrahepatic disease. In the patients studied, high serum angiotensin converting enzyme activity (22 units/ml or more) virtually excluded extrahepatic biliary obstruction, with a negative predictive value of 94 percent. Low serum angiotensin converting enzyme activity had a positive predictive value for extrahepatic obstruction of only 67 percent. Increased angiotensin converting enzyme activity could not be explained as a function of enhanced thyroid activity. Serum angiotensin converting enzyme activity may be useful in separating patients with intrahepatic liver disease from those with extrahepatic obstruction."

        "abstract": "The effects of alpha adrenoceptor stimulation with noradrenaline were investigated in rat ventricular myocytes after blockade of beta receptors with propranolol (1 microM). At room temperature and low stimulation frequency (0.5 Hz), noradrenaline evoked a phentolamine-sensitive increase in contraction amplitude by 22%. The action potentials of myocytes were prolonged. When the sodium current was inactivated by depolarization in whole-cell voltage clamp experiments, noradrenaline caused a small, but highly variable increase in net inward current and shifted the current-voltage relation between -30 and -5 mV to the hyperpolarizing direction. These effects were absent when K+ currents were inhibited by Cs+ substitution. After inhibition of the Ca++ current with Cd++ (0.1 mM), noradrenaline decreased the peak transient outward current; it reduced the steady-state outward current in a concentration-dependent manner (pD2 value, 6.9), but had no effect on the amplitude of the transient component of outward current. Noradrenaline reduced holding current at -40 mV. The inward branch of the inward rectifier was not affected. The noradrenaline-induced changes in membrane currents were significantly smaller in the presence of phentolamine (10 microM). They are therefore considered to be mediated by alpha adrenoceptor stimulation. The reduction in outward currents can explain the prolongation in action potential duration which could contribute to the increase in contractility."

        "abstract": "Two-limb coordination of homologous and non-homologous effectors was examined during isofrequency (1:1) and multifrequency (2:1) conditions. The coordination patterns involved flexion and extension movements in the sagittal plane and were performed under unloaded and single-limb (right arm) loaded conditions. Previous studies suggested that the lower degree of 1:1 synchronization observed during nonhomologous as compared to homologous coordination results from natural differences in biophysical (inertial) properties. Elaborating on this idea, adding weight to the right arm was hypothesized to modulate its inertial characteristics, rendering homologous limbs more dissimilar and nonhomologous limbs more similar by enhancing and decreasing their inertial differences, respectively. Therefore, the observations made during unloaded conditions were predicted to be completely reversed during loaded conditions. Findings revealed that during 1:1 coordination (experiment 1) single-limb loading resulted in a decreased relative phase stability, whereas relative phase accuracy depended upon the limb combination. In particular, phase-locking was more accurately maintained for loaded homologous than for nonhomologous limbs, whereas loading the nonhomologous limbs resulted in a deterioration of the quality of synchronization. These findings suggest that there is an additional explanation of differential coordination capabilities among limb combinations. It is hypothesized that the neural networks subserving the control centers of the homologous limbs are more tightly connected than those of the nonhomologous effectors, allowing 1:1 synchronization to be more successfully preserved in the face of (load) perturbations. During 2:1 coordination (experiment 2), the loading procedure disturbed the coordination dynamics across all limb combinations. That no differential effect of loading on effector combination was observed is possibly a result of the fact that only an initial level of practice was studied in which optimal relative phase dynamics are still being explored for both homologous and nonhomologous limbs."

        "abstract": "There is disagreement concerning the use of the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (in place of left atrial pressure) in assessing the presence and severity of mitral valve disease. This study was done to assess the accuracy and reliability of an oximetrically confirmed pulmonary capillary wedge pressure in measuring the transvalvular pressure gradient and valve area in patients with mitral stenosis. In 10 patients with mitral stenosis (1 man and 9 women; mean age +/- SD 47 +/- 7 years), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was measured through an 8F Goodale-Lubin catheter with its wedge position confirmed by oximetry (oxygen saturation greater than or equal to 95%). In addition, a transseptal left atrial pressure was measured through a Brockenbrough catheter and left ventricular pressure was measured through a pigtail catheter. The mean and phasic left atrial and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures were similar (mean left atrial pressure 18 +/- 6 mm Hg; mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 18 +/- 8 mm Hg; p = NS). When the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was used without adjustment for time delay, the transvalvular pressure gradient (9.8 +/- 3.3 mm Hg) and valve area (1.5 +/- 0.5 cm2) were significantly different (p less than 0.05) from the values obtained with use of left atrial pressure (7.2 +/- 2.9 mm Hg and 1.7 +/- 0.6 cm2, respectively). In contrast, when the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was adjusted for the time delay through the pulmonary vasculature, the difference in gradients averaged only 1.7 mm Hg and the mitral valve areas were similar.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

        "abstract": "The Saccharomyces cerevisiae GPA1 gene encodes a protein highly homologous to the alpha subunit of mammalian G proteins and is essential for haploid cell growth. We have selected 77 mutants able to suppress the lethality resulting from disruption of GPA1 (gpa1::HIS3). Two strains bearing either of two recessive mutations, sgp1 and sgp2, in combination with the disruption mutation, showed a cell type nonspecific sterile phenotype, yet expressed the major alpha-factor gene (MF alpha 1) as judged by the ability to express a MF alpha 1-lacZ fusion gene. The sgp1 mutation was closely linked to gpa1::HIS3 and probably occurred at the GPA1 locus. The sgp2 mutation was not linked to GPA1 and was different from the previously identified cell type nonspecific sterile mutations (ste4, ste5, ste7, ste11 and ste12). sgp2 GPA1 cells showed a fertile phenotype, indicating that the mating defect caused by sgp2 is associated with the loss of GPA1 function. While expression of a FUS1-lacZ fusion gene was induced in wild-type cells by the addition of alpha-factor, mutants bearing sgp1 or sgp2 as well as gpa1::HIS3 constitutively expressed FUS1-lacZ. These observations suggest that GPA1 (SGP1) and SGP2 are involved in mating factor-mediated signal transduction, which causes both cell cycle arrest in the late G1 phase and induction of genes necessary for mating such as FUS1."

The protein encoded by the cDNA was analyzed in relation to 13 LDH proteins from a variety of taxa. One of the deductions from this analysis is that LDH-B proteins have residues in the active site that are unique and that may be important in determining the biochemistry of the heart-type isozyme. Phylogenetic analysis of the LDH sequences indicates that the branch lengths are greater in lower vertebrates, suggesting that the amino acid replacement rates vary depending on the evolutionary constraints within each taxon. Furthermore, the analysis suggests that LDH-C arose prior to the divergence of the LDH-A and LDH-B isozymes and thus that it is probably ancestral to these isozymes."

Since the response to treatment of human carcinomas growing in nude mice is deemed to be a good indicator of the potential clinical behavior of these tumors, we studied the influence of this stable isotope of hydrogen on the growth of xenotransplanted human carcinomas of various histologic types, grades, and primary sites. Seven-week-old Balb/c-nu/nu mice were inoculated subcutaneously, either with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas or with carcinomas of the large intestine. After tumor inoculation, the mice were given drinking water containing 30 atom% D2O. Heavy water effectively retarded the growth of the human carcinomas. At the end of the experiment, the weight of the tumors was reduced to values ranging from 22% to 65% of the control values. The reproducible antiproliferative effect was more conspicuous in poorly differentiated carcinomas than in moderately well-differentiated variants. Since animals in both groups, kept under identical conditions, drank the same amount of water and had similar body weights, the difference in tumor growth can be attributed to the moderate deuteration of the hosts."

        "abstract": "Serum neuron-specific enolase (NSE) levels were studied in 105 patients with malignant neoplasms (lung cancer 38, others 67), 13 patients with various benign diseases and 7 healthy adults. The mean serum NSE level in adult control subjects was 7.4 +/- 0.8 ng/ml, and cut off level was decided 10 ng/ml. Serum NSE levels were elevated in 14/38 (37%) of patients with lung cancer and in 14/67 (21%) of patients with the other malignant neoplasms. In patients with benign diseases, serum NSE level was elevated only in one patient with pituitary adenoma. In 7 patients with small cell lung cancer, the positive rate was higher (86%) than in those with non-small cell lung cancer (26%), and serum NSE levels were higher than 25 ng/ml except one case. There was no correlation between serum NSE and CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen) levels in patients with small cell lung cancer, also in patients with lung cancer. The measurement of serum NSE level seemed to be useful for diagnosis in patients with small cell lung cancer."

        "abstract": "E. coli contains a soluble proteolytic pathway which can recognize and degrade oxidatively denatured proteins and protein fragments, and which may act as a \"secondary antioxidant defense.\" We now provide evidence that this proteolytic pathway is distinct from the previously described ATP-dependent, and protease \"La\"-dependent, pathway which may degrade other abnormal proteins. Cells (K12) which were depleted of ATP, by arsenate treatment or anaerobic incubation (after growth on succinate), exhibited proteolytic responses to oxidative stress which were indistinguishable from those observed in cells with normal ATP levels. Furthermore, the proteolytic responses to oxidative damage by menadione or H2O2 were almost identical in the isogenic strains RM312 (a K12 derivative) and RM1385 (a lon deletion mutant of RM312). Since the lon (or capR) gene codes for the ATP-dependent protease \"La,\" these results indicate that neither ATP nor protease \"La\" are required for the degradation of oxidatively denatured proteins. We next prepared cell-free extracts of K12, RM312, and RM1385 and tested the activity of their soluble proteases against proteins (albumin, hemoglobin, superoxide dismutase, catalase) which had been oxidatively denatured (in vitro) by exposure to .OH, .OH + O2- (+O2), H2O2, or ascorbate plus iron. The breakdown of oxidatively denatured proteins was several-fold higher than that of untreated proteins in extracts from all three strains, and ATP did not stimulate degradation. Incubation of extracts at 45 degrees C, which inactivates protease \"La,\" actually stimulated the degradation of oxidatively denatured proteins. Although Ca2+ had little effect on proteolysis, serine reagents, transition metal chelators, and hemin effectively inhibited the degradation of oxidatively denatured proteins in both intact cells and cell-free extracts. Degradation of oxidatively denatured proteins in cell-free extracts was maximal at pH 7.8, and was unaffected by dialysis of the extracts against membranes with molecular weight cutoffs as high as 50,000. Our results indicate the presence of a neutral, ATP- and calcium- independent proteolytic pathway in the E. coli cytosol, which contains serine- and metallo- proteases (with molecular weights greater than 50,000), and which preferentially degrades oxidatively denatured proteins."

        "abstract": "Amphotericin B therapy is hampered by numerous adverse effects but remains the treatment of choice for disseminated fungal infections. A new form of amphotericin B delivery, which utilizes liposome vesicles, is currently under investigation. Preliminary evidence suggests that liposome-encapsulated amphotericin B has a wider therapeutic index than free amphotericin B and allows for the use of larger total doses. The mechanism of reduced toxicity and enhanced activity may be associated with a liposome donor effect, an erythrocyte protective effect, and a liposome-targeting ability. Liposome-encapsulated amphotericin B tends to be entrapped or taken up by organs rich in reticuloendothelial cells--a particular advantage since disseminated fungal infections localize in these areas. This liposome-encapsulated preparation appears to represent a promising new form of antifungal therapy that may reduce the dose-limiting toxicities of amphotericin B and improve treatment response."

        "abstract": "Despite the persistence of phencyclidine (PCP) abuse as a public health problem in many urban areas of the United States, there are no published data on outpatient treatment outcome. We studied 37 unselected male PCP abusers (mean age 32 years, 73% Black, 19% married, 68% unemployed) who attended at least one outpatient treatment session at the Brentwood Division, West Los Angeles VA Medical Center. Subjects had smoked PCP for an average of 7 years, with 84% using it at least weekly (38% daily) and 76% using other drugs (alcohol, marijuana, or cocaine). All subjects reported psychological dependence on PCP (i.e., liking PCP use and difficulty stopping despite adverse consequences), while none reported a physiological withdrawal syndrome when stopping PCP use. Subjects stayed in treatment an average of 21 weeks (range 1-155 weeks), attending an average of 68% of the group meetings. PCP was detected in weekly urine samples 78% of the time, with verbal self-report of recent PCP use occurring before 29% of the group meetings. Four subjects (11%) achieved at least 1 year of abstinence, 10 (30%) transferred to residential treatment or a community recovery home, 16 (48%) dropped out of treatment, and two (6%) were jailed. Treatment outcome was not significantly associated with subject characteristics. Age was the only subject characteristic that significantly predicted length of stay (r = .40)."

        "abstract": "The expression of endogenous retroviral sequences and of three cellular oncogenes was examined in three hepatocellular adenomas and in four carcinomas induced in male C57BL/6JDp X C3Hf/Dp F1 (hereafter called B6C3F1) mice by a single dose of nitrosodiethylamine, in five carcinomas that arose spontaneously in male C3Hf mice, and in the livers of normal age-matched control mice. In all of these adenomas and carcinomas, there was increased expression of Moloney murine leukemia virus- and intracisternal A particle-related sequences. The retrovirus-like VL30 sequence was expressed at significant levels in the normal liver of these mice and increased expression of this sequence was found in only 4 of the 12 tumors examined. Expression of endogenous mouse mammary tumor virus-related sequences was not detected in the normal livers or in any of the liver tumors. With respect to cellular oncogenes, increased expression of c-myc was seen in all of the B6C3F1 tumors. Two of five normal liver samples and all of the tumors of the C3Hf mice displayed significant expression of c-myc. There was a slight increase in expression of c-Ha-ras in some of the tumors. Increased expression of c-fos was found in only 1 of the 12 tumors. Taken together, these studies indicate that both carcinogen-induced and spontaneous liver tumor formation in mice is associated with abnormalities in the expression of endogenous retrovirus-related DNA sequences and also specific cellular oncogenes."

        "abstract": "The two renin genes of the mouse (Ren1 and Ren2) are expressed at different levels in the submaxillary gland (SMG). In contrast to mice, there is no detectable renin gene expression in the rat SMG. To determine the molecular basis for these different levels of renin expression, we have compared the 5'-flanking regions of the rat and mouse genes. The sequence of mouse, but not rat, genes reveals the presence in Ren1 and Ren2 of a large insertion, probably a new class of transposable elements. A second, apparently unrelated shorter insertion is present only in Ren2. Otherwise, the mouse and rat 5'-flanking sequences are well conserved and resemble the corresponding region of the human Ren gene, indicating that the insertions occurred after the separation of the rat and mouse species but before the duplication of the mouse Ren gene. We suggest that these structural differences may have a role in the differential expression of the Ren genes in mice and other animals."

We found that the main prognostic factors predicting an improved survival (measured with the LRR) are: chemotherapy including cisplatin as initial treatment, a residual tumour mass of less than 2 cm prior to therapy, FIGO stage II/III and a good performance status. In a multivariate model, the use of cisplatin and the residual tumour were found to be the only factors of prognostic relevance. No relation between median survival and the overall clinical response rate of all patients entered in the denominator, could be demonstrated. Undifferentiated tumours and patients treated with cisplatin regimens had higher response rates to treatment but younger patients and those with endometrioid histology were less likely to respond. A surgical complete remission was encountered more frequently among studies that included a high number of patients with small tumour masses prior to treatment. Trials using cisplatin included more patients with small tumour nodules in their patient material compared to studies not using this drug. The data illustrate the danger of comparing studies with each other. In the trials with a high percentage of patients with small tumour residuals in the study population more toxic deaths were seen. This probably reflects the fact that they had received more intensive treatment. The LRR correlated strongly with the median survival, response and the percentage of surgical complete remissions. We concluded that the introduction of the LRR can be a meaningful addition to the evaluation of the influence of prognostic factors on overall survival."

        "abstract": "The distribution, origin and fine structure of substance P-like immunoreactive (SPI) nerve terminals in the facial nucleus of the rat were investigated by means of immunocytochemistry. SPI-terminals were concentrated in the intermediate and dorsal subnuclei of the facial nucleus. Hemi-transection of the brainstem just rostral to the facial nucleus or at the most caudal level of the medulla oblongata did not cause any change of SPI-terminals in the facial nucleus. Electrical destruction of the various parts of the medulla oblongata clearly demonstrated that SPI-terminals in the intermediate subnucleus were supplied contralaterally from the SPI-neurons in the dorsomedial part of the medullary reticular formation. Most of the SPI-terminals (85%) in the intermediate subnucleus of the facial nucleus were observed to make asymmetric synaptic contacts with large dendrites (mean diameter; 1.26 micron). It was supposed that the contact sites are located on proximal parts of the dendrite. A few SPI-terminals (6%) formed axo-somatic contacts with large perikarya filled with numerous cytoplasmic organelles."

        "article_title": "Signalling proteins in enterobacterial AmpC beta-lactamase regulation.",
        "abstract": "The cloned Citrobacter freundii ampC beta-lactamase is inducible in the presence of its regulatory gene ampR in Escherichia coli (Lindberg et al., 1985). The basal level of expression and inducibility are affected by two E. coli proteins encoded by the closely linked ampD and ampE genes. Deletion of both genes led to constitutive ampR-dependent overproduction of beta-lactamase, whereas an out-of-frame deletion in AmpD caused the basal expression to increase two-fold. This ampD1 mutant was inducible at lower beta-lactam concentrations than the wild type. An IS1 insertion in ampD was polar on ampE expression and increased basal beta-lactamase expression 30-fold while mediating a semi-constitutive phenotype. AmpE expressed from a recombinant plasmid in an ampD-ampE deletion mutant reduced basal beta-lactamase expression to wild-type levels but did not markedly reduce beta-lactam resistance since the cells became hyperinducible. In the absence of AmpD, increasing levels of AmpE therefore decrease the basal expression of AmpC beta-lactamase in an AmpR-dependent manner. AmpD modulated the response exerted on beta-lactamase expression by AmpE. The ampD gene encodes a 20.5kD cytoplasmic protein while the 32.1kD ampE gene product is an integral membrane protein with a likely ATP-binding site between the second and third putative transmembrane region. Since neither AmpD nor AmpE are needed for beta-lactam induction and since these proteins could not be covalently labelled by benzylpenicillin, they are not thought to act as beta-lactam-binding sensory transducers. Instead it is suggested that AmpD and AmpE sense the effect of beta-lactam action on peptidoglycan biosynthesis and relay this signal to AmpR."

        "abstract": "Between July 1978 and January 1988, 111 of 210 pancreas transplants were in nonuremic, nonkidney (NUNK) recipients in whom complications of diabetes were judged more serious than the potential side effects of antirejection therapy. In all NUNK cases, the 1-year patient survival rate (PSR) and graft survival rate (GSR) were 90% and 39%. Since November 1984, 1-year PSR and GSR for 62 NUNK recipients of pancreas transplants alone (PTA) were 93% and 48%, compared to 89% and 37% for 28 pancreas transplants after (PAK) and 89% and 73% for 20 simultaneous (SPK) with a kidney transplant. The 1-year GSR for 1984-88 technically successful (TS) PTA cases (n = 47) was 63%, versus 75% for PAK (n = 13) and 86% for SPK (n = 17) cases. The 1-year GSRs, by technique and source for 1984-88 PTA cases, were 58% for bladder-drained cadaver (n = 30), 51% for enteric-drained related (n = 32), and 29% for enteric-drained cadaver (n = 17) donor transplants, and 75% (n = 24), 77% (n = 16), and 38% (n = 13) for the corresponding TS cases. Of NUNK recipients, 35 have had grafts function for more than 1 year and all but 3 were treated with cyclosporine (CsA). In the CsA-treated recipients, serum creatinine increased and creatinine clearances decreased by a magnitude of 40% during the first 6 months but thereafter remained stable in all but 2 patients. In the patients with functioning grafts studied at 1 year, retinopathy remained stable in 59% and progressed in 41% of the eyes (n = 39). Motor nerve conduction velocities were significantly increased and muscle action potentials remained stable in 24 patients with functioning grafts studied at 1 year, while in 14 patients in whom transplants failed there was a significant decrease in evoked muscle action potentials. A sustained euglycemic, insulin-independent state can be established in nonuremic, nonkidney diabetic recipients of pancreas transplants alone, with a beneficial effect on neuropathy, lack of an immediate benefit on advanced retinopathy, and an effect on nephropathy compounded by the influence of CsA on renal function."

        "abstract": "The effects of human recombinant growth hormone (rhGH) on regenerating skeletal muscle after ischaemic necrosis and on denervated skeletal muscle were studied in normal adult rats. One group of rats was treated with 4 IE rhGH daily by subcutaneous injections, while control rats were injected with saline. The treatment with rhGH resulted in increased levels of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) in serum. Ischaemic necrosis was achieved in the extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle by cutting the supplying vessels and nerve fascicles at the entrance into the muscle. The wet weight and DNA: protein ration in the regenerating muscle were determined 2 and 4 weeks after the operation. The weight of the regenerating muscles in the rats treated with rhGH during the period of study was larger than in the control rats, while the DNA:protein ratio did not differ significantly between the groups. Denervation of the EDL and soleus muscles followed by subsequent reinnervation was obtained by freezing the sciatic nerve with a forceps chilled in liquid nitrogen. Rats treated with rhGH during the period of denervation and reinnervation, i.e. during the 4 weeks after the freezing of the sciatic nerve, revealed increased weight of both the reinnervated and normal muscles compared to corresponding muscles of control rats. Denervation of the EDL and soleus muscles without subsequent reinnervation was achieved by cutting the sciatic nerve at the level of the thigh. Four weeks after denervation the muscles showed atrophy, mainly affecting type 2 fibres in the EDL muscle and both type 1 and type 2 fibres in the soleus muscle."

We compared 2 long-term residential groups with high and low exposure to malaria. The seropositive rate to the peptides was significantly higher with increased exposure. There was no significant difference in response rates to the Pf155/RESA. This may indicate the level of persistent T cell memory in previously primed donors. The seropositive rates to 3 Pf155/RESA peptides and the rates measured by either 3H-thymidine incorporation or IFN-gamma release after stimulation with Pf155/RESA and the peptides were all lower in parasite positive individuals. Even low grade, asymptomatic parasitemia can impair the T cell response in vitro. The lower antibody response in parasite positive subjects may be explained by either antibody consumption or lower protection against malaria parasitemia in subjects with low concentrations of antibodies against the Pf155/RESA antigen."

        "abstract": "Three pyridazinyl-gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) derivatives, SR 95103, SR 42641 and SR 95531, have previously been shown to be specific, competitive and reversible GABAA antagonists. For all three compounds selectivity was claimed mainly on the basis of biochemical results. However the absence of an interaction with the binding site for strychnine does not preclude an interaction with the glycine receptor. Therefore the interaction between these compounds and GABA- and glycine-elicited responses in the rat cuneate nucleus was examined in vivo by microiontophoretic techniques using extracellular recordings. Preliminary experiments in the somesthetic cortex of the rat (18 cells) confirmed that SR 95103 (100 mM; 0-100 nA) blocked GABA-evoked responses. In the cuneate nucleus SR 95103 (100 mM), SR 42641 (5 mM), SR 95531 (5 mM) and bicuculline methochloride (BMC; 5 mM) blocked GABA-elicited responses in a dose-dependent, competitive and reversible fashion for ejection currents up to 100 nA. The compound SR 95103 appeared to be less potent than bicuculline and also antagonized glycine-induced responses. Both SR 42641 and SR 95531 appeared to be equipotent to bicuculline and selective for the GABA receptor. Based on these results, it is postulated that SR 42641 and SR 95531 are potent and reversible GABAA antagonists and could be useful tools to further characterize the GABA receptor."

Six additional findings (minor criteria) were significantly more common in atypical spondyloarthritis (SA): (1) disease onset after the age of 10 years; (2) male sex; (3) involvement of the lower extremities; (4) acute iridocyclitis or conjunctivitis; (5) arthritis of the hip joints; (6) manifestation following a history of enteritis. In the presence of 4 major criteria or 3 major and 3 minor criteria, the diagnosis of an atypical SA was established with a sensitivity of 84.6%, a specificity of 100%, and an efficiency of 96.1%."

The immunoblots were stained with rabbit homologous and heterologous antibodies. In general, the higher the mol. wt the protein the higher the immunogenicity although two proteins with mol. wts of 23,000 and 25,000 from O. hannah venom are extraordinarily immunogenic. Cross reacting and species specific venom proteins were readily identified by the immunoblot techniques. Only a small number of venom proteins were cross-reactive among the snake species tested while the remaining appeared to be species specific."

Mean postprandial lipaemia was similar after meals containing 100 ml dairy cream (containing 40 g fat) and after meals containing 100 ml dairy cream and 23 g protein (in the form of casein). The rate of disappearance of an intravenous bolus of Intralipid was similar before and after the ingestion of 23 g casein. These findings indicate that dietary protein does not significantly affect postprandial lipaemia or chylomicron-triglyceride clearance."

The model became the basis for the design of a new study plan in addition to providing the strategy for recruitment of the faculty for the new School of Public Health of the San Diego State University in San Diego, California. They give an account of the circumstances leading up to the establishment of this institution, the gradual consolidation of the different health science programs into a single school with graduate studies leading to masters degrees in six main fields: environmental health, occupational health, epidemiology, maternal and child health, health services administration, and health development. The authors see the beginning of a redefinition of the function of the basic sciences represented in environmental health in the light of new knowledge and technology, and believe that all fields of knowledge (microbiology, parasitology and health development) will contribute as a unified whole to increase the capacity of public health to place both biological and environmental health problems in a context that society can control."

Remarkably, the abuse of alcohol and particularly of drugs had frequently started at higher age. Situations of loss, loneliness, and isolation as well as mental and physical disease played a precipitation part. In the majority of patients the course of the dependence was severe. Prophylactic and diagnostic problems will be discussed and the necessity of improved therapeutic means will be pointed out. The avoidance of iatrogenically induced drug dependence appears to be particularly important."

        "abstract": "A case is reported, in which a patient 54 years old, was admitted after a SAH. The CT Scan (D1) demonstrated blood in the peri-peduncular cisterns. A first angiogram through femoral route was performed at D1. There was no vascular malformation on both carotid territories. An arterial ectasia was demonstrated on the basilar artery, arising at the origin of the left superior cerebellar artery. The left posterior cerebral artery was supplied only by the left carotid artery through a dilated posterior communicating artery. A second left vertebral angiogram was performed at D8, to make sure whether this ectasia was an aneurysm or a non aneurysmal dysplasia, but failed to provide certainty. The patient was operated upon at D17, with the diagnosis of possible aneurysm at the origin of the left superior cerebellar artery. Through a pterional route the posterior communicating artery was approached, no blood was found in the area of the upper basilar artery; there was an abnormal posterior circle of Willis, the superior cerebellar artery arising with a common trunk from the upper basilar artery; distal to this common trunk, the P1 segment was normal on the first three fourths of its course; the last fourth of the P1 segment was highly narrowed, the outer diameter of the narrowed P1 segment was approximately one third of the normal P1 segment, and was located at the junction with the complex posterior communicating artery-P2 segment. This narrowed part of the P1 segment showed evidence of an atheromatous plaque on its wall. No aneurysm was found in this area.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

        "abstract": "The levels of plasma insulin and C-peptide during exercise and subsequent recovery have been determined in obese non-diabetics, obese diabetics Type II and middle-aged female controls. It has been found that exercise reduces levels of peptides both in the control and in the obese non-diabetic group. This effect of acute exercise was found blunted in the obese diabetic group. Non-diabetic obese subjects pretreated with phentolamine showed no reduction either in plasma insulin or C-peptide levels during exercise. During the recovery, the level of plasma insulin returned promptly to the pre-exercise value in the control group but increased above the resting value in obese subjects, both non-diabetic and diabetic. In controls and non-diabetic obese the increment of C-peptide: insulin molar ratio occurred early after the onset of exercise and then returned to the resting value despite the exercise being continued. The plasma C-peptide:insulin molar ratios were reduced during the first 15 min of recovery period in obese non-diabetic subjects and returned to normal in the next 15 min. The latter may suggest that reduced insulin removal could also contribute to the increase in plasma insulin values in the obese during recovery."

A 5 to 8-year followup is presented in 6 children in whom the abdominal neourethra afforded normal micturition through it or permitted intermittent catheterization. All children were dry between bladder emptyings as a result of a continence mechanism that combined a long elastic tube and a cephalad neourethral abdominal opening with a rectus striated muscle sphincter."

        "abstract": "A prospective study of injuries and disease in a cohort of Australian thoroughbreds in training was conducted with the participation of 24 trainers. From the horses catalogued at a major yearling sale in 1995, 169 were enrolled in the study and followed through their two- and three-year-old racing seasons. The principal aim was to quantify the time lost in training as a result of the various categories of injuries and disease, recorded as either days of modified training, or weeks rested at pasture. Shin soreness was the most common condition in two-year-olds (affecting 42 per cent of the horses that had entered training), followed by fetlock problems (25 per cent), and coughs and nasal discharge (16 per cent). Lameness, excluding lacerations and traumatic injuries, was the most common reason for lost training days (56.2 per cent of total days modified) and for resting horses at pasture (81.2 per cent of total weeks rested for injury or disease). Of the individual categories of injury or disease, lacerations and traumatic injuries, coughs and nasal discharge, shin soreness, carpal problems and fetlock problems were the most important causes of modified training days. In terms of weeks rested at pasture, fetlock problems, shin soreness, carpal problems, and coughs and nasal discharge had the greatest impact. Major injury was uncommon in young horses in training, but there was a high incidence of relatively low-grade injuries and disease during the training of two-year-olds."

        "abstract": "Charts of 1006 consecutive outpatients were reviewed to ascertain the cause of extreme elevation of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (greater than or equal to 100 mm/h) and the sensitivity of marked ESR elevation in patients with disorders commonly reported to cause ESR elevation. Prevalence of ESRs of 100 mm/h or more was 4.2%. Infection was the most common cause (33%), with malignant neoplasms and renal disease each responsible for 17% and inflammatory disorders for 14%. Only 1% of all other patients had ESRs of 100 mm/h or more. An ESR of 100 mm/h or more had low sensitivity: 36% among patients with infection, 25% among those with malignant neoplasms, and 21% among patients with noninfectious inflammatory disorders. Specificity was high, both for individual disease categories (96% for malignant neoplasms and 97% for infection) and as a \"sickness\" index (greater than 99%). The positive predictive value for an identifiable cause of marked ESR elevation was 90%."

They included 10 neuroblastomas, 2 rhabdomyosarcomas, and one each of hepatoblastoma, yolk sac tumor, osteosarcoma and pinealoma. Of 7 cases treated only with cis-DDP, 2 were NC, 6 PD and none were CR or PR. Of 11 cases treated with cis-DDP combined with other agents, 7 were PR, 2 NC, 2 PD and none were CR. The major side effect of cis-DDP was renal toxicity, but this was not serious and only transient. Three cases were treated with the continuous intra-arterial infusion method. These included 2 neuroblastomas and one yolk sac tumor. This treatment was therefore highly effective for children with malignant tumors, and few side effects were observed."

        "abstract": "Information on the effects of crystallization upon the structure of liver alcohol dehydrogenase from horse is obtained from a comparison of the phosphorescence properties of its tryptophan residues in solution and in the crystalline state. In the crystalline state the red shift in the phosphorescence spectrum of the solvent-exposed Trp-15 attests to a decreased polarity of its environment consistent with its shielding away from the aqueous solvent probably through its involvement in an intermolecular contact. On the other hand, the triplet-state lifetime of Trp-314 which is buried deeply in the coenzyme-binding domain demonstrates that the flexibility of this region of the macromolecule is unaffected by crystallization; a conclusion supported also by the similarity in the rate of oxygen quenching of its phosphorescence. Given that lattice constraints strongly inhibit large-scale conformational changes these results allow us to identify the average solution structure with the 'open' conformer determined crystallographically."

        "abstract": "We report a case of a patient with colon carcinoma and liver metastasis who presented chest pain after 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) administration. Clinical electrocardiographic evolution was similar to that observed in Prinzmetal's angina, and chest pain promptly resolved with nifedipine. These data suggest that coronary spasm may be the cause of cardiotoxicity due to 5-FU, and that calcium antagonists may probably be used in the prevention or treatment of 5-FU cardiotoxicity."

        "article_title": "Educational input and patient outcomes: exploring the gap.",
        "abstract": "Over the last two decades, the health care professions in the United Kingdom have seen an unparalleled expansion of continuing professional education (CPE) and development (CPD) programmes; however, there is little empirical evidence that these enhance the care delivered to patients. Further research is also needed to demonstrate that these initiatives are linked to improved patient outcomes. If health care educators are to move towards an 'evidence-based curriculum', some restructuring of courses may be needed. Priorities should be set and decisions made, based on the results of reliable and valid research into the clinical outcomes of CPE. To evaluate courses and demonstrate educational effectiveness solely in terms of student satisfaction is not enough; to survive in the world of evidence-based care, educators must also demonstrate their contribution to clinical effectiveness. However, the neoteric field of impact evaluation lacks not only validated research methods, but also an agreed agenda for future research. Drawing on interviews undertaken with nurses who have participated in education evaluations and the relevant literature, this paper discusses the available data collection instruments and the development of viable research designs and methods, which are urgently needed to assess the outcomes of professional education programmes."

        "abstract": "A gas chromatographic method for the quantitative determination of diethylene glycol in wine, red and white grape juice, and red and white grape juice concentrates is described. The method includes continuous extraction of the diethylene glycol with ethyl acetate by the aid of a rotation perforator. Using the new generation of chemically bonded stationary phases on fused silica together with an appropriate modern cold on-column injection system coupled with an autoanalyzer and a retention gap, the GLC analysis is shown to provide adequate information for quality control purposes. Linearity, precision and recovery with the described procedure were investigated. The precision of the method was studied using a sample containing approximately 65 mg/l diethylene glycol. Twelve separate determinations were performed by the described method; the coefficient of variation was 3.9%. The detection limit of our method is 5 mg/l diethylene glycol both for wine, grape juice and grape juice concentrates. Recovery data are based on wine, grape juice and grape juice concentrates fortified with diethylene glycol at different levels. The ranges of concentration used in this study were 10 mg/l to 10 g/l for wine and 10 mg/l to 100 mg/l for grape juice and grape juice concentrate. The average recovery of diethylene glycol for wine at all concentrations tested was 98.8%; coefficients of variation were between 1.6 and 8.0%. Recoveries of diethylene glycol added to grape juice at the level of 10 mg/l to 100 mg/l were 96% to 109%."

        "abstract": "The several types of neoplastic transformations are accompanied by alterations in the composition of cell glycoproteins, which are major structural components of cell surfaces. One such observed alteration is in the level of sialic acid on the cell surface. In the present investigation, plasma sialic acid levels were measured in normal volunteers and neoplastic patients using thiobarbituric acid spectrophotometric methods. The mean plasma sialic acid level from 124 normal volunteers was 3.0 mumol/ml. The mean for 20 non-malignant patients was 3.2 mumol/ml. Such observed mean values of sialic acid were 3.7 mumol/ml in 64 breast cancer patients, 5.1 mumol/ml in 22 lung cancer patients, 4.1 mumol/ml in 20 colon patients, and 5.0 mumol/ml in 26 patients having ovarian, cervix, pancreas, prostate, thyroid, uterine, squamous cell, esophageal and endometrial cancers. Serial determinations of plasma sialic acid in 15 patients correlated well with the progression and regression of disease. These results indicate that plasma sialic acid levels are elevated over control levels in the different types of cancer patients studied. Assay of plasma sialic acid is not sensitive enough to be used for screening, but could be used as a prognostic determinant in a variety of neoplastic conditions."

        "article_title": "Moral philosophy and suicide.",
        "abstract": "There are two main moral issues regarding suicide: first, whether suicide is morally permissible, and if so, in what circumstances; and second, whether a person who knows that someone is contemplating or attempting suicide has an obligation to intervene and if so, how strong that obligation is. With respect to the first issue, it is difficult to resist the conclusion that suicide is not wrong in itself. To characterize suicide as murder of one's self is incorrect. Even if people who commit suicide deprive the community of some good, there is no general duty to provide good services to others. Theological objections to suicide are not persuasive. And suicide could be rational. For example, if one's scheme of values is to maximize the overall value of experience, and if at some point in the future negative value outweighs positive value, suicide would be rationally indicated. With respect to intervention, different considerations apply to persons involved with someone contemplating or attempting suicide, professionals, and the general public. Those who are involved have their own lives to live and need not alter them even when another person's life is at stake. Professionals should not become paternalistic authorities who keep subjects alive against their will and miserable for indefinite periods. The general public has only a weak duty to save strangers from suicide."

        "abstract": "A morphometric analysis of normal Wistar rat adrenal medulla following perfusion fixation and Araldite embedding, was correlated with catecholamine levels on fresh tissue, measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. The mean volume of whole adrenal is 13.2 mm3 and the mean medullary volume 1.3 mm3. Volume density estimates showed that the medulla is composed of 63% chromaffin tissue with an adrenaline to noradrenaline storing cell ratio of 4.4:1. The vasculature occupies 20%, neuronal tissue 5% and interstitial tissues 12% of the medulla. A comparison was made of cell volumes, cell numbers and volume and surface density estimates of cytoplasmic organelles in adrenaline and noradrenaline storing cells. The mean cell volume of adrenaline storing cells at 1300 micron3 is larger than that of noradrenaline storing cells at 980 micron3. A single adrenal medulla contains 4.4-5.7 X 10(5) adrenaline cells and 1.5-1.9 X 10(5) noradrenaline cells. Chromaffin granules account for approximately 30% of the volume of the cytoplasm; the numerical density of granules at different sites in the cell was calculated for adrenaline cells. The volume density of mitochondria (4%) and the surface density of mitochondrial membranes (the ratio of outer to inner membrane being approximately 1:2.3) were similar in both cell types. Rough endoplasmic reticulum was the only organelle to show a significant difference in volume and surface density between the two cell types. Adrenaline storing cells have stacks of rough endoplasmic reticulum which have two to three times the surface and volume densities of that found diffusely scattered throughout noradrenaline cells. The adrenaline content of an adrenaline storing cell is 0.14 X 10(-6) microM and that of a granule 3.0 X 10(-12) or 3.8 X 10(-12) mumoles depending on the method of calculation. The noradrenaline content of noradrenaline storing cells can only be calculated on the assumption that all noradrenaline is stored in this cell type though it is likely that some is contained within adrenaline cells. Based on this assumption the noradrenaline content is 0.17 X 10(-6) mumoles per cell and 5 X 10(-12) mumoles per granule. The present study provides baseline morphometric data on the rat adrenal medulla at tissue and cellular level correlated with amine levels in adrenaline and noradrenaline storing cells and granules."

        "abstract": "The sequential changes of cell morphology and the ratio distribution of the different types of cells which exist in tubular cysts induced by methylprednisolone acetate have been studied by light, transmission and scanning electron microscopy. We have also studied the blood levels of sodium and potassium by flame photometry. In both control and cystic ducts, at the level of the outer cortex, the first intercalated cells (IC) were not observed until the 4th postnatal day. Some intermediate cell configurations were observed during the 3rd postnatal day, suggesting that some primitive principal cells (PC) are transformed into IC. Development of IC seems to be independent of both the effects of corticoids and the blood levels of potassium. The ratio distribution and the types of IC observed throughout the period studied was similar in both normal and cystic ducts. The type of IC characterized by the presence of a huge apical process, which has gone previously undescribed with either TEM or SEM, was observed in both control and cystic ducts. We propose to name these cells as cells with surface pattern type V. During the period of regression of the tubular cysts dead and migrating cells were observed closely associated with cilia of the PC. Both types of cells do not seem to represent, based in their localization and frequency, abnormal cell types of the cyst wall. Our results support the hypothesis that renal cysts are giant collecting ducts which conserve both the morphology and the function of the epithelium."

        "abstract": "In the present study, we evaluated the pharmacological characteristics of the functional muscarinic receptors implicated in rabbit detrusor contraction and coupled to inositol phospholipid turnover in rabbit detrusor and parotid gland. The selectivity of several muscarinic antagonists for detrusor vs. salivary gland muscarinic receptors was also examined. The affinities for the muscarinic m1-, m2- and m3-receptor subtypes were determined using membranes from human cloned receptors expressed in CHO-K1 cells using [3H]-N-methyl scopolamine as a radioligand. Anti-muscarinic activity was determined in isolated rabbit detrusor by measuring the displacement of the contractile response to carbachol, and in rabbit detrusor and rabbit parotid by measuring the displacement of inositol phospholipid hydrolysis (total inositol phosphate accumulation) to carbachol. A significant correlation was found between the potencies to antagonize carbachol-induced rabbit detrusor contraction (pK(B)) and the affinities (pKi) for the m3-receptor subtype (r = 0.93, P = 5 x 10(-6)). Lower, but significant, correlations [0.88 (P = 6.3 x 10(-5)), 0.72 (P = 4.6 x 10(-3))] were obtained with m1- or m2-receptor subtypes, respectively. Each muscarinic antagonist tested displayed similar potency to antagonize carbachol-stimulated inositol phospholipid hydrolysis in rabbit detrusor and parotid (r = 0.96, P = 8 x 10(-3)). A significant correlation was found between the potencies to antagonize carbachol-stimulated inositol phospholipid hydrolysis (pK(B)), determined in rabbit detrusor and rabbit parotid, and the affinities (pK(i)) for the m3-receptor subtype [r = 0.96 (P = 0.01), 0.99 (P = 5 x 10(-5)), respectively] and for the m1-receptor subtype [r = 0.98 (P = 3.5 x 10(-3)), 0.94 (P = 0.02), respectively] but not for the m2-receptor subtype [r = 0.33, 0.57, ns, respectively]. In each in vitro assay, methoctramine (preferential M2 selective antagonist) and pirenzepine (preferential M1 selective antagonist) were slightly potent. We suggest that the muscarinic receptor implicated in the response to carbachol in rabbit detrusor and parotid gland corresponds to the M3-subtype. None of the muscarinic antagonists studied in rabbit tissues displayed preferential affinity for the detrusor."

        "abstract": "Fifty-three consecutive, unselected patients with invasive bladder cancer, Stage T2 to T3, treated by radical radiotherapy have been reviewed. Cystectomy was reserved for patients with significant worsening of disease during treatment, histologically confirmed persistent or recurrent invasive tumour after treatment, or patients with intolerable symptoms due to radiation cystitis. In 64% of our patients a favourable tumour response to radiotherapy was seen, while a further 31% showed disease progression either during or on completion of radiotherapy. Cystectomy was performed on 22% of patients, mainly for radiation cystitis, and was not associated with a significant operative mortality rate. The crude 5-year survival rate was 42%. We conclude that radical radiotherapy is as effective as other forms of treatment for invasive bladder cancer, but that there remains a need to identify those bladder tumours destined to respond poorly to radiotherapy at an earlier stage."

        "abstract": "Type III collagen is one of the major interstitial collagens and, as such, plays an important role in modulating the structure and function of most tissues. To compare the expression of the type III collagen gene to that of the type I collagen alpha 1(I) and alpha 2(I) genes, cDNAs encoding the 3' one-third of the human alpha 1(III) collagen mRNA were obtained by screening a human fetal lung fibroblast cDNA library with a cloned segment of the chicken alpha 1(III) gene. Northern blot analysis of human fetal lung fibroblast RNA demonstrated two alpha 1(III)-specific mRNAs of sizes 6.6 and 5.8 kilobases, sizes clearly different from those of the type I collagen mRNAs. Analyses of populations of dividing and nondividing human lung fibroblasts revealed that, on a per cell basis, the nondividing population contained twice as much alpha 1(III) mRNA than did the dividing population. The same was true for the type I collagen alpha 1(I) and alpha 2(I) mRNA transcripts. Similar results were obtained when alpha 1(III), alpha 1(I), and alpha 2(I) mRNA transcripts were quantified by using dot blot evaluation of total RNA, Northern analysis of total RNA, and dot blot evaluation of cytoplasmic RNA. Thus, despite the fact that the alpha 1(III) collagen gene is located on a chromosome different from the alpha 1(I) and alpha 2(I) genes, the expression of these three collagen chains appears to be coordinately controlled during periods of rapid and slow fibroblast growth."

The treatment with interferon changed the pattern of secreted proteins from quiescent cells and from cells treated with partially purified PDGF; it inhibited the accumulation of the PDGF-induced proteins (including proteins of 63 and 32 kDa) and it induced the accumulation of several other proteins (including proteins of 89, 31.5, 30, and 10.5 kDa) in both quiescent and also in PDGF-treated cells."

        "abstract": "Three patients presented with atypical subacute epididymal disorders diagnosed clinically as a scrotal tumor. Ultrasound imaging provided satisfactory morphologic data on lesions. Cold surgery was performed, either because of major functional disturbance (multiple epididymal abscesses) or because of doubt with respect to diagnosis (spermatic granuloma and epididymal hematoma). Castration was the final procedure in each case. Even though this surgical attitude appears logical because of the serious nature of the lesions, the revised clinical diagnosis provided by ultrasonography and the very good correlation between pathologic and ultrasonic findings should lead to a more eclectic therapeutic attitude in other cases."

Lidocaine (0.92 mM) blocked nerve and muscle action potentials in the BVC preparation, blocked slow fibre MEPPS, and blocked indirectly elicited muscle contraction. Lidocaine (0.92 mM) non-competitively blocked acetylcholine (ACh) induced contractures of the chick BVC. Gallamine competitively blocked ACh contractures (pA2 6.53) but produced only a relatively weak non-competitive block of TEA induced contractures in lidocaine.

        "abstract": "An NADH oxidase was purified to homogeneity from Leuconostoc mesenteroides with a specific activity 100-fold higher than that of the crude extract. The purified NADH oxidase was an acidic protein having an S0 20,W of 5.49S and a molecular weight of 104,000, consisting of a dimer with 53,000 subunit size. The enzyme could use O2, dichlorophenolindophenol and methylene blue as oxidants, but not H2O2, cytochrome c, or ferricyanide. The physiological substrate was beta-NADH (Km = 0.12 mM) with O2 as the oxidant, probably forming H2O, rather than H2O2. Activity toward alpha-NADH was observed (Km = 0.14 mM), but the maximum velocity was 3 orders of magnitude lower than that with beta-NADH. alpha-NADPH and beta-NADPH were inert for the reaction. The enzyme showed a flavoprotein absorption spectrum with maxima at 273, 379, and 450 nm with a shoulder at 465 nm: the absorption at 450-465 nm disappeared on adding excess NADH or hydrosulfite. One mol of the holoenzyme contained approximately 2 mol of FAD. The apoenzyme was obtained by treatment with EDTA-KBr solution and could be reconstituted partially by adding FAD, but not riboflavin or FMN. The maximum activity of the reaction was observed at pH 6.5 in a temperature range of 35-45 degrees C. The activation energy was estimated to be 3.77 kcal/mol. The enzyme was inhibited by SH reagents, quinacrine, quinine, and Cu2+, but not by EDTA. Adenine and its nucleoside 5'-di- and triphosphates showed competitive inhibitions, while various metabolites, such as H2O2, FDP, acetyl phosphate, lactate, ethanol, and acetate, did not affect the reaction."

        "abstract": "The effect of weight-lifting, which induced muscular enlargement, on fiber number was tested in the flexor carpi radialis muscle by operantly conditioning 6 cats to flex their right wrist against increasing resistance for an average of 101 weeks. The left was used as a control. At the end of training, the cats were performing \"one-arm\" lifts with an average of 57% of their body weight. There was an 11% greater muscle weight (P less than 0.01) and 9% (P less than 0.02) more fibers in the exercised muscles from the right limb than in the left. This study using a different method, supports our earlier observations that prolonged weight-lifting exercise significantly increases the total number of muscle fibers."

        "abstract": "Portal images obtained of patients during irradiation with high energy photon beams have a poor sharpness and contrast due to the physical limitations of the equipment forming these images. Consequently, improvement of the images is desirable. An inverse filter method was investigated for this purpose and values of the parameters of the filter have been determined for various clinical irradiation conditions. Data on the line spread function (LSF) were obtained from the image of a 0.2 mm wide slit between tungsten blocks that were positioned at the isocentre in front of a polystyrene phantom. Slit images were made in a 60Co beam and in a number of 8 and 16 MV x-ray beams with a copper screen-film detector. These images were made for various isocentre to detector distances, field sizes and phantom thicknesses. All slit images and a number of clinical images were digitised both with a TV camera system and a densitometer which were connected to a computer. The main factors that affect the LSF are the radiation source size and the isocentre to film distance. The photon energy had only a minor influence. The thickness of the phantom and the field size, however, did influence the contrast in the image and therefore they determined, together with the digitising system, the noise to signal ratio parameter of the inverse filter to a great extent. Application of the inverse filter improved significantly the visual appearance of anatomical details in the portal images. In addition to image restoration, the contrast was enhanced by the application of a low frequency cut-off filter."

        "abstract": "The intensity dependence of signal processing in the cat cochlea was studied in responses of single auditory-nerve fibers for harmonic complexes having various amplitude and phase spectra. Analyses were based on information present in temporal discharge cadences, and they consisted of assessing Fourier spectra of period histograms synchronized to the period of the waveform fundamental. At low intensities, response spectra resembled filtered versions of the stimulus spectrum, with the amounts of filtering being determined by fibers' tuning curves. At high intensities, response spectra exhibited nonlinear behavior and could differ dramatically from spectra obtained at low intensities. The high-intensity response typically emphasized one or more aspects of the stimulus spectrum. When the stimulus possessed equal component amplitudes and phases, the features that were emphasized at high intensities were the high- and low-frequency edges of the spectrum, and when the component at fiber CF was changed in phase or amplitude relative to the others, fibers primarily signaled the presence of the phase- or amplitude-shifted component. Many of the intensity-dependent changes in response spectra are accounted for by considering the effects of the compressive input-output nonlinearity operating at or peripheral to the hair-cell level on the temporal waveform."

        "abstract": "Effective teaching of physical examination skills requires an evaluation system that can identify trainees who need further instruction. To study the evaluation of physical examination skills by faculty observers and patient instructors, the reliability of their observation of medical students performing a general physical examination was measured. Faculty observers did not reliably evaluate 32% of examination skills. Faculty agreement was lowest when observing components of the head, neck, and abdominal examinations. Patient instructors, with limited faculty training, reliably evaluated 83% of those skills that were reliably assessed by the faculty. These findings demonstrate limitations in the current methods of evaluating performance and point out the need to examine systems of trainee assessment."

The method relies on culturing the cell lines in RPMI 1640 medium containing 8-azaguanine and supplemented with 15% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and large amounts of amino acids and vitamins, and removes the necessity for pretreatment with mutagenic reagents such as ethyl methylsulfonate or X-irradiation. The possibility of obtaining mutant cell lines using the method described here is about 15 times greater than using media without high levels of amino acids and vitamins. Hybridomas produced between mitogen-activated human peripheral blood lymphocytes and an 8-azaguanine-resistant Jurkat mutant cell line (established by this method) were shown to produce soluble T cell-derived macrophage activating factor (MAF)-like material."

This was about 10(3) times larger than the effect of Ca2+ and was several times greater than the action of Co2+. Vanadate anions were without any effect. During the membrane treatment with VO2+, the rotational relaxational time of diphenylhexatriene did not change.

        "abstract": "A choline non-required cell line was established from a rat hepatoma cell line. The line designated R-Y121B X cho was able to grow in choline-deprived medium without serum and lipid. Choline is necessary for the biosynthesis of phosphatidylcholine, which is a main component of cell membranes. Phosphatidylcholine can be synthesized by the methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine in liver cells. Phospholipid composition and incorporation of radiolabeled serine into phosphatidylserine or phosphatidylethanolamine were quite similar in R-Y121B X cho and its parental cells. However R-Y121B X cho cells had higher phosphatidylcholine synthesis activity from radiolabeled methionine than parental cells. These results indicate that choline requirement of mammalian cells depends on the activity of phosphatidylethanolamine methyltransferase."

        "abstract": "The effects of N-(2,5-dimethyl-1H-pyrrol-1-yl)6-(4-morpholinyl)-3-pyridazinamine hydrochloride (MDL-899) on systemic, pulmonary, renal and coronary circulation and on myocardial contractility have been investigated in conscious dogs treated orally. The compound induced a decrease in systemic arterial blood pressure, slow in onset (peak effect at 4 h) and long-lasting (more than 7 h), by reducing total peripheral resistance, while the heart rate, cardiac output, cardiac work and myocardial contractility increased because of the reflex increase in sympathetic drive evoked by the blood pressure fall. Coronary and renal blood flows were increased for a long time. Pulmonary resistance was markedly decreased, but the pulmonary pressure was increased, probably due to the hyperkinetic activity triggered by the increases of cardiac output and heart rate. The hemodynamic changes induced by MDL-899 are qualitatively similar to those induced by hydralazine. The results suggest that the compound belongs to the class of vasodilators that act primarily on systemic arterioles to produce arteriolar dilation."

        "article_title": "Knee rehabilitation following arthroscopic meniscectomy.",
        "abstract": "Guidelines for knee rehabilitation after conventional open meniscectomy are generally well known. Less agreement exists on rehabilitation following arthroscopic meniscectomy. The program is sometimes arbitrary. Rehabilitation should follow a logical progression regardless of the type of surgery performed. Rehabilitation following knee surgery can be divided into four phases: immediate post-operative period, early healing phase, late healing phase, and conditioning for return to preinjury activity. Following arthroscopic surgery, the overall recovery time can be significantly shortened compared to conventional arthrotomy, primarily by decreasing the length of the early postoperative phases. A smaller incision causes less soft-tissue injury to skin, capsule, synovium, and other periarticular structures, resulting in less quadriceps inhibition and a more rapid recovery. The rate of tissue healing is not altered, however, and the knee must still heal completely before the patient can return to a full functional level. Not all patients are rehabilitated uniformly, and a great deal of variability exists following arthroscopic surgery. Factors that affect the speed of rehabilitation and return to normal function are the extent of meniscectomy performed, the coexistence of additional intra- or extra-articular pathology, and individual patient differences. Therefore, an arbitrary time frame for rehabilitation following arthroscopic meniscectomy is not recommended. Rather, each patient should progress from one stage of rehabilitation to the next, based on objective knee findings."

        "abstract": "Modern texts continue to cite Broca's 1861 study of a single patient, Tan, as the first definitive localization of a cerebral function, specifically, articulate speech. We describe the development of Broca's theory from his initial support in 1861 for Bouillaud's view that speech is localized in both frontal lobes to his description in 1865 of a center for articulate speech in the third left frontal convolution. We have translated Broca's 1865 French report. Despite the revival of \"classical\" anatomically based concepts of discrete aphasic syndromes, numerous clinicoanatomical correlation studies have failed to confirm the specific language impairment described by Broca. Broca's own descriptions of language development in the third right frontal convolution following left hemisphere damage also raise questions about the validity of theories of brain-behavior relationships based on punctate localization of specific mental functions."

Papanicolaou-stained cervicovaginal smears and pelvic washings are correlated with tissue sections of endocervical curettage, hysterectomy and cul-de-sac biopsy specimens. Although there was some variation in the cytologic features, the tumor cells were generally distinguished by nuclear molding, indistinct nucleoli, finely granular chromatin and scant cytoplasm. Argyrophil-positive intracytoplasmic granules were identified in tissue sections of the tumor. These granules were positive for ACTH and neuron-specific enolase using the immunoperoxidase technique. Ultrastructural studies were consistent with these findings. Neuroendocrine carcinoma of the cervix is therefore a cytologically distinctive tumor in which psammoma bodies may occur."

Following 8 d of once-daily melatonin treatment the hypothalamic and neurohypophysial oxytocin and vasopressin content was decreased. It might be therefore suggested that melatonin increases the release of neurohypophysial hormones and/or decreases their synthesis. Melatonin did not significantly modify the neurohypophysial vasopressin depletion rate in animals deprived of water up to 8 days. No consistent effects of melatonin on the decrease of hypothalamo-neurohypophysial content of oxytocin were noted under conditions of dehydration and simultaneous administration of melatonin up to 8 d."

Major innovations have occurred in the last three decades since the advent of temporary pacing, and today, pacing can be effected \"physiologically\" in both chambers. This has been the result of improved venous access techniques, technologic improvements in electrode design, and the development of sophisticated external pulse generators. It has become clear that ventricular pacing alone does not improve the hemodynamic derangement consequent upon ventricular bradycardia and AV dyssynchrony. The restoration of AV synchrony either by atrial pacing preceding ventricular events or by ventricular pacing at a defined AV delay following a sensed atrial event (P wave) can often reverse the hemodynamic derangement and result in both extension of life and more rapid reversal of the clinical compromise in certain cases of acute heart block. Temporary pacing has always been used for bradyarrhythmias, but more recently, antitachycardia pacing is being utilized increasingly in the acute care setting."

Alteration of the in-plane symmetry of the electronic structure of haem induced by the ligation of proximal histidyl imidazole spreads the haem carbon resonances to 32 ppm at 22 degrees C, indicating the sensitivity of those resonances to the haem electronic/molecular structure. Those resonances are potentially powerful probes in characterizing the nature of haem electronic structure."

        "abstract": "As a complementary and individualised method CT of the pediatric chest and abdomen facilitates or permits correct diagnosis. Evaluation of neoplasms is the most frequent indication and includes precise definition of the site of origin, the extent of disease and of possible metastases. Moreover, monitoring of the treatment and follow-up studies are made much easier. Traumatic lesions of parenchymal organs are easily estimated with high accuracy. However, the relevant contribution provided by the computer-tomographic cross-sectional display has to be carefully weighed against the effort required for and possible adverse reactions induced by the examination, which altogether may be considered as slightly rather than non-invasive, including the genetic risk of radiation."

        "article_title": "Cell proliferation of the rat gastrointestinal mucosa after treatment with E2 prostaglandins and indomethacin.",
        "abstract": "The frequency of arrested mitoses after vincristine injection was studied in the gastrointestinal mucosa of rats treated with either natural prostaglandin E2 (0.2-5.0 mg X kg-1, b.d.), 15-R-15 methyl prostaglandin E2 (2 mg X kg-1, b.d.) or indomethacin (1.0-3.0 mg X kg-1, b.d.). In addition to the mitotic index, morphometric measurements including the mucosal thickness and the thickness of the proliferative and functional zones of the gastric corpus, antrum and jejunum were performed. Natural prostaglandin E2, at the highest dose range, reduced significantly the mitotic index in the gastric antrum. Normal values were found in the gastric corpus and jejunum and in the antrum with the lower doses. The mitotic index was unaffected by treatment with 15-R-15 methyl prostaglandin E2. Natural prostaglandin E2 produced trophic changes (i.e. increased thickness and/or hyperplasia) in the antrum, functional epithelial zone of the gastric corpus and in the jejunum. More pronounced trophic changes were observed in the mucosa of rats treated with the analogue. Indomethacin reduced the mucosal thickness in all examined epithelia and lowered the mitotic index in the jejunum. It is concluded that the trophic effects of E2 prostaglandins on gastrointestinal epithelia are not caused by increased production of new cells. The reduced mitotic index observed in the antral mucosa of prostaglandin-treated rats could be secondary to a negative feedback from the hyperplastic epithelium. The antitrophic effects of the prostaglandin-synthesis blocker (indomethacin) indicates that endogenous prostaglandins may participate in the epithelial cell regulation of the gastrointestinal tract."

        "abstract": "The hypothesis that adipocyte size and number influence feeding behavior, via as yet unidentified signals to the CNS, is reviewed. The proposal is made that, due to several metabolic alterations which favor lipid deposition, the genetically obese Zucker rat (fafa) may be an appropriate model in which to study feeding-adipose tissue relationships. Data from several studies are presented demonstrating that the developing male Zucker fatty rat displays hyperphagia during the growth period which reaches a peak, or \"break point,\" and then declines such that intake of fatty and lean rats becomes comparable at approximately 20 weeks of age. Beyond week 20, cycles of hyperphagia of several weeks' duration can be detected in fatty rats. The above feeding changes are related to data showing that on a laboratory chow-type diet, adipocytes approach maximal size at 15-16 weeks in the fatty rat, while accelerated proliferation of adipocytes takes place following week 20. During growth, responding for food in an operant task by fatty rats varies in accord with the pattern of hyperphagia. Further studies in the fatty rat show that the duration and magnitude of developmental hyperphagia can be altered by manipulating the caloric density and macronutrient content of the diet, with fat containing diets leading to the earliest break point of developmental hyperphagia. Some theoretical problems with the notion of adipose tissue feedback control of feeding behavior are discussed."

There was no mortality, and minimal morbidity, with this procedure. Cannulation should be performed in most cases on the first insertion of the needle, and the Seldinger technique using a J-wire aids in catheter placement. Though we did not cause pneumothorax, the inability to obtain a chest x ray prior to the operative procedure in most patients causes us to suggest that this technique be used only on those patients requiring an open chest operative procedure."

        "abstract": "A single exposure to 1,2-dimethylhydrazine [(DMH) CAS: 540-73-8] produces several forms of aberrant nuclei in the crypts of the murine colon. The frequency of nuclear aberrations (NAs) was examined in the distal colonic crypts in DMH-sensitive A/J mice and relatively DMH-resistant C57BL/6J mice before and after a single exposure to DMH. NAs, mitotic figures, and crypt column heights were scored for all animals as a function of time following administration of DMH. In both strains there was a significant increase in the absolute and relative frequency of NAs by 12 hours, with a corresponding drop and subsequent overshoot in the mitotic index by 48 hours after DMH. The temporal changes in crypt column height correlate closely with the temporal changes in frequency of NAs in both strains. The results showed that both inbred strains respond to acute DMH exposure in a similar and parallel fashion over time. It was concluded that the NA index assay is a sensitive method for detecting early DMH exposure. However, this assay does not relate to ultimate outcome after chronic DMH exposure and should not be used as a predictor of eventual neoplastic transformation of colonic mucosa with this carcinogen."

        "abstract": "Rate of accumulation of myocardial S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) was used in an open-chest dog preparation as an index of free cytosolic adenosine levels. Following 30 minutes of coronary artery ligation and infusion of L-homocysteine thiolactone (10 mumol/kg/min i.v.) SAH levels increased from 1.3 (control) to 3.3 nmoles/g in the nonischemic and to values over 100 nmoles/g in the ischemic region. Compared with regional myocardial blood flow the enhanced rate of SAH accumulation was strictly confined to the ischemic area. As long as blood flow was 0.6-1.2 ml/min/g, SAH levels remained unchanged. However, they steeply increased when regional myocardial blood flow decreased below 60% of control. Tissue levels of adenine nucleotides, adenosine, and lactate were not significantly affected in the flow range of 0.4-0.6 ml/min/g but rate of SAH accumulation was enhanced by 400%. In the nonischemic myocardium, SAH accumulation was 60% higher in the subendocardium than in the subepicardium. Decreasing coronary perfusion pressure from 110 to 60, 45, and 35 mm Hg was associated with an exponential increase in coronary venous adenosine release only when perfusion pressure was below 60 mm Hg. Transmural mapping of SAH revealed that at 110 mm Hg SAH was homogeneously distributed, while at a perfusion pressure of 60 mm Hg SAH accumulation was enhanced only in the subendocardial layers. Decreasing perfusion pressure further to 40 and 30 mm Hg not only enhanced subendocardial SAH levels to 120 and 170 nmoles/g, respectively, but also considerably steepened the transmural gradient of SAH. SAH-hydrolase exhibited a broad pH-optimum and its activity in different parts of ventricular myocardium was identical. Our findings provide evidence that 1) measurement of SAH accumulation is a sensitive metabolic index for the assessment of regional myocardial ischemia, 2) significant formation of SAH occurs only when regional myocardial blood flow is less than 0.6 ml/min/g, and 3) transmural SAH gradient, a measure of free cytosolic adenosine, and coronary venous adenosine release significantly increase only when the autoregulatory reserve is exhausted."

The effect of different solvent compositions and temperatures on elution time and resolution have been studied. These studies have been used to devise a method for reversed-phase liquid chromatographic separation of bovine, porcine, and human insulin, as well as the A and B chains of bovine insulin. The method can also be used for the separation of the various products of the iodination of porcine insulin. 125I-A14 tyrosine-labeled porcine insulin can be readily separated from nonlabeled porcine insulin and from other iodinated constituents of the mixture. A flow-though gamma-counting system that was designed for this work is described."

        "abstract": "Two experiments are reported concerning the neural substrate of conditioned taste aversion (CTA) and the amnesic mechanisms involved when such learning is disrupted by electroconvulsive shock (ECS). Subjects were adult male rats. In the first experiment it is demonstrated that an aversion established to a 2.5% sucrose solution can simulate the learning loss reported in earlier studies which was caused by interpolating ECS between tasting and illness when the aversion was established using a 10% sucrose cue. It is concluded that if ECS acts to disrupt the memory of the taste cue, it possibly reduces it to only about one-quarter of its original strength, a substantial deficit not readily apparent simply from the degree of aversion displayed. In the second experiment, CTAs were established using either a 2.5% sucrose cue or a 10% cue with ECS interpolated during the taste-illness interval. Animals in the two groups were subsequently confronted with a range of sucrose stimuli and their respective aversions were compared. Near identical responses were observed under all conditions tested. These findings are consistent with the theory that ECS disrupts CTA by weakening the gustatory engram."

        "article_title": "Interhospital transportation. Monitoring sterility of instrument packs.",
        "abstract": "The Minneapolis-St Paul area is currently experiencing an increase in health care mergers among hospitals. As new facilities are acquired, whether through merger or the building of satellite hospitals, economic considerations often instigate the consolidation of certain departments and services. Thus, hospitals are confronted with a new set of management problems. One such problem might be determining if the probability of contamination increases when a sterile pack is transported from the central sterile supply department of one hospital to the operating room of another hospital. This study indicates that interhospital transport of surgical packs, using a specially designed transfer system, can be accomplished without compromising the sterile status to a significantly greater degree than that associated with transport within a hospital. Many more samples would have to be assayed before these results could be considered conclusive. This study proposes a simple, reproducible, microbiologically sensitive and statistically satisfactory test to monitor the sterile integrity of surgical packs. In the past, different sterility monitoring methods proposed have required either special equipment, specially trained personnel, or complicated procedures. The assay method described here can be easily used by central sterile supply department personnel to monitor the sterile status of transported or stored surgical packs."

        "article_title": "Fungal fragments as indoor air biocontaminants.",
        "abstract": "The aerosolization process of fungal propagules of three species (Aspergillus versicolor, Penicillium melinii, and Cladosporium cladosporioides) was studied by using a newly designed and constructed aerosolization chamber. We discovered that fungal fragments are aerosolized simultaneously with spores from contaminated agar and ceiling tile surfaces. Concentration measurements with an optical particle counter showed that the fragments are released in higher numbers (up to 320 times) than the spores. The release of fungal propagules varied depending on the fungal species, the air velocity above the contaminated surface, and the texture and vibration of the contaminated material. In contrast to spores, the release of fragments from smooth surfaces was not affected by air velocity, indicating a different release mechanism. Correlation analysis showed that the number of released fragments cannot be predicted on the basis of the number of spores. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays with monoclonal antibodies produced against Aspergillus and Penicillium fungal species showed that fragments and spores share common antigens, which not only confirmed the fungal origin of the fragments but also established their potential biological relevance. The considerable immunological reactivity, the high number, and the small particle size of the fungal fragments may contribute to human health effects that have been detected in buildings with mold problems but had no scientific explanation until now. This study suggests that future fungal spore investigations in buildings with mold problems should include the quantitation of fungal fragments."

While it is clear that the SOCS proteins are involved in the negative regulation of cytokine signaling, the biological roles of the other SOCS box-containing families are unknown. We have investigated Asb-1 function by generating mice that lack this protein, as well as mice that overexpress full-length or truncated Asb-1 in a wide range of tissues. Although Asb-1 is expressed in multiple organs, including the hematopoietic compartment in wild-type mice, Asb-1(-/-) mice develop normally and exhibit no anomalies of mature blood cells or their progenitors. While most organs in these mice appear normal, the testes of Asb-1(-/-) mice display a diminution of spermatogenesis with less complete filling of seminiferous tubules. In contrast, the widespread overexpression of Asb-1 in the mouse has no apparent deleterious effects."

(1967, 1968, 1971), has been purified from RIII mouse milk MMTV by sequential ion-exchange and gel chromatography. The purified protein with sl antigenic reactivity contains carbohydrate, and has an apparent minimal molecular weight of 52,000. It can be designated as gp52 (sl). Another major MMTV viral protein with a molecular weight of 27,000 has also been isolated, and antisera have been prepared against it. Both MMTV gp52 (sl) and p27 viral polypeptides have been iodinated with (125)I and used in immunoprecipitation and competition assays. The two MMTV proteins differ absolutely from each other and from major mouse type C viral polypeptides in molecular weight, immunological reactivity, and amino acid composition. Purified gp52 (sl) in radioimmunoprecipitation inhibition assays reacted in two distinct patterns. One pattern showed partial displacement of antibody which could be converted to the second, a complete displacement, by heating the antigen, presumably by exposing additional reactive determinants. Biologically, the patterns of major MMTV polypeptide expression in milk correlated with spontaneous mammary tumor incidence in different strains of mice, indicating that the sl antigen is group specific for MMTV or that several mouse strains contain the same virus type."

        "abstract": "Until now the relation between advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and vascular lesion is still controversial. However, the interaction of the former with a receptor triggers the synthesis of cytokines particularly interleukin 1- beta(IL-1 beta) and tumour necrosis factor- alpha(TNFalpha ). Subsequent release of nitric oxide (NO) may in turn induce certain damage to beta cell islets. Several arguments indicated that AGEs and reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs) could alter the function of the vessel wall. Therefore, this study was undertaken to investigate the effectiveness of aminoguanidine, AG (inhibitor of AGE formation) joined with omega -3-fatty acids, omega 3FAs (anti-inflammatory immunosuppressive drug) in STZ diabetic rats. Diabetes was induced in 48 female albino Wistar rats by a single intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of streptozotocin (STZ, 50 mg kg (-1)). Diabetic animals were treated with AG (50 mg kg(-1) ) and/or omega 3FAs (12 mg kg (-1)) daily and orally for 4 weeks. Groups of age matched diabetic rats ( n= 10) and healthy animals ( n= 10) served as positive and negative controls. At the end of the study, plasma glucose, fructosamine, total cholesterol (TC), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC), the susceptibility of LDL to copper-catalysed oxidation, catalase activity, NO, IL-1 beta, TNF alpha were measured. Histopathological assessment of pancreatic slices were also determined. Diabetes remarkably increased plasma glucose, fructosamine and dyslipidaemia (increased TC, LDLC and decreased HDLC). Oxidative markers like oxidative susceptibility of LDL, catalase activity and NO levels were greatly enhanced. Finally, it increased the synthesis and release of cytokine (IL-1beta and TNF alpha). Treatment of diabetic rats with AG and omega 3FAs markedly reduced the above mentioned parameters. Combined form therapy has a better effect regarding oxidative cell markers, specifically NO level. Finally, omega 3FAs coadministration with AG nearly restored the atrophy of islets of Langerhan's and the peripheral lymphocytic infiltration compared to diabetic and AG treated groups. In conclusion, there is a direct correlation between glycation, oxidative stress and cytokine production with increased propensity of microvascular disorder in STZ diabetic rats. omega 3FA administration with AGE receptor blocker may represent a possible avenue of research for therapeutics directed for alleviating the complication associated with diabetes."

        "abstract": "Tandem mass spectrometric methods have been evaluated for the characterisation of the type and the differentiation of the interglycosidic linkage of isomeric flavonoid O-diglycosides. Based on the occurrence of internal monosaccharide residue loss and the relative abundances of Y-type ions formed by fragmentation at glycosidic bonds, four pairs of isomeric flavonoid O-diglycosides can be unambiguously differentiated. The different techniques used, i.e. linked scanning at constant B/E without collisional activation and low-energy collision-induced dissociation using methane or helium as collision gas, have been shown to be useful for distinguishing the two most common (1, 2- and 1, 6-) interglycosidic linkages, e.g. flavonoid O-neohesperidosides and O-rutinosides."

These mesosomes appeared to develop, in dividing cells, as coiled infoldings of the cytoplasmic membrane. Mature mesosomes formed a link between the cytoplasmic membrane and the nucleus of the cell. The arrangement of the mesosomes in dividing cells led to the hypothesis that division of the nucleus in these cells is accomplished by two separate polar mesosomes. One mesosome is derived from the parent cell and is present at one pole of the daughter cell. The other is freshly synthesized at or near the newly forming pole of the daughter cell. While the old mesosome remains attached to the chromosome received from the parent cell, the newly synthesized mesosome becomes attached to and initiates replication of the new chromosome. As the cell grows and elongates, the two mesosomes, attached to their respective chromosomes move apart, thus effecting nuclear division."

        "abstract": "Establishing thermodynamic parameters for electron transfer reactions involving redox proteins is essential for a complete description of these important reactions. While various methods have been developed for measuring the Gibbs free energy change (Delta G(HR) or E(m)) for the protein half-reactions, deconvolution of the respective contributions of enthalpy (Delta H(HR)) and entropy (Delta S(HR)) changes is much more challenging. In the present work, an approach is developed using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) that allows accurate determination of all of these thermodynamic parameters for protein electron transfer half-reactions. The approach was validated for essentially irreversible and reversible electron transfer reactions between well-characterized mediators and between mediators and the protein cytochrome c. In all cases, the measured thermodynamic parameters were in excellent agreement with parameters determined by electrochemical methods. Finally, the calorimetry approach was used to determine thermodynamic parameters for electron transfer reactions of the nitrogenase Fe protein [4Fe-4S](2+/+) couple in the absence or presence of MgADP or MgATP. The E(m) value was found to change from -290 mV in the absence of nucleotides to -381 mV with MgATP and -423 mV with MgADP, consistent with earlier values. For the first time, the enthalpy (Delta H(HR)) and entropy (Delta S(HR)) contributions for each case were established, revealing shifts in the contribution of each thermodynamic parameter induced by nucleotide binding. The results are discussed in the context of current models for electron transfer in nitrogenase."

        "abstract": "Factors involved in the hyperlipidemia of nephrosis have been studied in seven patients. The turnover of triglyceride was measured in plasma very low density lipoproteins after the injection of glycerol-(14)C. The turnover of esterified cholesterol was measured in whole plasma and in very low density lipoproteins after the injection of mevalonic acid-2-(3)H. Urine protein loss was found to be significantly correlated with the plasma concentrations of triglyceride and free cholesterol, suggesting that increasing loss of protein is associated with the formation of larger lipoproteins. Lactescent plasmas were found in the subjects with the greatest protein loss. The turnover rate of triglyceride tended to be higher among subjects with higher than with lower triglyceride concentrations and was on the average higher than among six normotriglyceridemic subjects. However, there was also evidence for decreased clearance of glyceride from plasma. The hypertriglyceridemia of nephrosis appeared to reflect both increased formation of glyceride and decreased removal of glyceride from plasma. The turnover of esterified cholesterol was significantly higher in whole plasma of nephrotic subjects than in normocholesterolemic nonnephrotic patients. Esterified cholesterol turnover in very low density lipoproteins was raised in the two subjects in whom a major part of total esterified cholesterol was carried in this lipoprotein fraction. These studies were repeated in one subject after remission was induced. The cessation of urinary loss of protein was associated with reductions in the concentrations and turnover of triglyceride and esterified cholesterol. The increased turnover of plasma lipids in nephrosis may reflect the general increase in the formation of protein."

        "abstract": "We report the case of a presenile woman with Cotard syndrome, in the context of major depression, who showed an improvement in bilateral frontal hypoperfusion in a SPECT study using 99mTc-HMPAO after undergoing successful treatment with antidepressant therapy. We also retrospectively evaluated her clinical course based on the clinical stages. The symptoms of Cotard syndrome have been reported to change dramatically according to the stages. This peculiarity made it difficult for us to rapidly diagnose Cotard syndrome in the context of major depression, and not dementia, and thereby adequately treat the patient in our case. Differences in the reduced blood flow regions and a time lag from psychiatric remission were observed before the improvement in the SPECT findings when comparing our case with a previously reported case of Cotard syndrome. These differences suggest that the mechanism of Cotard syndrome is still not well understood at the present time."

        "abstract": "Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is increasingly diagnosed in children and adolescents, but its long-term prognosis remains uncertain. The aim of this longitudinal, cohort study was to determine the long-term outcome of children with PSC. Fifty-two children with cholangiography-proven PSC (34 boys and 18 girls; mean age 13.8 +/- 4.2 years; range, 1.5-19.6 years) who were seen at our institution over a 20-year period were followed-up for up to 16.7 years. Two thirds presented with symptoms and/or signs of PSC and 81% had concomitant inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Twenty-five percent had total alkaline phosphatase activity within the normal range for the age group, but all of them had elevated gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase levels. Autoimmune hepatitis overlapping with PSC was present in 35% of children. A positive but transient clinical and/or biochemical response occurred under therapy with ursodeoxycholic acid, alone or in combination with immunosuppressive medications. During follow-up, 11 children underwent liver transplantation for end-stage PSC and 1 child died. The median (50%) survival free of liver transplantation was 12.7 years. Compared with an age- and gender-matched U.S. population, survival was significantly shorter in children with PSC (P <.001). In a Cox regression model, lower platelet count, splenomegaly, and older age were associated with shorter survival. Presence of autoimmune hepatitis overlapping with PSC (P =.2) or medical therapy (P =.2) did not affect survival. In conclusion, PSC significantly decreases survival in this child population. Although pharmacologic therapy may improve symptoms and liver test results initially, it does not seem to impact the long-term outcome."

        "abstract": "Previous reports offer limited support for an association between cigarette smoking and Hodgkin's disease. The authors investigated dose-response effects for smoking in relation to the risk of Hodgkin's disease using data from the Selected Cancers Study. Cases (n = 343) were men aged 32-60 years identified from eight US population-based cancer registries in 1984-1988. Controls (n = 1,910) were men recruited by random digit telephone dialing and frequency matched to cases by age and registry. Conditional logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals adjusted for age, registry, race/ethnicity, Jewish upbringing, education, and childhood domicile. Compared with never smokers, current smokers had a significantly increased risk of Hodgkin's disease (odds ratio (OR) = 1.8, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.3, 2.9). Risks increased linearly (p < 0.001) with increasing packs per day (OR(>or=2) = 2.5, 95% CI: 1.6, 4.0), years (OR(>or=30) = 2.4, 95% CI: 1.5, 3.9), and pack-years (OR(>40) = 2.7, 95% CI: 1.8, 4.3) of smoking. These associations were significant for the nodular sclerosis and mixed cellularity subtypes but were much stronger for mixed cellularity. Stratified analyses by age (<or=42 years, >42 years) and subtype suggested that the effects of smoking are more closely related to histology than age. In contrast to findings from previous studies, these data suggest that smoking is an important preventable risk factor for Hodgkin's disease."

Partial generalization also occurred with clonidine and xylazine. Rats discriminating intraperitoneal injections of 5 mg/kg of yohimbine from saline generalized LSD at doses of 0.08-0.63 mg/kg. The data establish an equivalence between LSD and yohimbine as to discriminative effects in rats. This equivalence is consistent with LSD and yohimbine producing at least partly similar subjective effects in humans."

Abnormalities in these markers of infection were found to be significantly more common in cases that were refractory to tocolysis. These cases also showed both pathologic evidence of chorioamnionitis and a significantly greater neonatal early infectious morbidity. We conclude that silent chorioamnionitis is a significant cause of \"uncomplicated\" preterm labor refractory to conventional methods of tocolysis."

        "abstract": "We report on an infant with the prune belly syndrome who was unusual in that the typical manifestations of the disorder were accompanied by an anterior abdominal wall defect. We speculate that this defect may have occurred as a result of splitting of the abdominal wall secondary to massive bladder dilatation and stretching of the abdominal muscles. An alternative explanation is that the defect may have been the result of secondary pressure necrosis from stretching forces or from contact with another structure, such as the cervix. This case lends further support to the hypothesis that bladder distention with overdistention of the abdomen may be the primary event leading to the findings observed in the prune belly syndrome."

Alterations in the activity of the enzymes studied underlie the adaptational syndrome. During 6-hour occlusions the activity of monoamine oxidase was relatively decreased. Meanwhile the content of serotonin and noradrenaline remained at a high level. These amines might participate in the development of pronounced hypoxic impairments seen in the course of the observation period. It is recommended that adrenoblockers and inhibitors of synthesis of serotonin or serotonin-reactive structures may be used for correction of metabolic disorders."

The higher incidence of bone fractures in the placebo group was not significant. Serum calcium, phosphorus, creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase were followed: the greatest changes occurred with methandienone, which thus reduced osteoporotic activity and increased the muscular mass most effectively; calcium carbonate had the poorest effect. Surprisingly, coronary mortality was higher among those taking all three active substances. With two treatments the increase was not significant, but when both the groups receiving a combination of any two of the treatments were compared with those taking only one or neither of these two treatments, a significant increase in coronary deaths was seen, most significant (P less than 0.001) in those receiving vitamin D3 and methandienone."

        "abstract": "The thermotropic behaviour of egg yolk phosphatidylethanolamine dispersions in excess aqueous phase has been investigated by spin label electron spin resonance spectroscopy and differential thermal analysis. Phosphatidylethanolamine isomers spin-labelled at six different positions along the acyl chain, and steroid spin labels, indicate both gel-fluid lamellar and lamellar-reverse hexagonal (HII) phase transitions, in agreement with complementary calorimetric studies. Analysis of spin label data shows that the transition to the HII phase is accompanied by an increase in conformational freedom of the acyl chain, more pronounced towards the methyl terminus, and representing an increase in the population of gauche isomers which can only be accommodated by a transition to the non-bilayer phase. Raising the bulk pH to, and above, pH 8.5 results in stabilisation of the bilayer phase and no transition to the HII phase is observed. The phosphatidylethanolamine spin labels also indicate a polarity profile which is characteristic of each phase."

We characterized the viral DNA forms found in infected cells prepared by a modified Hirt extraction procedure. Double-stranded DNA molecules corresponding in size to 4.8-kilobase-pair duplex monomers and 9.6-kilobase-pair duplex dimers were identified in agarose gels by blot hybridization to 32P-labeled ADV DNA. A rapidly reannealing ADV duplex monomer was isolated on a preparative scale and physically mapped with a series of restriction endonucleases. The map derived was similar to one derived from double-stranded ADV DNA produced by self-primed synthesis on virion DNA, but differed from restriction endonuclease maps reported for other parvovirus DNAs. The purified duplex monomer could be labeled with [32P]dCTP by nick translation and used as a probe in blot hybridization to detect ADV sequences in DNA from small numbers of infected cells. Additional studies indicated that double-stranded ADV DNA could first be detected at 24 h after infection."

        "abstract": "The permeability of the mature placenta of the guinea-pig has been measured to several polar non-electrolytes of differing molecular weights and to two cations. Two methods were used: on the one hand, direct analysis of the fetus after it has taken up labelled solutes from maternal blood, and, on the other, perfusion of the umbilical circulation in situ. In the intact condition, fluorescein dextran of 3000 molecular weight and 51Cr-EDTA permeated from mother to fetus at rates proportional to their free diffusion coefficients in water, indicating the presence of large pores. Perfusion of the umbilical circulation with a physiological salt solution containing dextran increased permeability to these two solutes and hence total pore area three to four times. The movement of 14C-erythritol, 24Na and 42K was such as to suggest that they also cross the placenta by an additional route (or routes), which is not enchanced by perfusion. This route presumably traverses the plasma membranes of the syncytiotrophoblast."

        "abstract": "This study was designed to evaluate systematically the effects of stress on actions of exogenously administered opioids. Dose- and time-dependent analgesic (tail-flick) and thermic (core body temperature) effects of morphine and methadone were determined in unstressed rats and in rats exposed to the stress of restraint or a cold environment. To assess the role of the pituitary-adrencortical axis in stress-opioid interactions, tests were performed in hypophysectomized and pituitary-intact rats. The analgesic effect of morphine was greater in all stressed groups than in unstressed controls and was greater still in all groups of hypophysectomized rats than in corresponding groups of intact animals. The analgesic effect of methadone was also greater in all groups of stressed as compared to unstressed rats but was not modified by hypophysectomy, in contrast to the situation with morphine. The effects of both opioids on body temperature varied quantitatively and qualitatively as a function of dose, conditions under which the animals were tested and presence or absence of the pituitary gland. Doses that increased temperature in unstressed pituitary-intact rats decreased temperature in unstressed hypophysectomized rats and in all stressed rats. Brain and plasma levels of morphine were comparable in stressed and unstressed pituitary-intact rats, but were significantly higher in unstressed hypophysectomized animals. Thus, hypophysectomy-induced potentiation of the analgesic effect of morphine is probably due to pharmacokinetic factors whereas stress-induced potentiation of opioid analgesia appears to be a distinct phenomenon, one that is independent of the pituitary-adrencortical axis and general for the pharmacologic class of morphine-like drugs. The well-documented hypothermic response of restrained rats to doses of opioids that increase or have no affect on the body temperature of unrestrained animals appears to represent another example of stress-induced potentiation of opioid effects."

        "abstract": "Adrenalectomy performed at the same time as, or 12 h after, castration delays the postcastration rise in LH and FSH for at least 12 h. We tested three mechanisms previously advanced as possible mediators in this suppression: 1) blocking PRL in castrate-adrenalectomized males with bromoergocryptine did not restore the normal postcastration rise in serum LH and FSH, eliminating high PRL levels as a cause of this gonadotropin suppression; 2) exogenous ACTH given at the time of orchidectomy did not inhibit either gonadotropin, eliminating high peripheral ACTH as an agent of adrenalectomy-induced suppression of LH and FSH; and 3) intestinal traction performed at the same time as orchidectomy suppressed the secretion of LH and FSH to the same degree as adrenalectomy, ruling out the lack of any adrenal factor as a means by which adrenalectomy blocked gonadotropin secretion. Our data suggest that the adrenalectomy-induced suppression of LH is due to a neurally mediated stress response probably resulting in suppression of GnRH secretion. In other treatment groups, we implanted cortisol before surgery to test the effect of ACTH suppression on LH and FSH secretion in castrate-adrenalectomized animals. A striking divergence between LH and FSH was seen in response to cortisol treatment. Cortisol suppressed LH, but not FSH, in castrate animals, and restored postcastration FSH, but not LH, secretion 12 h after combined castration-adrenalectomy. This divergence between LH and FSH secretion suggests that the effect of adrenalectomy on the two gonadotropins might result from different mechanisms. It is also possible that the differential effect of cortisol on LH and FSH secretion is not relevant to the effect of adrenalectomy on the postcastration secretion of these gonadotropins. These data add to the evidence, however, that LH and FSH are regulated by different mechanisms under many experimental conditions, including stress and elevated corticoid levels."

The sensor is 2.5 mm square, tests on the heart, and responds to flow changes only within a region of tissue 3-4 mm below its location on the epicardial surface. Initial studies demonstrate excellent sensitivity, good frequency response with a time constant of the order of 10-11 s, and an ability to continuously monitor changes in local myocardial blood flow during a variety of well-understood interventions, including coronary artery occlusion, reactive hyperemia, and intravenous administration of nitroglycerin and dipyridamole."

The preparation consists of round or oval vesicles mostly devoid of nucleoids with a diameter ranging from 70-700 nm; open sheets are found very infrequently. Mitochondrial profiles as well as vesicles containing cytochemically demonstrable glucose 6-phosphatase are scarce; accordingly, glucose 6-phosphatase is nearly undetectable biochemically. Monoamine oxidase is absent in peroxisomal membranes. Cytochrome b5 is found in a concentration of 0.3 nmoles/mg protein, an order of magnitude comparable to the content of endoplasmic reticulum membranes. Reduction of this cytochrome with palmitoyl-CoA is possible only after recombination of the membranes with the soluble peroxisomal matrix fraction."

        "abstract": "Two proviruses were cloned from EcoRI-digested DNA extracted from mink cells chronically infected with AKR mink cell focus-forming (MCF) 247 murine leukemia virus (MuLV), using a lambda phage host vector system. One cloned MuLV DNA fragment (designated MCF 1) contained sequences extending 6.8 kilobases from an EcoRI restriction site in the 5' long terminal repeat (LTR) to an EcoRI site located in the envelope (env) region and was indistinguishable by restriction endonuclease mapping for 5.1 kilobases (except for the EcoRI site in the LTR) from the 5' end of AKR ecotropic proviral DNA. The DNA segment extending from 5.1 to 6.8 kilobases contained several restriction sites that were not present in the AKR ecotropic provirus. A 0.5-kilobase DNA segment located at the 3' end of MCF 1 DNA contained sequences which hybridized to a xenotropic env-specific DNA probe but not to labeled ecotropic env-specific DNA. This dual character of MCF 1 proviral DNA was also confirmed by analyzing heteroduplex molecules by electron microscopy. The second cloned proviral DNA (designated MCF 2) was a 6.9-kilobase EcoRI DNA fragment which contained LTR sequences at each end and a 2.0-kilobase deletion encompassing most of the env region. The MCF 2 proviral DNA proved to be a useful reagent for detecting LTRs electron microscopically due to the presence of nonoverlapping, terminally located LTR sequences which effected its circularization with DNAs containing homologous LTR sequences. Nucleotide sequence analysis demonstrated the presence of a 104-base-pair direct repeat in the LTR of MCF 2 DNA. In contrast, only a single copy of the reiterated component of the direct repeat was present in MCF 1 DNA."

        "abstract": "Optical methods were tested for measuring the membrane potential changes of mitochondria in isolated perfused rat hearts. Safranin was found to be rapidly taken up by the Langendorff-perfused heart, and after loading with the dye there was practically no washout of the stain during perfusion with Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution. Staining with safranin induced the appearance of an intense absorption band in the reflectance spectrum of the heart, but the absorbance spectrum changes were not useful for monitoring the mitochondrial membrane potential changes because of interference by endogenous hemoproteins. The fluorescence intensity, however, responded in a manner which indicated that its changes originated from dye attached to the mitochondria. A decrease of the fluorescence was found on energizing the mitochondria by decreasing the cellular energy consumption by arrest induced by 18 mM K+ or by decreasing the beating rate of an electrically paced heart from 5 Hz to the endogenous ventricular frequency of 1.5 Hz. In hearts arrested by Ca2+ depletion, 18 mM K+ did not affect the safranin fluorescence. This was taken to indicate that under these conditions the safranin fluorescence was not sensitive to the plasma membrane potential. The uncoupler carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone induced an intense enhancement of safranin fluorescence in the perfused heart, demonstrating that the probe is sensitive to mitochondrial membrane potential.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

The results were compared with findings obtained with the aminopyrine (AP) clearance method in Heidenhain pouch preparations. Pentagastrin at 2 and 8 micrograms/kg/hr had no effects on GMBF, as measured by the hydrogen clearance method, but there was a marked increase in GMBF when the AP clearance method was used. Histamine at 40 or 160 micrograms/kg/hr tended to reduce or significantly reduced GMBF when measured with the hydrogen clearance method, but there was a significant increase in GMBF with the AP clearance method. Both PGI2 (3 or 30 micrograms/kg/hr) and vasopressin (0.06 or 0.25 units/kg/hr) reduced GMBF as determined by both methods. These results indicate that the hydrogen clearance method is advantageous for detecting regional GMBF but is disadvantageous when attempting to detect the effects of agents which increase GMBF."

        "abstract": "Simultaneous, bilateral fracture of the neck of the femur is rare; the number of reported cases does not exceed 10. Those fractures which occur as a result of electric shock, whether accidental or controlled, i.e. electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), account for almost 50 per cent of reported cases, while violent injury and epilepsy account for the remainder. This study combines a report of 1 case of bilateral fracture of the neck of the femur due to accidental electric shock with a review of the literature to discover the frequency of these fractures."

        "abstract": "IgE antibodies were produced in mice and rats by immunization with ragweed pollen extract (RAG) or dinitrophenylated ovalbumin (DNP3-OA). Treatment of these animals with tolerogenic conjugates of (i) the antigen (RAG or OA) with monomethoxypolyethylene glycol (mPEG), or (ii) DNP with polyvinyl alcohol (DNP-PVA) resulted, within 7-14 days, in a fall in circulating IgE antibodies and in mast cell sensitivity, as assessed by the radioallergosorbent test (RAST) and in the in vitro antigen-induced histamine release (HR) test, respectively. The reduction in responsiveness was more marked in mice than rats; 10 days after a booster immunization, the IgE antibody titres in the RAG-mPEG-treated group of mice were approximately 10-fold lower than in the saline-treated group, with a 100-fold difference in cell sensitivity. DNP-PVA treatment of mice produced a more than 10-fold reduction in IgE anti-DNP titres with a substantial reduction in histamine release."

        "abstract": "Studies on the substrate specificity, kcat/Km, and effect of inhibitors on the human placental NADP-linked 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (9-ketoprostaglandin reductase) indicate that it is very similar to a human brain carbonyl reductase which also possesses 9-ketoprostaglandin reductase activity. These observations led to a comparison of three apparently homogeneous 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenases with varying amounts of 9-ketoprostaglandin reductase activity: an NAD- and an NADP-linked enzyme from human placenta and an NADP-linked enzyme from rabbit kidney. All three enzymes are carbonyl reductases for certain non-prostaglandin compounds. The placental NAD-linked enzyme, which has no 9-ketoprostaglandin reductase activity, is the most specific of the three. Although it has carbonyl reductase activity, a comparison of the Km and kcat/Km for prostaglandin and non-prostaglandin substrates of this enzyme suggests that its most likely function is as a 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase. The results of similar comparisons imply that the other two enzymes may function as less specific carbonyl reductases."

        "abstract": "The tumor promoter, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), has several effects on the immune system. The effect of TPA on the in vitro antibody response to sheep red blood cells (sRBC) was studied. Spleen cells treated in vitro with TPA resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of the IgM antibody forming cell (AFC) response with an IC50 of 0.74 nM. Nontumor promoting analogs at concentrations up to 1000 nM had no effect on this system. 2-Mercaptoethanol (2ME), which is known to augment macrophage function in this assay, did not reverse the inhibition. Spleen cells were separated into plastic adherent cells (ADC) and nonadherent cells (NAC). When NAC were treated with TPA and cultured with untreated ADC, the inhibition was seen. However, treating the ADC alone did not result in an inhibition. These results show that TPA will suppress the in vitro antibody response in the mouse and that the suppression is due to a selective effect on the plastic nonadherent cell population. The study of these effects of TPA may allow us to gain insight into the mechanism of its tumor promoting activity and to use it as a tool to study the modulation of the immune system."

        "article_title": "Prostaglandin biosynthesis in the human fetal adrenal gland: regulation by glucocorticosteroids.",
        "abstract": "Human fetal adrenal (HFA) tissue was maintained in organ culture to evaluate the biosynthesis of prostaglandins and hormonal regulation of prostaglandin formation by this tissue. The HFA tissue secreted substantial amounts of prostaglandin E(2), prostaglandin F(2alpha), 13,14-dihydro-15-ketoprostaglandin F(2alpha), 6-ketoprostaglandin F(1alpha), and thromboxane B(2); secretion of prostaglandin D(2) could not be demonstrated. Prostaglandin biosynthesis in HFA tissue was inhibited in a time-dependent manner by corticotropin (ACTH; 0.4 muM); by the fourth day of culture, the extent of inhibition of biosynthesis of each prostaglandin was 60-90%. Progesterone (1 muM), cortisol (1 muM), and dexamethasone (1 muM) inhibited prostaglandin biosynthesis whereas estradiol (1 muM) did not. Of the compounds tested for inhibitory activity, dexamethasone was the most potent. An inhibitor of 11beta-hydroxylase activity (metyrapone; 0.1 mM) effectively eliminated the inhibition of prostaglandin biosynthesis caused by corticotropin and progesterone. Metyrapone treatment alone caused a 3-fold increase in prostaglandin biosynthesis by fetal adrenal tissues. Similar stimulatory effects resulted from treatment with inhibitors of (i) 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (cyanoketone; 15 muM), (ii) steroid 17alpha-hydroxylase (SU 10603; 19 muM), and (iii) cholesterol side-chain cleavage (aminoglutethimide; 1 mM). Inhibition of prostaglandin biosynthesis by dexamethasone in the presence or absence of metyrapone was concentration dependent and 50% inhibition could be demonstrated at 1 nM. A competitive inhibitor of the binding of glucocorticosteroids to cytoplasmic receptors (cortisol 21-mesylate; 1 muM) significantly reduced the inhibition of prostaglandin biosynthesis effected by dexamethasone (10 nM). These findings suggest that prostaglandin biosynthesis in the HFA gland is regulated by endogenously synthesized glucocorticosteroids, the actions of which are mediated by a glucocorticosteroid receptor. Such glucocorticosteroids induce the synthesis of a substance that inhibits prostaglandin biosynthesis."

        "abstract": "The alterations in lectin fluorescence stainings to the epidermis were examined in guinea pig skin treated with topical application of a 1% 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) solution plus long-wave ultraviolet (UVA) radiation (1.5-3.5 J/cm2) (PUVA). Serial biopsy specimens taken up to 21 days postirradiation were stained with 8 commercially available lectins labeled with either fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) or biotin (followed by avidin D-FITC): Bandeiraea simplicifolia agglutinin I (BSA), concanavalin A (Con-A), Dolichos biflorus agglutinin (DBA), peanut agglutinin (PNA), Ricinus communis agglutinin I (RCA), soybean agglutinin (SBA), Ulex europeus agglutinin I (UEA), and wheat germ agglutinin (WGA). In normal guinea pig skin UEA staining was absent. Following PUVA treatment, UEA and DBA stainings became apparent or stronger in intensity after days 7-14 (UEA) and days 4-7 (DBA), respectively, and returned to negative or weak by days 14-21. Stainings with Con-A, SBA, and WGA gave remarkable decreases in intensity after days 2-4 and recovered to the baseline by days 7-14. Intensity of BSA, PNA, and RCA stainings was decreased to a lesser degree than the other lectins. Such changes were not produced by application of 8-MOP, UVA radiation (less than 10 J/cm2), UVB radiation (900-2700 mJ/cm2), or tape stripping. These results suggest that PUVA treatment perturbs the composition or organization of epidermal cell surface glycoconjugates to induce alterations in lectin stainings."

The possible role of such a food factor in the regulation of sodium metabolism and in the causation of essential high blood pressure is discussed."

The mean mitotic indices were 1.22% in papillomas, 2.77% in grade I carcinomas, 8.2% in grade II carcinomas and 15.25% in grade III carcinomas. The nuclear volumes showed a gradual shift to larger values paralleling the histological degree. It is suggested that these objective parameters might be especially useful for the cytological assessment of exfoliated tumor cells."

        "abstract": "An intact cell assay system based on Tween-80 permeabilization was used to investigate ribonucleotide reductase activity in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Dithiothreitol, a reducing agent, is required for optimum activity. Analysis of dithiothreitol stimulation of CDP and ADP reductions indicated that in both cases the reducing agent served only to increase the reaction rate without altering the affinity of the enzyme for substrates. Magnesium chloride significantly stimulated the reduction of CDP but not ADP; this elevation in CDP reduction was due to an increase in both the affinity of the enzyme for substrate and the Vmax. In addition to ATP and dGTP, well-known activators of CDP and ADP reductase activities, it was found that dCTP and GTP were also able to activate CDP and ADP reductase activities, respectively. For the dCTP-activated reaction the Vmax was 0.158 nmol dCDP formed 5 X 10(6) cells-1 h-1 and the Km was 0.033 mM CDP, while for the GTP-activated reduction a Vmax of 0.667 nmol dADP formed 5 X 10(6) cells(-1) h-1 and Km of 0.20 mM ADP were observed. Kinetic analysis revealed that dCTP, dGTP, and GTP stimulate ribonucleotide reduction solely by increasing the affinity of the enzyme for substrate without affecting the Vmax of the respective reactions. ATP behaves in a different manner as it stimulates CDP reduction by altering both the affinity of the enzyme for substrate and the Vmax. Cellular concentrations of ribo- and deoxyribonucleoside di- and triphosphate pools were measured to help evaluate the relative physiological importance of the nucleotide activators. These determinations, along with the reaction kinetic studies, strongly imply that ATP is a much more important regulator of CDP reduction that dCTP, whereas GTP may serve as well or better than dGTP as the in vivo activator of ADP reduction."

        "abstract": "Food intake, body weight, body composition, resting metabolic rate (RMR) and the thermic effect of food (TEF) were measured in young rats, some of which were fed a high energy (HE) diet and some of which were forced to swim daily. In general, high energy feeding as compared to chow feeding, resulted in higher food intake, higher body weight, higher body fat, and a slightly lower TEF. In many cases, however, the specific effects varied with the age and sex of the animals. Animals forced to swim weighed less; were leaner; and had higher RMR and TEF than sedentary animals. The effects of exercise on energy balance were greatest in males, while the effects of the high energy diet on energy balance were greatest in females. All HE-fed rats were switched to lab chow at 104 days of age. Body weights of sedentary HE-fed rats returned to control levels but those of exercised HE-fed rats did not. Both HE-fed groups remained fatter than chow-fed controls, even two months after the diet switch."

The number of Alanders studied was 130. In a follow-up study 25 years later, 101 still living subjects from the original study could be traced. 17 of them had become hyperthyroid, 7 had been operated on for non-toxic goitre, and 4 had become hypothyroid. There was no correlation between thyroid hormone excretion values in 1956 and subsequent hyperthyroidism. Rheumatoid arthritis was overrepresented in the goitre group compared with the group without goitres, as well as compared with statistical figures on the frequency of rheumatic disease among the population in general of Aland and of Finland as a whole."

Funduscopic examination revealed disc swelling, tortuous veins and superficial retinal hemorrhages simulating early hyperviscosity syndrome. Clinical investigation and computerized tomography, however, indicated that an intracranial plasmacytoma was the cause of his papilledema. Cobalt 60 beam therapy and vincristine were added to his treatment regimen. Seven weeks later the intracranial tumour had almost totally disappeared. Symptomatic cerebral compression from an intracranial plasmacytoma associated with systemic disease is uncommon. The diagnosis and management are reviewed."

        "abstract": "One hundred and twenty six strains of streptococci isolated from the bloodstreams of 123 hospital in-patients--55 with endocarditis--and 255 strains isolated from the gingival crevices of 66 volunteers were characterised. Species isolated were Streptococcus mitior, S. sanguis, undifferentiated viridans streptococci, S. salivarius, S. milleri, S. mutans, S. bovis and S. faecalis. There was no significant difference between the distribution of species in blood and in the gingival crevice. S. mitior and S. sanguis were found less frequently in blood than their presence in the gingival crevice would have suggested, whereas S. milleri was found more frequently. This may indicate that S. milleri is more invasive or that it enters the bloodstream from sources other than the gingival crevice."

        "abstract": "Among the antibodies contained in a rabbit antiserum to synthetic peptide sequence TTHYGSLPQKAQGHRPQDEG (S82) of bovine myelin basic protein (residues 65-83 plus glycine), was a population reactive with a C-terminal determinant of S82 and cross-reactive with S79 (AQGHRPQDEG) but not S6 (AQGHRPQDENG). This antibody population was purified 153-fold by affinity chromatography from a minicolumn containing S79 coupled to CH-Sepharose 4B(TM) and eluted with 3 M MgCl2. The purified antibodies were then coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B(TM) and used to purify 125I-labelled, acylated S79 ([125I]S79), 3 M MgCl2 once again having been used to elute the labelled ligand. Sips distribution studies revealed appreciable heterogeneity of binding affinities of unpurified antibodies in their reaction with affinity-purified [125I]S79 or of purified antibodies in their reaction with unpurified [125I]S79 (heterogeneity constant a = 0.34 and 0.36, respectively). In contrast Sips distribution data indicated considerable restriction of binding of the purified antibodies in their reaction with purified labelled ligand (a = 0.92) with an average affinity constant of K0 = 1.56 X 10(8) M-1. The results indicate that the heterogeneous spectrum of binding affinities originally displayed by the unpurified S79-reactive antibodies in their reaction with unpurified labelled S79 was due both to the presence of some antibodies characterized by high affinity binding (K0 greater than 10(9) M-1) and of some labelled ligand with low binding affinity. The affinity chromatographic method as here described should prove advantageous in purifying and eventually characterizing picomolar amounts of serum factors, previously postulated to be fragments of myelin basic protein, that are reactive with reagent antibodies up to an affinity level of 10(8) M-1."

        "abstract": "The time course and orientation of attachment of Rhizobium trifolii 0403 to white clover root hairs was examined in slide cultures by light and electron microscopy. Inocula were grown for 5 days on defined BIII agar medium and represented the large subpopulation of fully encapsulated single cells which uniformly bind the clover lectin trifoliin A. When 10(7) cells or more were added per seedling, bacteria attached within minutes, forming randomly oriented clumps at the root hair tips. Several hours later, single cells attached polarly to the sides of the root hair. This sequence of attachment to clover root hairs was selective for R. trifolii at inoculum sizes of 10(7) to 4 X 10(8) per seedling, specifically inhibited if 2-deoxy-D-glucose, a hapten for trifoliin A, was present in the inoculum, and not observed when 4 X 10(8) cells were added to alfalfa seedling roots or to large clover root cell wall fragments which lacked trifoliin A but still had trifoliin A receptors. Once attached, R. trifolii 0403 became progressively less detachable with 2-deoxy-D-glucose. At smaller inoculum sizes (10(5) to 10(6) cells per seedling), there was no immediate clumping of R. trifolii at clover root hair tips, although polar binding of bacteria along the root hair surface was observed after 4 h. The interface between polarly attached bacteria and the root hair cell wall was shown to contain trifoliin A by immunofluorescence microscopy. Also, this interface was shown by transmission electron microscopy to contain electron-dense granules of host origin. Scanning electron microscopy revealed an accumulation of extracellular microfibrils associated with the lateral and polar surfaces of the attached bacteria, detectable after 12 h of incubation with seedling roots. At this same time, there was a significant reduction in the effectiveness of 2-deoxy-D-glucose in dislodging bacteria already attached to root hairs and an increase in firm attachment of bacteria to the root hair surface, which withstood the hydrodynamic shear forces of high-speed vortexing. These results are interpreted as a sequence of phases in attachment, beginning with specific reversible interactions between bacterial and plant surfaces (phase I attachment), followed by production of extracellular microfibrils which firmly anchor the bacterium to the root hair (phase 2 adhesion). Thus, attachment of R. trifolii to clover root hairs is a specific process requiring more than just the inherent adhesiveness of the bacteria to the plant cell wall.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

The records (using skin electrodes) included the electro-oculogram (EOG), the white light electroretinogram (ERG) during various stages of dark and light adaptation, and the flash and pattern reversal visual evoked potentials. Results obtained from the affected eye were compared with those from the healthy eye. The values of the healthy eye were not significantly different from our normal control group. The EOGs of the affected eyes were not significantly different from those of the healthy eyes. The 'a' wave of the ERG during light adaptation was significantly (P less than 0.05) smaller in the affected eye. The amplitudes of the other components and the latencies of all components were not affected. The latency of the PR-VEP of the affected eye in all subjects was prolonged in comparison with the unaffected eye. In 3 subjects the latency was prolonged by more than 2 S.D.s compared with our control group. The amplitude of the PR-VEP in 5 of our 6 subjects was slightly but significantly (P less than 0.02) smaller in the affected eye. There was no correlation between amplitude and latency changes."

The splenomegaly-inducing ability of phase I cells was reduced upon incubation with phase I but not with phase II antiserum, whereas the phase II cells preincubated with phase I or phase II immune sera induced higher splenomegaly than the phase II cells alone. Phase I cells caused lower splenomegaly in mice previously immunized with C.b. The splenomegaly-inducing ability of phase I cells was abolished by mild acid hydrolysis, by treatment either with phenol-chloroform-petroleum ether (PCP) or with a chloroform-methanol (CM) mixture.

        "abstract": "A 57-year-old woman presented with a ptosis of her left eye four weeks prior to surgery for scirrhous carcinoma of the breast. Six months later she had blurred vision in her left eye, and double vision occurred three months subsequently. The diagnosis was enophthalmus and ophthalmoplegia. The suspected diagnosis of a distant metastasis of the scirrhous carcinoma of the breast was confirmed by biopsy. The orbital symptoms were a rare first sign not only of a metastatic process, but also of the carcinoma itself."

        "abstract": "Cleavage products resulting from DNase I treatment of adenoviral nucleoprotein were examined by gel electrophoresis, Southern blotting and hybridization to cloned restriction fragments derived from various regions of the viral genome. DNase I produced specific double-stranded cleavages in DNA of purified adenoviral cores and in DNA of intranuclear viral chromatin at early and late times of infection. At least some of these sites were also cleaved by DNase I in purified viral DNA, showing that sequence specificity of DNase I cleavage may contribute to the observation of specific double-stranded DNase I cleavage sites in adenoviral nucleoprotein. In addition, sites were observed which were specific either for cores or for intranuclear chromatin. In contrast to many cellular genes which have been characterized, there was no obvious relationship between DNase I cleavage sites and other features of the viral genome such as promoters or polyadenylation sites."

Mice sustaining a chronic infection of 5 months duration failed to develop a DTH to treponemal antigens, whereas priming by a single intravenous injection with killed organisms resulted in a significant DTH response in mice when challenged 5 days later. Treatment of mice prior to priming with a single sublethal dose of cyclophosphamide (100 mg/kg body weight) not only failed to potentiate T. pallidum-DTH, but abrogated the response observed in untreated primed animals."

After inoculation of 400 spleen focus-forming units of Friend leukaemia virus (FLV), a significant number of mice yielded MCMV in salivary glands and kidneys 4 to 5 weeks later. Administration of cyclophosphamide during FLV infection increased the percentage of MCMV-positive animals. These results suggest that cytomegalovirus infections in leukaemic patients may reactivate as a result of the leukaemia itself and may be exacerbated by chemotherapy."

There exists a simple conditional method, making no assumptions about the family-size distribution, that is always preferable to the assumption of any particular distributional form. Furthermore, the simplicity of the conditional method gives insights into properties of estimates of genetic and ascertainment parameters, which are not available when a particular form for the family-size distribution is assumed."

        "abstract": "The binding kinetics of human monomeric IgG and stable heat-aggregated IgG (A-IgG) to Fc receptors of hepatocytes and Kupffer cells isolated from mice was studied. After injection of radiolabelled proteins the 60-70% of hepatic uptake was recovered in parenchymal cells (hepatocytes). In experiments in vitro the A-IgG bound in larger amounts to hepatocytes and Kupffer cells than monomeric IgG. The association rate constants of aggregates were somewhat higher for Kupffer cells than for hepatocytes whereas the percentage uptake of aggregates by Kupffer cells was only 5-15% of that of hepatocytes. The equilibrium constants of aggregates binding to both cells amounted to 0.4-1 X 10(8) M-1 for A-IgG compared with an equilibrium constant for monomeric IgG of 1-2 X 10(7)M-1. The maximum number of IgG and A-IgG molecules bound per cell was higher on hepatocytes (mean 14 X 10(6)) than on Kupffer cells (mean 2 X 10(5)) which is in agreement with the higher binding capacity of hepatocytes for these proteins observed in vivo and in vitro experiments. The ability to compete for receptor binding seemed to reside exclusively in the Fc portion of IgG since F(ab')2 fragments of IgG failed to inhibit labelled monomeric IgG or A-IgG. The receptor seems to be specific for IgG since unlabelled monomeric IgA demonstrated no binding inhibition of labelled IgG or A-IgG on hepatocytes and Kupffer cells. The overall results further suggest that hepatocytes might through Fc receptors play a collaborative role with the mononuclear phagocytic system in the clearance of circulating immune complexes."

        "abstract": "By using the antigenic structure of lysozyme determined in this laboratory and the X-ray co-ordinates we have calculated the closest-atom distances between each of the residues in the three antigenic sites and all the other amino acids of the lysozyme molecule. These calculations enabled us to identify the nearest neighbours to each of the site residues. Thus the immediate environment of each site residue is described. For the three antigenic sites there is a total of 71 neighbouring residues. The effects of evolutionary amino acid substitutions in site-neighbouring residues on the binding capacity of protein binding sites in general and on protein antigenic sites in particular are discussed. These, together with the direct replacements in site residues, will acount for the major effects. However, the limitations of this treatment are stressed. The smaller effects on antigenic sites of replacements at once-removed and even at more distant locations, which, when they become cumulative, could be considerable, are brought to attention, together with any influences of conformational readjustments that can take place as a result of evolutionary amino acid replacements."

        "abstract": "The behavioural effects of varying amounts of alcohol exposure in utero were studied using a longitudinal prospective design. An unselected sample of 1529 pregnant women was interviewed in the fifth month of pregnancy regarding beverage consumption, diet, drug use, and socioeconomic background; a cohort of approximately 500 infants was selected at delivery for follow-up. Lengthy individual behavioural and anthropometric examinations were made of the children between birth and four years of age. Alcohol-related behavioural effects are still statistically significant at four years, as they were at birth and eight months, even after adjustment for variables such as maternal smoking, drug use and diet, education, birth order and family stress. Habituation, sucking pressure and latency to suck are some of the behaviours most affected on days 1 and 2, while reaction time, attention and response latency are most affected at four years. Thus alcohol exposure in utero appears to affect the speed and accuracy of information-processing in the offspring. The findings support a dose-response rather than a threshold effect on most of these behavioural outcomes. However, increased risk of a clinically suspect or abnormal child occurs only at the heavier drinking levels. Examination of the cohort of 500 children at seven years of age is under way."

However, if the cats before the induction of bacteremia were given 80 mM HCl and 0.6 ml gallbladder bile/kg b.w. microscopic mucosal damage developed regularly in the corpus-fundus area of the stomach. The gastric mucosal damage was not associated with significant decrease of total gastric blood flow as measured continuously electromagnetically or decreased gastric mucosal blood flow measured early and late during sepsis using radioactively labelled microspheres. Neither was the development of gastric mucosal damage associated with reduced gastric wall collagen concentration nor in RNA, DNA concentrations or RNA/DNA ratio in the gastric mucosa."

        "abstract": "The true incidence of the lupus syndrome induced by hydralazine was determined in a longitudinal study of 281 patients consecutively starting hydralazine for hypertension over a 51 month period. Data on the duration of treatment and the maximum dose achieved were examined using life table analysis. After three years' treatment with hydralazine the incidence of the lupus syndrome was 6.7% (95% confidence limits 3.2-10.2%). The incidence was dose dependent, with no cases recorded in patients taking 50 mg daily and incidences of 5.4% with 100 mg daily and of 10.4% with 200 mg daily. The incidence was higher in women (11.6%) than in men (2.8%). In women taking 200 mg daily the three year incidence was 19.4%. Hydralazine is an effective antihypertensive drug that has come to be used in restricted dosage (not more than 200 mg daily) because of its risk of inducing the lupus syndrome. This study shows that the true incidence of the syndrome is still unacceptably high even when the drug is prescribed according to current recommendations."

In normal subjects, the results are similar whatever the assays are used. In uremic patients, the half-life for the terminal phase increased with renal failure with the microbioassay, but it is demonstrated that deacetyl cefotaxime has only a prolonged half - life with a more specific assay = HPLC method. After repetitive doses, the tendency for accumulation was only noted in patients with very severe renal failure (creatinine clearance less than 5 ml.min-1)."

        "abstract": "It is speculated that oxidative stress in vivo may have some influence on advanced, nonenzymatic, glycosylation end products. However, this has not been demonstrated yet. We assessed changes in collagen-linked fluorescence in the skin of nondiabetic and streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats fed three different diets for 4 weeks that could modify oxidative stress: vitamin E-deficient (D), vitamin E-supplemented (S), and control (C). The serum lipid peroxide level expressed as thiobarbituric acid (TBA) activity in diabetic rats on the S diet (9.6 +/- 1.0 [SE] nmol/L/mL) was significantly (P less than .01) lower than that in rats on the D diet (111.4 +/- 22.4), and similar to that in nondiabetic rats on the C diet (12.4 +/- 2.2). The collagen-linked fluorescence level was significantly (P less than .01) higher in diabetic rats than in nondiabetic rats, which corresponded to the serum glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin levels. However, there were no significant differences in the fluorescence levels among three groups classified by three different diets in both nondiabetic and diabetic rats (21.7 +/- 1.7 arbitrary U/mg collagen for D, 22.3 +/- 2.0 for C, and 22.8 +/- 2.5 for S in nondiabetic rats v 41.2 +/- 4.1 for D, 40.1 +/- 4.7 for C, and 39.3 +/- 3.5 for S in diabetic rats), despite significant changes in serum lipid peroxide levels. Consequently, there were no significant changes found in collagen-linked fluorescence levels in diabetic rats wherein oxidative stress was modified by vitamin E deficiency and supplementation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Mice treated with 0.5 microgram danazol for 5 weeks during 4-9 weeks of age and killed at 21 weeks of age showed significantly lower incidence of the spontaneous development of adenomyosis than the age-matched intact control mice. The inhibitory effects of danazol were also evident in mice bearing pituitary isografts which were effective in inducing an early and a high incidence of adenomyosis. Furthermore, the treatment with danazol resulted in the decrease of serum levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and prolactin (PRL) associated with hypofunction of ovaries and persistent diestrus. These results support the usefulness of danazol for the clinical treatment of gynecological disorders except for hypofunction of ovaries."

        "abstract": "Electron microscopy has been used to show that Mycoplasma dispar produces an external capsulelike material in vivo that has an affinity for both ruthenium red and polycationic ferritin. This extracellular material is lost upon passage in culture medium but can be regained with a single passage on bovine lung fibroblast (BLF) cells. To confirm that the extracellular material associated with cell-grown mycoplasmas was the same as that observed in infected calves, rabbit antibodies were produced to purified capsulelike material isolated by protease digestion of cell-grown organisms. These antibodies bound to capsulelike material on the surface of M. dispar cells colonizing the bronchial epithelium of infected calves and to capsulelike material from cell-grown mycoplasmas. Calves infected with M. dispar produced antibodies in lung secretions that were capable of binding to the purified capsulelike material. The Fab fragments of rabbit antibodies to in vitro-produced capsulelike material could block this binding, indicating that the capsulelike material was similar in both in vivo-grown and cell-grown organisms. The carbohydrate nature of the capsular material suggested by the ruthenium red and polycationic staining characteristics was confirmed by its binding to Ricinus communis agglutinin, a galactose-specific lectin. These studies confirm that capsule material produced during infections with M. dispar share antigenic determinants with the material produced under in vitro conditions and that association with mammalian cells induces production of this material."

        "abstract": "We have previously observed 3- to 10-fold increases in pituitary LH beta-subunit mRNA levels in the rat 28 days after castration. These changes correlate with increases in percentages and areas of cells that bear the LH beta mRNA and with the amount of label for mRNA per cell. In contrast, FSH beta mRNA levels increase 2.5- to 4-fold 7-14 days after castration, decline to near-intact levels 28 days postcastration, and rise 4.5-fold by 96 days postcastration. The purpose of this study was to determine morphological correlates of these changes in FSH beta mRNA levels. Dispersed pituitary cells from intact and castrated rats were analyzed for FSH beta and LH beta mRNAs and protein by in situ hybridization techniques and immunocytochemistry, respectively. In intact animals over 79% of pituitary cells labeled for FSH beta mRNA were small (area less than 150 microns 2). However, 7 days after castration, the average area of labeled cells increased 4-fold (80% were over 200 microns 2 in area), without a significant change in percentages of FSH beta mRNA-containing cells. The amount of mRNA per cell (as measured by area of label per cell) increased 6-fold. Fourteen days after castration, the average area of cells containing FSH beta mRNA decreased to 2 times that in intact rats (48% were greater than 200 microns 2). The percentage of labeled cells increased from 11% (intact) to 20%. Furthermore, the dual labeling studies showed that 37% of these FSH cells were monohormonal (detected by FSH beta mRNA, but not LH beta antigen) compared with 23% in intact rats. At this same time, the FSH cells exhibited a decrease in the amount of mRNA per cell. In 21- to 84-day castrates, average areas of FSH beta mRNA remained at 2-2.5 times the areas of cells from intact rats. In addition, 21 days after surgery the percentages of labeled cells and amount of FSH beta mRNA per cell declined to those in intact rats. A greater proportion was multihormonal (only 15% expressed FSH beta mRNA but not LH beta antigens). At 84 days there were 2-fold increases in the percentages of labeled cells and the density of label, which correlate with the recovery in mRNA levels assayed at 96 days. Thus, factors that contribute to the early rise in FSH beta mRNA include increases in the amount of mRNA per cell, which coincides with increased cell area.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

        "abstract": "The two satellite RNAs associated with CYMV infections were sequenced. The larger (sCYMV-L1) has only linear molecules 1145 nucleotides long, a poly(A) tail, a long open reading frame (ORF) coding for a protein of Mr 39,636 resembling in composition those of other large nepovirus satellite RNAs, a 5' leader sequence of 16 nucleotides and a 3' non-coding region of 40 nucleotides. In vitro translation of sCYMV-L1 yielded a protein product with a size that corresponded to that predicted from the sequence. The smaller satellite (sCYMV-S1) is 457 nucleotides long, has no ORF of significant length and no in vitro messenger activity. Both linear and circular forms of this satellite RNA were detected in infected tissues. Comparison of the sCYMV-S1 primary structure with the sequences of other small nepoviral satellites reveals large regions of homology. Analysis of the secondary structures derived from the sequences of the plus and minus strands suggests possible consensus sequences for their self-cleavage."

The treatment was started with 4 cycles of chemotherapy with combination of adriamycin, vincristine, 5-fluorouracil and cyclophosphamide. This was followed by high-energy radiotherapy (45 Gy to the breast and lymphatic areas), with or without surgery. After radiotherapy, the response rate was 76%: 39/51 (complete response 39%: 20/51). Twenty-nine patients (57%) were treated conservatively (20 treated by radiotherapy alone and 9 treated by tumorectomy with axillary dissection followed by interstitial implantation). For 22 patients (43%), the mastectomy with axillary dissection was necessary. The three year overall survival rate and disease free survival rate were 88, and 86%. Local recurrences occurred in one patient (2%). The toxicity with this combined treatment regime was low. The cosmetic results were acceptable when a conservative treatment was proposed."

        "abstract": "Effects of Sr substitution for Ca on the contractions due to Ca influx in the aortae of rabbit and rat and the guinea-pig taenia coli were examined in order to characterize the pathways of Ca influx activated by either high K or receptor agonists. In normal solution containing Ca, high K increased both muscle tension and 45Ca uptake in rabbit and rat aortae and guinea-pig taenia. In Sr-substituted solution, high K also induced contractions accompanied by the increases in 89Sr uptake. Noradrenaline induced sustained contraction and increase in 45Ca uptake in normal solution whereas it induced only small contraction accompanied by small increase in 89Sr uptake in Sr-substituted solution in the aortae. Histamine increased neither muscle tension nor 89Sr uptake in Sr-substituted solution although it increased muscle tension as well as 45Ca uptake in normal solution in taenia. Ca and Sr both induced contraction in saponin-treated smooth muscles. The concentration of Sr to induce half maximum contraction was approximately 20 times higher than that for Ca in rabbit and rat aortae or 62 times higher in guinea-pig taenia. From these results, it is suggested that Ca and Sr enter the smooth muscle cells through K-activated channels and induce contraction whereas noradrenaline- or histamine-activated channels are less permeable to Sr than to Ca."

        "abstract": "There are multiple difficulties in evaluating new treatments for multiple sclerosis (MS). The clinical diagnosis is imprecise, and the correlation between lesion and clinical dysfunction is incomplete. The neurologic evaluation is complex and lacks full precision. The course of MS is complex and has limited predictability. There is no laboratory test that can be accepted now as compensating for the defects in diagnosis, lesion-symptom correlation, course, and neurologic evaluation. Because of these problems, which appear inherent in MS, there are limitations to the statistical methods that can be properly applied to trials of therapy. Most trials of definitive nature will require a random design. When improvement is seen in a trial of therapy, there may be difficulty in determining the mechanism."

        "abstract": "Seventeen strains of Spirillum-like organisms (2) were isolated from the Parana Delta and other rivers (Table 1), using the following medium: 0.5% malic acid; 0.4% KOH; 0.5% K2HPO4; 0.005% yeast extract; pH was adjusted to 7 with KOH and 0.15% agar. The organisms produced a white, dense and sub-superficial pellicle in this medium, and streaking them on plates, single colonies could be isolated. They were easily recognized thanks to the Congo red added to the medium, because the bacteria, as it happens with Azospirillum species (6) (Spirillum lipoferum) (1), concentrated the strain. Using a colorimetric determination for ethylene (5), nitrogenase activity was detected in all the strains and in the NFb and potato-agar media the colonies were typical of Azospirillum (3). In PSS-semisolid and solid media, the growth was similar to that observed with Azospirillum strains. The isolated organisms developed in this medium better at 28 degrees C than at 37 degrees C, and the same was observed with 8 strains of Azospirillum isolated from plan roots of different species obtained from temperate regions. Some physiological tests were performed to identify the isolated organisms (Table 2). None of the isolated strains could be classified as a known species of Spirillum (4, 7), according to these tests. As thirteen strains showed properties in common with the terrestrial species A. brasilense and the others with A. lipoferum (8) they were tentatively identified as members of these species. Further studies are needed to ensure the classification of these strains and to determine the importance of these bacteria in the nitrogen balance of the waters from where they were isolated."

Twenty two of these patients died from this cancer during a follow-up of 13--18 years. Five of them had initially had distant metastases. Of the remainder seven had had no thyroid operation or only a biopsy, nine an operable tumour that invaded through the thyroid capsule (extrathyroid) and only one a primary tumour confined to the thyroid (intrathyroid). The mortality rates were: 83% for patients with distant metastases, 47% for patients with no thyroid operation, 28% for patients with extrathyroid tumours, and 4% for patients with intrathyroid tumours. Death from an intrathyroid or occult papillary carcinoma that does not show initial distant metastases seems to be exceptional, also if the thyroid operation has been unilateral."

Most had vascular and neurological abnormalities. Clinical findings and electrophysiological tests for autonomic dysfunction had the highest yield of abnormal results. Nerve conduction studies and pudendal nerve somatosensory evoked potentials were far less informative. The lack of correlation between vascular and general neurological abnormalities emphasises that patients must be screened for both vascular and neurological dysfunction to prevent unrewarding vascular operation in impotent men."

        "abstract": "The study of the distribution law of human peripheral blood cultures for the sensitivity to thiophosphamide was performed. In the first experiment the blood from one person was used, in the second one the blood was used from different persons. \"The percent of aberrant cells\" and \"the number of chromosome breaks per 100 cells\" were scored. The distribution law of the cultures in all the experiments was found to be normal. Analysis of the variances on the percent of aberrant cells showed that the distribution law of the cultures received from one donor corresponded to the binomial one, and that of the cultures received from different donors--to the Poisson's one."

        "abstract": "The antigenic domains of histone 5 (H5), a highly conserved variant of histone 1 (H1), were studied in relation to their reactivity with autoantibodies found in the sera of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and drug-induced lupus (DIL). While some H5 antibodies cross-react with H1, adsorption and immunoblotting studies have identified H5-specific antibodies as well. After proteolytic cleavage of H5 peptides, the reactivity of sera from these patients was tested by Western immunoblotting. All SLE (9/9) and DIL (7/7) sera bound an antigenic determinant in the carboxyl (C) terminus of H5 while none of the sera bound to the amino (N) terminus or the central hydrophobic domain. Although the reactivity of DIL sera with the purified H5 peptides was weaker than that of SLE sera, the antigenic domains bound by both groups of sera were the same. These observations demonstrate that the H5 domains reacting with DIL sera are restricted to the carboxyl terminus and are therefore no less restricted than those reacting with SLE sera. Further, the potential epitopes in the carboxyl terminus of H5 do not have a high degree of sequence identity with known mammalian peptides."

        "abstract": "When an employee goes over the manager's head to the manager's superior, a high degree of anxiety is often created for all three persons involved. The manager's ability carefully to assess the situation, to evaluate the dynamics present, and to respond deliberatively will be crucial to his or her effectiveness in handling the situation. Managers can view managing the manipulative employee as both a challenge and an opportunity. The manager who is able to respond effectively to the complex, interpersonal phenomenon of manipulation will gain not only self-confidence but the respect of colleagues."

        "abstract": "The notion that tumour-cell-derived IL-2 might lead to paracrine stimulation of the host anti-tumour response was tested in a transplantable rat sarcoma model. Three HSNLV clones induced to secrete different amounts of human IL-2 following retroviral gene transfer showed reduced tumorigenicity and metastatic potential in athymic (nu/nu) and immunocompetent syngeneic rats which was directly related to the level of IL-2 secretion. In contrast, the tumorigenicity of HSNLV clones secreting a biologically inactive form of IL-2 (IL-2Lys20) was unaltered. T-lymphocyte-mediated rejection of ZipI, the highest IL-2 producer, was demonstrated histologically in hooded rats and infiltrating mononuclear cells were also observed in ZipI tumours growing in athymic rats. Tumours derived from IL-2-secreting HSNLV showed reduced or absent IL-2 secretion in immunocompetent rats, sometimes with associated loss of the IL-2 provirus, but continued to secrete IL-2 in nude rats. The host response to Moloney-helper-virus-infected HSNLV was also examined and the results represent a cautionary note to those undertaking experiments of a similar nature."

Both drugs induced a decrease in lymphocyte suppressive T activity which recovered after 4 days and tended to be larger, although not significantly, with thiopental. Serum noradrenaline concentration significantly increased after two hours of propofol anesthesia and after 20 min and 2 hours of thiopental administration. These results demonstrate that the relationship between lymphocyte suppressive T activity and noradrenaline corresponds theoretically to anesthesia deepness."

        "abstract": "The stability of 5-aminosalicylic acid and its metabolites has been investigated when stored frozen. N-beta-D-Glucopyranosyl-5-aminosalicylic acid was formed in considerable amounts concomitant with a decrease in 5-aminosalicylic acid in plasma samples spiked with 5-aminosalicylic acid as well as in standard solutions of 5-aminosalicylic acid buffered with potassium phosphate between pH 5.5 and pH 8.0 with 4.0 mM glucose added and stored at -20 degrees C. Thus N-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-5-aminosalicylic acid might not, as previously described, be a metabolite of 5-aminosalicylic acid but an artifact formed during storage of plasma samples. The N-glucoside formed could be quantitatively degraded to 5-aminosalicylic acid and glucose by adding 0.2 M potassium phosphate buffer pH 3.0 to the sample prior to the analysis. The metabolites of 5-aminosalicylic acid (N-formyl-5-aminosalicylic acid, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid and N-butyryl-5-aminosalicylic acid) were found to be stable in plasma stored at -20 degrees C for at least eight months."

Three patients from the authors' files are found with myelofibrosis and bone marrow lymphocytosis after treatment for HD. Although somewhat unusual, the clinical impression initially was, in each case, isolated recurrence of HD involving the bone marrow, 6 to 11 years after initial diagnosis. In each case, after single or multiple marrow aspirates and biopsies were done, the differential between HD involving the marrow and myelodysplasia with myelofibrosis and lymphocytic infiltrates was made. The absence of diagnostic Reed-Sternberg (RS) cells was useful in diagnosing the latter. All three patients died of causes related to cytopenias, with two having progressed to overt acute nonlymphocytic leukemia. Myelofibrosis with lymphocytic infiltrates in the marrow, without diagnostic RS cells, in patients' status after treatment for HD, should alert one to the possibility of myelodysplasia."

        "abstract": "Cervical spinal stenosis is radiologically defined by a reduced inner diameter (X less than 13 mm) of the cord canal and in most cases etiologically connected with spondylosis. The following study describes the results of non-invasive assessment of the long ascending and descending spinal tracts in 12 patients. The long ascending spinal tracts were examined by spinal and cortical SEP after stimulation of the tibial nerve; for the assessment of the descending spinal tracts motor responses of the tibial anterior muscle were recorded after non-invasive stimulation of the motor cortex. Clinically symptomatic patients (N = 2) exhibited clear-cut functional motor and sensory deficits of the central pathways. In asymptomatic patients (N = 10) corticomotoneuronal latencies to the lower limbs were increased in 8 cases. In comparison, increased central sensory latencies were found in 9/10. In conclusion, the studies showed that the technique of non-invasive stimulation of the motor cortex may play a role in the detection of subclinical lesions of the long descending motor tracts due to a chronic mechanical irritation."

        "abstract": "Several intracellular proteins of low and intermediate molecular weights have been isolated from a variety of mammalian and plant tissues that possess an ability to catalyze the transfer or exchange of intact phospholipid molecules between different membrane systems. The soluble cytosolic fraction of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae also contains phospholipid transfer activity that varies with both the state of cellular growth and the type of metabolic carbon source. This activity is protein in nature and very unstable, and requires powerful separation techniques for its purification. Here we report the isolation and characterization of two phospholipid transfer proteins from yeast, one of which we believe represents a partial proteolytic product of the other. The two proteins were purified to near homogeneity through a combination of dye-ligand and high performance ion-exchange chromatographic techniques. Transfer protein I (TP-I) is eluted at a lower ionic strength from an anion-exchange column than transfer protein II (TP-II), which reflects the difference in their isoelectric points; TP-I has a pI of 6.3, while that for TP-II is 6.1. Both species have the same apparent molecular weight of 33,400 and virtually identical substrate specificities. The order of the relative rates of phospholipid transfer are phosphatidylcholine greater than phosphatidylethanolamine greater than phosphatidylinositol greater than phosphatidylserine."

        "abstract": "The accumulation and disposition of the non-steroidal antiinflammatory drug isoxicam were investigated following its oral administration to 6 subjects with normal renal function and 13 patients with diminished renal function. Isoxicam was given daily as a single oral dose for 14-15 consecutive days. Steady-state plasma levels were achieved after 13 days. The effect of differences in renal function on the kinetics of isoxicam appeared to be minimal. Accumulation of isoxicam was similar in both groups of subjects and there was no significant difference between the groups in the plasma clearance or terminal half-life of isoxicam. There were substantial differences between individuals in the apparent plasma clearance and half-life of the drug, and this is reflected in the 7-fold range of steady-state plasma isoxicam concentrations encountered in the subjects."

On the basis of this structure the author has identified four groups of children differing in the severity of primary disturbances, gravity of mental disorders, and forms of hypercompensation. The proposed typology may be useful for gaining better understanding into the regularities of early childhood autism and for further differentiation of a psychocorrective approach."

An increase of nerve cells in the stratum moleculare, which is qualitatively observed in primary generalized epilepsy, is thought to be an indicator for slight maldevelopment. In this morphometric study, the neuron density of layer I in the frontal lobe in primary generalized epilepsy is measured. Compared with age-matched controls, the neuron density in primary generalized epilepsy is significantly increased. Thus, neuron density could be a significant index for the disturbance of regional maturation of the cortex."

        "abstract": "Light- and urethane-induced retinopathies in rats are characterized by loss of photoreceptors. Retinal capillaries subsequently become incorporated into the normally avascular retinal pigment epithelium. These models provided an opportunity to study the response of epithelial cells to closely apposed capillaries, in order to determine if capillaries contribute to the polar organization of epithelial cells. Pigment epithelial cells reorganized their lateral plasma membrane where the latter faced intraepithelial capillaries. This normally flat, undifferentiated membrane developed attachment sites, folds and intracytoplasmic tubules, and exhibited endocytosis and putative basal lamina secretion. These structural and functional specializations are normally restricted to the basal plasma membrane - the normal vascular front of the cell facing the dense meshwork of capillaries constituting the choriocapillaris. We conclude that RPE cells, and perhaps epithelia in general, polarize in response to an adjacent capillary bed."

        "abstract": "A RIA method is described for the measurement of dexamethasone in maternal, cord, and neonate plasma in a collaborative multicenter clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of antenatal steroid therapy in the prevention of respiratory distress syndrome. The antiserum raised against dexamethasone-3-carboxymethyloxime-BSA conjugate was highly specific in that the endogenous steroids and 11-dehydrodexamethasone, a metabolite of dexamethasone, had a cross-reaction of less than 2.0%. Both pregnancy and cord plasma had to be purified by either gel filtration and/or paper chromatography. The overall recoveries of dexamethasone were 75.3 +/- 6.7% and 48.9 +/-6.7% for maternal and cord plasma samples, respectively. The intra- and interassay coefficients of variance for maternal plasma were 8.4% ad 9.1%, respectively, and for cord plasma were 11.9% and 10.9%, respectively. There was a good correlation between the dexamethasone values obtained by RIA when compared with those obtained by performance liquid chromatography in some cord plasma specimens. The recoveries of added dexamethasone and its metabolite by high performance liquid chromatography were also found to be good. The average maternal plasma dexamethasone level was 37 ng/ml 2 h after im injections of 5 mg dexamethasone phosphate every 12 h. The half-life of dexamethasone measured after the discontinuation of the drug was 216 min. Dexamethasone appeared too be cleared very rapidly from the circulation of the fetus and neonate. Because 11-dehydrodexamethasone was not present in significant amounts in the neonate, it was concluded that other factors in addition to the conversion of dexamethasone to its 11 dehydro metabolite were responsible for the rapid clearance of dexamethasone from fetal and neonatal circulation."

        "abstract": "The effects of 3,4-diaminopyridine (3,4-DAP) on isolated sympathetic ganglia were studied by means of intracellular and extracellular recording techniques. 3,4-DAP in micromolar concentrations caused a single orthodromic stimulus to generate a brief burst of repetitive postganglionic discharges. Such stimulus-bound repetition (SBR) appeared to represent a presynaptic action of 3,4-DAP, as no repetitive firing could be evoked by antidromic or direct stimulation of ganglion cells. 3,4-DAP also increased the latency to the onset of the synaptic potential at concentrations paralleling those responsible for SBR. The actions of 3,4-DAP on synaptic transmission extended over a 10,000-fold concentration range, beginning with synaptic facilitation at micromolar concentrations (1-500 microM), and proceeding to depressant effects at millimolar concentrations (0.5-10 mM). The postganglionic repetitive discharges (SBR) induced by 3,4-DAP could be selectively suppressed by D-tubocurarine (D-Tc) or tetraethylammonium (TEA), at concentrations of these antagonists below those required to block transmission. 3,4-DAP had significant anti-curare effects, producing a four-fold shift of the D-Tc concentration-effect curve for transmission block. In contrast, 3,4-DAP neither antagonized nor enhanced the transmission block produced by TEA. These results are incompatible with traditional concepts of ganglionic blockade by D-Tc and TEA, and suggest the possibility of presynaptic sites of action in ganglion block."

        "abstract": "Routine examination of the renal papilla with a stereomicroscope in 372 autopsies revealed a number of unexpected findings, including linear scarring of the papilla and marked vascular dilation of papillary vessels in black patients with sickle hemoglobinopathies, the presence of small tumors, and the rarity of papillary necrosis of the type seen in analgesic abuse. Stereomicroscopy also allows accurate documentation of the pattern and frequency of calcium deposition on the surface of the papilla (54.03 per cent of cases) and the incidence of early and well-formed calculi (8.06 per cent). Use of the stereomicroscope once again proved to be of inestimable value in routine autopsy service."

When serum calcium levels were corrected for albuminemia, the incidence of hypo- and hypercalcemia was respectively 10.8% and 10.1%. Hypophosphatemia was found in 29.7% patients, hyperphosphatemia in 2.5%. The incidence was slightly different in presence of bone metastases. Hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia prevailed in osteoblastic metastases and hypercalcemia in osteolytic metastases. The incidence of hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia in malignancy was therefore surprisingly high, even apart from the presence of bone metastases. Both hypo- and hypercalcemia were associated with elevated serum alkaline phosphatase levels. Moreover, a calcium-phosphorus product reduction was observed in osteoblastic metastases, suggesting a condition of secondary hyperparathyroidism."

        "abstract": "Membrane vesicles shed from intact A-431 epidermoid carcinoma cells and harvested in the presence of Ca2+ contained epidermal-growth-factor (EGF) receptor/kinase substrates of apparent molecular masses 185, 85, 70, 55, 38 and 27 kDa. The 38 kDa substrate (p38) was recognized by an antibody that had been raised against the human placental EGF receptor/kinase substrate calpactin II (lipocortin I). The A-431 and placental substrates, isolated by immunoprecipitation after phosphorylation in situ, yielded identical phosphopeptide maps upon limited proteolytic digestion with each of five different enzymes. The A-431-cell vesicular p38 is therefore calpactin II. EGF treatment of the intact A-431 cells before inducing vesiculation was not necessary for the substrate to be present within the vesicles. Our data thus indicate that receptor internalization is not a prerequisite for receptor-mediated phosphorylation of calpactin II. The ability of the protein to function as a substrate for the receptor/kinase depended upon the continued presence of Ca2+ during the vesicle-isolation procedure. EGF-stimulated phosphorylation of calpactin II was much less pronounced in vesicles prepared from A-431 cells in the absence of Ca2+, although comparable amounts of the protein were detectable by immunoblotting. Calpactin II therefore appears to be sequestered in a Ca2+-modulated manner within shed vesicles, along with at least four other major targets for the EGF receptor/kinase. The vesicle preparation may be a useful model system in which to study the phosphorylation and function of potentially important membrane-associated substrates for the receptor."

The intensity of chemiluminescence greatly varied, which was not linked with specific antigenic and structural features of peptidoglycans. The maximal chemiluminescence was induced by S. aureus and S. cohnii peptidoglycans and the minimal chemiluminescence, by S. lentus and S. epidermidis peptidoglycans. The data obtained in experiments on cross restimulation with homologous and heterologous peptidoglycans suggest that the mechanisms of neutrophil activation are similar in character, differing from the mechanism of latex-induced chemiluminescence. These data were analyzed from the viewpoint of the heterogeneity of bacterial peptidoglycans and its effect on their relationship with neutrophils."

        "abstract": "The purpose of these studies was to characterize the effect of the new fluoropyrimidine nucleoside 5'-deoxy-5-fluorouridine (5'dFUrd) on macromolecular processes in correlation with its cytotoxicity in Ehrlich ascites tumor cells. Following a 2-h exposure, 5'-dFUrd exhibited an LD50 (as determined by clonogenicity) of 48 microM. In cells supplemented with 10 microM dThd, the LD50 for 5'-dFUrd increased to 660 microM. DNA synthesis was markedly and rapidly suppressed by all cytotoxic concentrations of 5'-dFUrd. There was no apparent direct measurable effect of 5'-dFUrd on either RNA or protein synthesis, although both were suppressed 24 h after the drug exposure. Thymidylate synthetase activity was completely inhibited by all cytotoxic concentrations of 5'-dFUrd. FUra incorporation into RNA was also measured and appeared to correlate with the dThd-nonreversible toxicity of 5'-dFUrd. These studies indicate that the mechanism of 5'-dFUrd cytotoxicity is directly analogous to that reported for 5-fluorouracil. The inhibition of thymidylate synthetase leading to an inhibition of DNA synthesis was the most potent cytotoxic mechanism (i.e., dThd-reversible) for 5'-dFUrd, and was found to be highly time-dependent. Higher concentrations of 5'-dFUrd resulted in dThd-nonreversible toxicity, which appeared to be related to the incorporation of FUra into RNA."

        "abstract": "Experience with the diagnosis of neural tube defects from alpha1-fetoprotein (AFP) concentrations in amniotic fluid is reported from a prospective study of five laboratories testing for 13 Canadian genetic centres. The results of the study indicate that antenatal diagnosis of open neural tube defects is being carried out effectively in Canada (in 99.2% of cases the AFP measurements were interpreted correctly). Amniocentesis should be recommended to women at high risk for having a child with a neural tube defect (i.e., those who have a child, a parent or a sibling with a neural tube defect). The rate of neural tube defects in 182 high-risk pregnancies was 2.2% for an open defect and 1.1% for a closed defect, whereas the rate in 673 pregnancies in which amniocentesis was being performed for other reasons was 0.3%. This suggests that the AFP concentration should be measured in any sample of amniotic fluid collected for other reasons (usually fetal karyotyping). There were three instances of false-negative results, for a rate of 0.4%. Two closed neural tube defects were not detected; this limitation of the test has also been found by others. One of the six fetuses with an open neural tube defect, who died in utero, had a large myelocele in the neck that was not recognized. There were also four instances of false-positive results, for a rate of 0.5%. The findings suggest that AFP values that are more than 2 but less than 7 standard deviations (SDs) above the mean may indicate a neural tube defect, and that values 7 or more SDs above the mean very likely indicate such a defect, although other reasons for such high values (e.g., fetal erythrocytes in the amniotic fluid, intrauterine death and mistaken gestational age) must be ruled out by other methods."
