        "abstract": "Mutations in the Caenorhabditis elegans genes lin-14, lin-28, and lin-29 cause heterochronic developmental defects: the timing of specific developmental events in several tissues is altered relative to the timing of events in other tissues. These defects result from temporal transformations in the fates of specific cells, that is, certain cells express fates normally expressed by cells generated at other developmental stages. The identification and characterization of genes that can be mutated to cause heterochrony support the proposal that heterochrony is a mechanism for phylogenetic change and suggest cellular and genetic bases for heterochronic variation."

        "title": "A single Argonaute protein mediates both transcriptional and posttranscriptional silencing in Schizosaccharomyces pombe.",
        "abstract": "The Schizosaccharomyces pombe genome encodes only one of each of the three major classes of proteins implicated in RNA silencing: Dicer (Dcr1), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP; Rdp1), and Argonaute (Ago1). These three proteins are required for silencing at centromeres and for the initiation of transcriptionally silent heterochromatin at the mating-type locus. Here, we show that the introduction of a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) hairpin corresponding to a green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgene triggers classical RNA interference (RNAi) in S. pombe. That is, GFP silencing triggered by dsRNA reflects a change in the steady-state concentration of GFP mRNA, but not in the rate of GFP transcription. RNAi in S. pombe requires dcr1, rdp1, and ago1, but does not require chp1, tas3, or swi6, genes required for transcriptional silencing. Thus, the RNAi machinery in S. pombe can direct both transcriptional and posttranscriptional silencing using a single Dicer, RdRP, and Argonaute protein. Our findings suggest that these three proteins fulfill a common biochemical function in distinct siRNA-directed silencing pathways."

        "abstract": "We show, with miR171, that plant miRNA genes are modular independent transcription units in which the fold-back pre-miRNA is sufficient for miRNA processing, and that the upstream region contains highly specific promoter elements. Processing depends on flanking sequences within the miRNA stem-loop precursor rather than the miRNA sequence itself, and mutations affecting target pairing at the center and 5' but not 3' region of the miRNA compromise its function in vivo. Inactivation of the SDE1 RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase was mandatory for accurate representation of miRNA activity by sensor constructs in Arabidopsis. Work in sde1 background revealed a near-perfect spatial overlap between the patterns of miR171 transcription and activity, supporting the idea that plant miRNAs enable cell differentiation."

It triggers different types of gene silencing that are collectively referred to as RNA silencing or RNA interference. A key step in known silencing pathways is the processing of dsRNAs into short RNA duplexes of characteristic size and structure. These short dsRNAs guide RNA silencing by specific and distinct mechanisms. Many components of the RNA silencing machinery still need to be identified and characterized, but a more complete understanding of the process is imminent."

In these pathways, silencing signals can be amplified and transmitted between cells, and may even be self-regulated by feedback mechanisms. Diverse biological roles of these pathways have been established, including defence against viruses, regulation of gene expression and the condensation of chromatin into heterochromatin. We are now in a good position to investigate the full extent of this functional diversity in genetic and epigenetic mechanisms of genome control."

        "abstract": "Soon after its discovery 75 years ago, heterochromatin, a dense chromosomal material, was found to silence genes. But its importance in regulating gene expression was controversial. Long thought to be inert, heterochromatin is now known to give rise to small RNAs, which, by means of RNA interference, direct the modification of proteins and DNA in heterochromatic repeats and transposable elements. Heterochromatin has thus emerged as a key factor in epigenetic regulation of gene expression, chromosome behaviour and evolution."

        "title": "MicroRNA genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase II.",
        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) constitute a large family of noncoding RNAs that function as guide molecules in diverse gene silencing pathways. Current efforts are focused on the regulatory function of miRNAs, while little is known about how these unusual genes themselves are regulated. Here we present the first direct evidence that miRNA genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase II (pol II). The primary miRNA transcripts (pri-miRNAs) contain cap structures as well as poly(A) tails, which are the unique properties of class II gene transcripts. The treatment of human cells with alpha-amanitin decreased the level of pri-miRNAs at a concentration that selectively inhibits pol II activity. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses show that pol II is physically associated with a miRNA promoter. We also describe, for the first time, the detailed structure of a miRNA gene by determining the promoter and the terminator of mir-23a approximately 27a approximately 24-2. These data indicate that pol II is the main, if not the only, RNA polymerase for miRNA gene transcription. Our study offers a basis for understanding the structure and regulation of miRNA genes."

        "title": "Fast and effective prediction of microRNA/target duplexes.",
        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short RNAs that post-transcriptionally regulate the expression of target genes by binding to the target mRNAs. Although a large number of animal miRNAs has been defined, only a few targets are known. In contrast to plant miRNAs, which usually bind nearly perfectly to their targets, animal miRNAs bind less tightly, with a few nucleotides being unbound, thus producing more complex secondary structures of miRNA/target duplexes. Here, we present a program, RNA-hybrid, that predicts multiple potential binding sites of miRNAs in large target RNAs. In general, the program finds the energetically most favorable hybridization sites of a small RNA in a large RNA. Intramolecular hybridizations, that is, base pairings between target nucleotides or between miRNA nucleotides are not allowed. For large targets, the time complexity of the algorithm is linear in the target length, allowing many long targets to be searched in a short time. Statistical significance of predicted targets is assessed with an extreme value statistics of length normalized minimum free energies, a Poisson approximation of multiple binding sites, and the calculation of effective numbers of orthologous targets in comparative studies of multiple organisms. We applied our method to the prediction of Drosophila miRNA targets in 3'UTRs and coding sequence. RNAhybrid, with its accompanying programs RNAcalibrate and RNAeffective, is available for download and as a Web tool on the Bielefeld Bioinformatics Server (http://bibiserv.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de/rnahybrid/)."

        "abstract": "\"RNA silencing\" refers to related processes of post-trancriptional control of gene expression found in plants, animals and fungi. A unifying feature of RNA silencing is that it mediates sequence-specific degradation of target transcripts, recruiting RNA molecules of 21-23 nucleotides as specificity determinants. In higher plants, RNA silencing serves as an adaptive, antiviral defence system, which is transmitted systemically in response to localized virus challenge. Plant viruses have elaborated a variety of counter-defensive measures to overcome the host silencing response. One of these strategies is to produce proteins that target the cell autonomous or signalling steps of RNA silencing. It is not known whether a similar antiviral mechanism also operates in animal cells."

        "title": "Argonaute2, a link between genetic and biochemical analyses of RNAi.",
        "abstract": "Double-stranded RNA induces potent and specific gene silencing through a process referred to as RNA interference (RNAi) or posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS). RNAi is mediated by RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), a sequence-specific, multicomponent nuclease that destroys messenger RNAs homologous to the silencing trigger. RISC is known to contain short RNAs ( approximately 22 nucleotides) derived from the double-stranded RNA trigger, but the protein components of this activity are unknown. Here, we report the biochemical purification of the RNAi effector nuclease from cultured Drosophila cells. The active fraction contains a ribonucleoprotein complex of approximately 500 kilodaltons. Protein microsequencing reveals that one constituent of this complex is a member of the Argonaute family of proteins, which are essential for gene silencing in Caenorhabditis elegans, Neurospora, and Arabidopsis. This observation begins the process of forging links between genetic analysis of RNAi from diverse organisms and the biochemical model of RNAi that is emerging from Drosophila in vitro systems."

        "title": "Arabidopsis ARGONAUTE1 is an RNA Slicer that selectively recruits microRNAs and short interfering RNAs.",
        "abstract": "ARGONAUTE (AGO) RNA-binding proteins are involved in RNA silencing. They bind to short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) through a conserved PAZ domain, and, in animals, they assemble into a multisubunit RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). The mammalian AGO2, termed Slicer, directs siRNA- and miRNA-mediated cleavage of a target RNA. In Arabidopsis, there are 10 members of the AGO family, and the AGO1 protein is potentially the Slicer component in different RNA-silencing pathways. Here, we show that AGO1 selectively recruits certain classes of short silencing-related RNA. AGO1 is physically associated with miRNAs, transacting siRNAs, and transgene-derived siRNAs but excludes virus-derived siRNAs and 24-nt siRNAs involved in chromatin silencing. We also show that AGO1 has Slicer activity. It mediates the in vitro cleavage of a mir165 target RNA in a manner that depends on the sequence identity of amino acid residues in the PIWI domain that are predicted by homology with animal Slicer-competent AGO proteins to constitute the RNase catalytic center. However, unlike animals, we find no evidence that AGO1 Slicer is in a high molecular weight RNA-induced silencing complex. The Slicer activity fractionates as a complex of approximately 150 kDa that likely constitutes the AGO1 protein and associated RNA without any other proteins. Based on sequence similarity, we predict that other Arabidopsis AGOs might have a similar catalytic activity but recruit different subsets of siRNAs or miRNAs."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are approximately 21-nucleotide-long RNA molecules regulating gene expression in multicellular eukaryotes. In metazoa, miRNAs act by imperfectly base-pairing with the 3' untranslated region of target messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and repressing protein accumulation by an unknown mechanism. We demonstrate that endogenous let-7 microribonucleoproteins (miRNPs) or the tethering of Argonaute (Ago) proteins to reporter mRNAs in human cells inhibit translation initiation. M(7)G-cap-independent translation is not subject to repression, suggesting that miRNPs interfere with recognition of the cap. Repressed mRNAs, Ago proteins, and miRNAs were all found to accumulate in processing bodies. We propose that localization of mRNAs to these structures is a consequence of translational repression."

        "abstract": "After the milestone discovery of the first microRNA in 1993, the past five years have seen a phenomenal surge of interest in these short, regulatory RNAs. Given that 2% of all known human genes encode microRNAs, one main goal is to uncover microRNA function. Although it has been more difficult to assign function to microRNAs in animals than it has been in plants, important roles are emerging: in invertebrates, microRNAs control developmental timing, neuronal differentiation, tissue growth and programmed cell death. Functional studies in zebrafish and mice point toward important roles for microRNAs during morphogenesis and organogenesis. Finally, microRNAs might regulate viral infection and human cancer."

        "abstract": "Dicer is an RNase III-family nuclease that initiates RNA interference (RNAi) and related phenomena by generation of the small RNAs that determine the specificity of these gene silencing pathways. We have previously shown that Dicer is essential for mammalian development, with Dicer-deficient mice dying at embryonic day 7.5 with a lack of detectable multipotent stem cells. To permit a more detailed investigation of the biological roles of Dicer, we have generated embryonic stem cell lines in which their single Dicer gene can be conditionally inactivated. As expected, Dicer loss compromises maturation of microRNAs and leads to a defect in gene silencing triggered by long dsRNAs. However, the absence of Dicer does not affect the ability of small interfering RNAs to repress gene expression. Of interest, Dicer loss does compromise the proliferation of ES cells, possibly rationalizing the phenotype previously observed in Dicer-null animals. Dicer loss also affects the abundance of transcripts from mammalian centromeres but does so without a pronounced affect on histone modification status at pericentric repeats or methylation of centromeric DNA. These studies provide a conditional model of RNAi deficiency in mammals that will permit the dissection of the biological roles of the RNAi machinery in cultured mammalian cells."

        "abstract": "microRNAs are small noncoding genes that regulate the protein production of genes by binding to partially complementary sites in the mRNAs of targeted genes. Here, using our algorithm PicTar, we exploit cross-species comparisons to predict, on average, 54 targeted genes per microRNA above noise in Drosophila melanogaster. Analysis of the functional annotation of target genes furthermore suggests specific biological functions for many microRNAs. We also predict combinatorial targets for clustered microRNAs and find that some clustered microRNAs are likely to coordinately regulate target genes. Furthermore, we compare microRNA regulation between insects and vertebrates. We find that the widespread extent of gene regulation by microRNAs is comparable between flies and mammals but that certain microRNAs may function in clade-specific modes of gene regulation. One of these microRNAs (miR-210) is predicted to contribute to the regulation of fly oogenesis. We also list specific regulatory relationships that appear to be conserved between flies and mammals. Our findings provide the most extensive microRNA target predictions in Drosophila to date, suggest specific functional roles for most microRNAs, indicate the existence of coordinate gene regulation executed by clustered microRNAs, and shed light on the evolution of microRNA function across large evolutionary distances.

        "abstract": "In metazoans, microRNAs (miRNAs) carry out various regulatory functions through association with multiprotein miRNA-induced silencing complexes (miRISCs) that contain Dicer and Argonaute proteins. How miRNAs regulate the expression of their mRNA targets remains a major research question. We have identified the C. elegans ain-1 gene through a genetic suppressor screen and shown that it functions with the heterochronic genetic pathway that regulates developmental timing. Biochemical analysis indicates that AIN-1 interacts with protein complexes containing an Argonaute protein, Dicer, and miRNAs. AIN-1 shares homology with the candidate human neurological disease protein GW182, shown to localize in cytoplasmic processing bodies that are sites of mRNA degradation and storage. A functional AIN-1::GFP also localizes at the likely worm processing bodies. When coexpressed from transgenes, AIN-1 targets ALG-1 to the foci. These results suggest a model where AIN-1 regulates a subset of miRISCs by localization to the processing bodies, facilitating degradation or translational inhibition of mRNA targets."

        "abstract": "Small RNAs of 21-25 nucleotides (nt), including small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs), act as guide RNAs to silence target-gene expression in a sequence-specific manner. In addition to a Dicer homolog, DCL1, the biogenesis of miRNAs in Arabidopsis requires another protein, HEN1. miRNAs are reduced in abundance and increased in size in hen1 mutants. We found that HEN1 is a miRNA methyltransferase that adds a methyl group to the 3'-most nucleotide of miRNAs, but the role of miRNA methylation was unknown. Here, we show that siRNAs from sense transgenes, hairpin transgenes, and transposons or repeat sequences, as well as a new class of siRNAs known as trans-acting siRNAs, are also methylated in vivo by HEN1. In addition, we show that the size increase of small RNAs in the hen1-1 mutant is due to the addition of one to five U residues to the 3' ends of the small RNAs. Therefore, a novel uridylation activity targets the 3' ends of unmethylated miRNAs and siRNAs in hen1 mutants. We conclude that 3'-end methylation is a common step in miRNA and siRNA metabolism and likely protects the 3' ends of the small RNAs from the uridylation activity."

        "abstract": "Post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) provides protection against viruses in plants by homology-dependent RNA degradation. PTGS initiated locally produces a mobile signal that instructs specific RNA degradation at a distance. Here we show that this signal-mediated intercellular spread of PTGS does not occur after PTGS initiation in cells expressing cucumber mosaic virus 2b protein (Cmv2b), a nucleus-localized plant viral PTGS suppressor. Silencing spread via the signal was also effectively blocked in independent assays by expressing Cmv2b only in tissues through which the signal must travel to induce PTGS in the target cells. Furthermore, the signal imported externally into the Cmv2b-expressing cells was not active in triggering degradation of the target RNA and loss of signal activity in these cells was associated with a significantly reduced transgene DNA methylation. These findings indicate that Cmv2b inhibits the activity of the mobile signal and interferes with DNA methylation in the nucleus. Signal inactivation provides a mechanistic basis for the known role of Cmv2b in facilitating virus spread to tissues outside of the primarily infected sites."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short, stable, noncoding RNAs involved in post-transcriptional gene silencing via hybridization to mRNA. Few have been thoroughly characterized in any species. Here, we describe a method to detect miRNAs using micro-arrays, in which the miRNAs are directly hybridized to the array. We used this method to analyze miRNA expression across 17 mouse organs and tissues. More than half of the 78 miRNAs detected were expressed in specific adult tissues, suggesting that miRNAs have widespread regulatory roles in adults. By comparing miRNA levels to mRNA levels determined in a parallel microarray analysis of the same tissues, we found that the expression of target mRNAs predicted on the basis of sequence complementarity is unrelated to the tissues in which the corresponding miRNA is expressed."

        "title": "Human MicroRNA targets.",
        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) interact with target mRNAs at specific sites to induce cleavage of the message or inhibit translation. The specific function of most mammalian miRNAs is unknown. We have predicted target sites on the 3' untranslated regions of human gene transcripts for all currently known 218 mammalian miRNAs to facilitate focused experiments. We report about 2,000 human genes with miRNA target sites conserved in mammals and about 250 human genes conserved as targets between mammals and fish. The prediction algorithm optimizes sequence complementarity using position-specific rules and relies on strict requirements of interspecies conservation. Experimental support for the validity of the method comes from known targets and from strong enrichment of predicted targets in mRNAs associated with the fragile X mental retardation protein in mammals. This is consistent with the hypothesis that miRNAs act as sequence-specific adaptors in the interaction of ribonuclear particles with translationally regulated messages. Overrepresented groups of targets include mRNAs coding for transcription factors, components of the miRNA machinery, and other proteins involved in translational regulation, as well as components of the ubiquitin machinery, representing novel feedback loops in gene regulation. Detailed information about target genes, target processes, and open-source software for target prediction (miRanda) is available at http://www.microrna.org. Our analysis suggests that miRNA genes, which are about 1% of all human genes, regulate protein production for 10% or more of all human genes."

        "abstract": "microRNAs (miRNAs) are a new class of non-protein-coding, endogenous, small RNAs. They are important regulatory molecules in animals and plants. miRNA regulates gene expression by translational repression, mRNA cleavage, and mRNA decay initiated by miRNA-guided rapid deadenylation. Recent studies show that some miRNAs regulate cell proliferation and apoptosis processes that are important in cancer formation. By using multiple molecular techniques, which include Northern blot analysis, real-time PCR, miRNA microarray, up- or down-expression of specific miRNAs, it was found that several miRNAs were directly involved in human cancers, including lung, breast, brain, liver, colon cancer, and leukemia. In addition, some miRNAs may function as oncogenes or tumor suppressors. More than 50% of miRNA genes are located in cancer-associated genomic regions or in fragile sites, suggesting that miRNAs may play a more important role in the pathogenesis of a limited range of human cancers than previously thought. Overexpressed miRNAs in cancers, such as mir-17-92, may function as oncogenes and promote cancer development by negatively regulating tumor suppressor genes and/or genes that control cell differentiation or apoptosis. Underexpressed miRNAs in cancers, such as let-7, function as tumor suppressor genes and may inhibit cancers by regulating oncogenes and/or genes that control cell differentiation or apoptosis. miRNA expression profiles may become useful biomarkers for cancer diagnostics. In addition, miRNA therapy could be a powerful tool for cancer prevention and therapeutics."

        "abstract": "We present rna22, a method for identifying microRNA binding sites and their corresponding heteroduplexes. Rna22 does not rely upon cross-species conservation, is resilient to noise, and, unlike previous methods, it first finds putative microRNA binding sites in the sequence of interest, then identifies the targeting microRNA. Computationally, we show that rna22 identifies most of the currently known heteroduplexes. Experimentally, with luciferase assays, we demonstrate average repressions of 30% or more for 168 of 226 tested targets. The analysis suggests that some microRNAs may have as many as a few thousand targets, and that between 74% and 92% of the gene transcripts in four model genomes are likely under microRNA control through their untranslated and amino acid coding regions. We also extended the method's key idea to a low-error microRNA-precursor-discovery scheme; our studies suggest that the number of microRNA precursors in mammalian genomes likely ranges in the tens of thousands."

        "abstract": "DNA methylation has important functions in stable, transcriptional gene silencing, immobilization of transposable elements and genome organization. In Arabidopsis, DNA methylation can be induced by double-stranded RNA through the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway, a response known as RNA-directed DNA methylation. This requires a specialized set of RNAi components, including ARGONAUTE4 (AGO4). Here we show that AGO4 binds to small RNAs including small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) originating from transposable and repetitive elements, and cleaves target RNA transcripts. Single mutations in the Asp-Asp-His catalytic motif of AGO4 do not affect siRNA-binding activity but abolish its catalytic potential. siRNA accumulation and non-CpG DNA methylation at some loci require the catalytic activity of AGO4, whereas others are less dependent on this activity. Our results are consistent with a model in which AGO4 can function at target loci through two distinct and separable mechanisms. First, AGO4 can recruit components that signal DNA methylation in a manner independent of its catalytic activity. Second, AGO4 catalytic activity can be crucial for the generation of secondary siRNAs that reinforce its repressive effects."

Transition from the first to the second larval stage fates requires the 22-nucleotide lin-4 RNA, and transition from late larval to adult cell fates requires the 21-nucleotide let-7 RNA. The lin-4 and let-7 RNA genes are not homologous to each other, but are each complementary to sequences in the 3' untranslated regions of a set of protein-coding target genes that are normally negatively regulated by the RNAs. Here we have detected let-7 RNAs of approximately 21 nucleotides in samples from a wide range of animal species, including vertebrate, ascidian, hemichordate, mollusc, annelid and arthropod, but not in RNAs from several cnidarian and poriferan species, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Escherichia coli or Arabidopsis. We did not detect lin-4 RNA in these species. We found that let-7 temporal regulation is also conserved: let-7 RNA expression is first detected at late larval stages in C. elegans and Drosophila, at 48 hours after fertilization in zebrafish, and in adult stages of annelids and molluscs. The let-7 regulatory RNA may control late temporal transitions during development across animal phylogeny."

        "abstract": "microRNAs (miRNAs) are small, functional, non-coding RNAs. miRNAs are transcribed as long primary transcripts (primary precursors) that are processed to the approximately 75 nt precursors (pre-miRNAs) by the nuclear enzyme Drosha. The approximately 22 nt mature miRNA is processed from the pre-miRNA by the RNase III Dicer. The vast majority of published studies to date have used northern blotting to detect the expression of miRNAs. We describe here a sensitive, high throughput, real-time PCR assay to monitor the expression of miRNA precursors. Gene-specific primers and reverse transcriptase were used to convert the primary precursors and pre-miRNAs to cDNA. The expression of 23 miRNA precursors in six human cancer cell lines was assayed using the PCR assay. The miRNA precursors accumulated to different levels when compared with each other or when a single precursor is compared in the various cell lines. The precursor expression profile of three miRNAs determined by the PCR assay was identical to the mature miRNA expression profile determined by northern blotting. We propose that the PCR assay may be scaled up to include all of the 150+ known human miRNA genes and can easily be adaptable to other organisms such as plants, Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila."

        "title": "Spatially restricted microRNA directs leaf polarity through ARGONAUTE1.",
        "abstract": "Gene regulation by RNA interference requires the functions of the PAZ domain protein Argonaute. In plants, mutations in ARGONAUTE1 (AGO1) are associated with distinctive developmental defects that suggest a role for microRNA (miRNA) in organ polarity. Potential targets of miRNA regulation are the homeodomain/leucine zipper genes PHABULOSA (PHB) and PHAVOLUTA (PHV). These genes are expressed in a polar fashion in leaf primordia and are required for adaxial cell fate. Here we show that a 21-nucleotide miRNA that directs cleavage of PHB/PHV messenger RNA accumulates first in the embryonic meristem, and then in the abaxial domain of the developing leaf. miRNA distribution is disrupted by mutations in AGO1, indicating that AGO1 affects the regulation of miRNA. In addition, interactions between homeodomain/leucine zipper genes and an allelic series of ago1 indicate that miRNA acts as a signal to specify leaf polarity."

        "title": "microRNA-mediated repression of rolled leaf1 specifies maize leaf polarity.",
        "abstract": "In both animals and plants, many developmentally important regulatory genes have complementary microRNAs (miRNAs), which suggests that these miRNAs constitute a class of developmental signalling molecules. Leaves of higher plants exhibit a varying degree of asymmetry along the adaxial/abaxial (upper/lower) axis. This asymmetry is specified through the polarized expression of class III homeodomain/leucine zipper (HD-ZIPIII) genes. In Arabidopsis, three such genes, PHABULOSA (PHB), PHAVOLUTA (PHV) and REVOLUTA (REV), are expressed throughout the incipient leaf, but become adaxially localized after primordium emergence. Downregulation of the HD-ZIPIII genes allows expression of the KANADI and YABBY genes, which specify abaxial fate. PHB, PHV and REV transcripts contain a complementary site for miRNA165 and miRNA166, which can direct their cleavage in vitro. Here we show that miRNA166 constitutes a highly conserved polarizing signal whose expression pattern spatially defines the expression domain of the maize hd-zipIII family member rolled leaf1 (rld1). Moreover, the progressively expanding expression pattern of miRNA166 during leaf development and its accumulation in phloem suggests that miRNA166 may form a movable signal that emanates from a signalling centre below the incipient leaf."

A total of 19 brain-expressed miRNAs (including lin-4 and let-7 orthologs) were coordinately upregulated in both human and mouse embryonal carcinoma cells during neuronal differentiation. The mammalian ortholog of C. elegans lin-28, which is downregulated by lin-4 in worms via 3' untranslated region binding, was also repressed during neuronal differentiation of mammalian embryonal carcinoma cells.

        "abstract": "Non-coding small endogenous RNAs, of 21-24 nucleotides in length, have recently emerged as important regulators of gene expression in both plants and animals. At least three categories of small RNAs exist in plants: short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) deriving from viruses or transgenes and mediating virus resistance or transgene silencing via RNA degradation; siRNAs deriving from transposons or transgene promoters and controlling transposon and transgene silencing probably via chromatin changes; and microRNAs (miRNAs) deriving from intergenic regions of the genome and regulating the expression of endogenous genes either by mRNA cleavage or translational repression. The disruption of miRNA-mediated regulation causes developmental abnormalities in plants, demonstrating that miRNAs play an important role in the regulation of developmental decisions."

        "abstract": "Proteins that specifically bind double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) are involved in the regulation of cellular signaling events and gene expression, and are characterized by a conserved dsRNA-binding motif (dsRBM). Here we report the biochemical properties of nine such gene products, each containing one or two dsRBMs: four Arabidopsis Dicer-like proteins (DCL1-4), Arabidopsis HYL1 and four of its homologs (DRB2, DRB4, DRB5 and OsDRB1). DCL1, DCL3, HYL1 and the four HYL1 homologs exhibit significant dsRNA-binding activity, indicating that these proteins are involved in RNA metabolism. The dsRBMs from dsRBM-containing proteins (dsRBPs) also function as a protein-protein interaction domain and homo- and heterodimerization are essential for biological functioning of these proteins. We show that DRB4 interacts specifically with DCL4, and HYL1 most strongly interacts with DCL1. These results indicate that each HYL1/DRB family protein interacts with one specific partner among the four Dicer-like proteins. Localization studies using GFP fusion proteins demonstrate that DCL1, DCL4, HYL1 and DRB4 localize in the nucleus, while DRB2 is present in the cytoplasm. Subcellular localizations of HYL1, DRB4, DCL1 and DCL4 further strengthen the notion that HYL1 and DCL1, and DRB4 and DCL4, exist as complexes. The presented data suggest that each member of the HYL1/DRB protein family may individually modulate Dicer function through heterodimerization with a Dicer-like protein in vivo."

        "abstract": "The phytohormone auxin plays critical roles during plant growth, many of which are mediated by the auxin response transcription factor (ARF) family. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), endogenous 21-nucleotide riboregulators, target several mRNAs implicated in auxin responses. miR160 targets ARF10, ARF16, and ARF17, three of the 23 Arabidopsis thaliana ARF genes. Here, we describe roles of miR160-directed ARF17 posttranscriptional regulation. Plants expressing a miRNA-resistant version of ARF17 have increased ARF17 mRNA levels and altered accumulation of auxin-inducible GH3-like mRNAs, YDK1/GH3.2, GH3.3, GH3.5, and DFL1/GH3.6, which encode auxin-conjugating proteins. These expression changes correlate with dramatic developmental defects, including embryo and emerging leaf symmetry anomalies, leaf shape defects, premature inflorescence development, altered phyllotaxy along the stem, reduced petal size, abnormal stamens, sterility, and root growth defects. These defects demonstrate the importance of miR160-directed ARF17 regulation and implicate ARF17 as a regulator of GH3-like early auxin response genes. Many of these defects resemble phenotypes previously observed in plants expressing viral suppressors of RNA silencing and plants with mutations in genes important for miRNA biogenesis or function, providing a molecular rationale for phenotypes previously associated with more general disruptions of miRNA function."

        "abstract": "Although several plant microRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to play a role in plant development, no phenotype has yet been associated with a reduction or loss of expression of any plant miRNA. Arabidopsis thaliana miR164 was predicted to target five NAM/ATAF/CUC (NAC) domain-encoding mRNAs, including NAC1, which transduces auxin signals for lateral root emergence. Here, we show that miR164 guides the cleavage of endogenous and transgenic NAC1 mRNA, producing 3'-specific fragments. Cleavage was blocked by NAC1 mutations that disrupt base pairing with miR164. Compared with wild-type plants, Arabidopsis mir164a and mir164b mutant plants expressed less miR164 and more NAC1 mRNA and produced more lateral roots. These mutant phenotypes can be complemented by expression of the appropriate MIR164a and MIR164b genomic sequences. By contrast, inducible expression of miR164 in wild-type plants led to decreased NAC1 mRNA levels and reduced lateral root emergence. Auxin induction of miR164 was mirrored by an increase in the NAC1 mRNA 3' fragment, which was not observed in the auxin-insensitive mutants auxin resistant1 (axr1-12), axr2-1, and transport inhibitor response1. Moreover, the cleavage-resistant form of NAC1 mRNA was unaffected by auxin treatment. Our results indicate that auxin induction of miR164 provides a homeostatic mechanism to clear NAC1 mRNA to downregulate auxin signals."

        "title": "Pervasive regulation of Drosophila Notch target genes by GY-box-, Brd-box-, and K-box-class microRNAs.",
        "abstract": "Although hundreds of distinct animal microRNAs (miRNAs) are known, the specific biological functions of only a handful are understood at present. Here, we demonstrate that three different families of Drosophila miRNAs directly regulate two large families of Notch target genes, including basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) repressor and Bearded family genes. These miRNAs regulate Notch target gene activity via GY-box (GUCUUCC), Brd-box (AGCUUUA), and K-box (cUGUGAUa) motifs. These are conserved sites in target 3'-untranslated regions (3'-UTRs) that are complementary to the 5'-ends of miRNAs, or \"seed\" regions. Collectively, these motifs represent >40 miRNA-binding sites in Notch target genes, and we show all three classes of motif to be necessary and sufficient for miRNA-mediated regulation in vivo. Importantly, many of the validated miRNA-binding sites have limited pairing to miRNAs outside of the \"box:seed\" region. Consistent with this, we find that seed-related miRNAs that are otherwise quite divergent can regulate the same target sequences. Finally, we demonstrate that ectopic expression of several Notch-regulating miRNAs induces mutant phenotypes that are characteristic of Notch pathway loss of function, including loss of wing margin, thickened wing veins, increased bristle density, and tufted bristles.

        "abstract": "Research over the past few years has led to dramatic new discoveries on the role of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) in the cell. RNA duplexes have been shown to orchestrate epigenetic changes, repress translation, and direct mRNA degradation in a sequence-specific manner. These diverse effects of dsRNA on gene expression have been termed RNA interference (RNAi). In addition to playing a role in viral defense and silencing transposons, RNAi also has a critical function in a number of developmental processes in the embryo. In this review, we explore these roles and discuss the molecular mechanisms behind dsRNA-mediated gene silencing. Further, we address the use of RNAi as a tool to study gene function in biology, and as a strategy for treating human disease."

        "abstract": "Several hundred microRNAs (miRNAs) have recently been cloned from a wide range of organisms across phylogeny. Despite the high degree of conservation of miRNAs, their functions in general, and in mammals particularly, are just beginning to be defined. Here we show that an oligonucleotide DNA array can be successfully used for the simultaneous analysis of miRNA expression profiles from tissues or cells. From a subset of miRNAs expressed in the brain we designed an oligonucleotide array spotted with probes specific for 44 mature miRNAs. These arrays demonstrated precise regulation of miRNA expression at mammalian brain developmental epochs. About 20% of the probed miRNAs changed significantly in their expression during normal brain development, and two of them, miR-9 and miR-131, were dysregulated in presenilin-1 null mice exhibiting severe brain developmental defects. Transcripts with regulated expression patterns on the arrays were validated by Northern blots. Additionally, a bioinformatic analysis of developmentally regulated miRNAs suggested potential mRNA targets. The arrays also revealed miRNAs distributed to translating polyribosomes in primary neurons where they are likely to modulate translation. Therefore, oligonucleotide arrays provide a new tool for studying miRNA expression in a variety of biological and pathobiological settings. Creating clusters of coexpressed miRNAs will contribute to understanding their regulation, functions, and discovery of mRNA targets."

        "title": "MicroRNAs: regulators of gene expression and cell differentiation.",
        "abstract": "The existence and roles of a class of abundant regulatory RNA molecules have recently come into sharp focus. Micro-RNAs (miRNAs) are small (approximately 22 bases), non-protein-coding RNAs that recognize target sequences of imperfect complementarity in cognate mRNAs and either destabilize them or inhibit protein translation. Although mechanisms of miRNA biogenesis have been elucidated in some detail, there is limited appreciation of their biological functions. Reported examples typically focus on miRNA regulation of a single tissue-restricted transcript, often one encoding a transcription factor, that controls a specific aspect of development, cell differentiation, or physiology. However, computational algorithms predict up to hundreds of putative targets for individual miRNAs, single transcripts may be regulated by multiple miRNAs, and miRNAs may either eliminate target gene expression or serve to finetune transcript and protein levels. Theoretical considerations and early experimental results hence suggest diverse roles for miRNAs as a class. One appealing possibility, that miRNAs eliminate low-level expression of unwanted genes and hence refine unilineage gene expression, may be especially amenable to evaluation in models of hematopoiesis. This review summarizes current understanding of miRNA mechanisms, outlines some of the important outstanding questions, and describes studies that attempt to define miRNA functions in hematopoiesis."

While hundreds of mammalian miRNA genes have been identified, little is known about the pathways that regulate the production of active miRNA species. Here we show that a large fraction of miRNA genes are regulated post-transcriptionally. During early mouse development, many miRNA primary transcripts, including the Let-7 family, are present at high levels but are not processed by the enzyme Drosha. An analysis of gene expression in primary tumors indicates that the widespread down-regulation of miRNAs observed in cancer is due to a failure at the Drosha processing step. These data uncover a novel regulatory step in miRNA function and provide a mechanism for miRNA down-regulation in cancer."

        "abstract": "In Drosophila, Piwi (P-element-induced wimpy testis), which encodes a protein of the Argonaute family, is essential for germ stem cell self-renewal. Piwi has recently been shown to be a nuclear protein involved in gene silencing of retrotransposons and controlling their mobilization in the male germline. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms of Piwi-dependent gene silencing. Here we show that endogenous Piwi immunopurified from ovary specifically associates with small RNAs of 25-29 nucleotides in length. Piwi-associated small RNAs were identified by cloning and sequencing as repeat-associated small interfering RNAs (rasiRNAs) derived from repetitive regions, such as retrotransposon and heterochromatic regions, in the Drosophila genome. Northern blot analyses revealed that in vivo Piwi does not associate with microRNAs (miRNAs) and that guide siRNA was not loaded onto Piwi when siRNA duplex was added to ovary lysate. In vitro, recombinant Piwi exhibits target RNA cleavage activity. These data together imply that Piwi functions in nuclear RNA silencing as Slicer by associating specifically with rasiRNAs originating from repetitive targets."

        "abstract": "Activation of mammalian innate and acquired immune responses must be tightly regulated by elaborate mechanisms to control their onset and termination. MicroRNAs have been implicated as negative regulators controlling diverse biological processes at the level of posttranscriptional repression. Expression profiling of 200 microRNAs in human monocytes revealed that several of them (miR-146a/b, miR-132, and miR-155) are endotoxin-responsive genes. Analysis of miR-146a and miR-146b gene expression unveiled a pattern of induction in response to a variety of microbial components and proinflammatory cytokines. By means of promoter analysis, miR-146a was found to be a NF-kappaB-dependent gene. Importantly, miR-146a/b were predicted to base-pair with sequences in the 3' UTRs of the TNF receptor-associated factor 6 and IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 genes, and we found that these UTRs inhibit expression of a linked reporter gene. These genes encode two key adapter molecules downstream of Toll-like and cytokine receptors. Thus, we propose a role for miR-146 in control of Toll-like receptor and cytokine signaling through a negative feedback regulation loop involving down-regulation of IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 and TNF receptor-associated factor 6 protein levels."

        "abstract": "Several classes of endogenous small RNAs of 20-26 nucleotides, such as microRNAs and small interfering (si)RNAs, have been described in plants and animals. Arabidopsis currently seems to be an exception because a novel genetically distinguishable small RNA class, termed natural-antisense transcript derived siRNAs, was recently identified. Pathways for the biogenesis and function of each class are already well characterized, enabling their classification on the basis of both size and proteins required for their function. However, each pathway requires proteins belonging to conserved protein families, and recent genetic studies confirmed an expected partial redundancy between members of the Dicer-like (DCL) family. Moreover, several experimental results indicate redundancies among double-strand RNA binding proteins and ARGONAUTE proteins, which probably create a complex network of small RNA pathways."

Several hundred microRNA genes have been identified in Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila, plants and mammals. MicroRNAs have been linked to developmental processes in C. elegans, plants and humans and to cell growth and apoptosis in Drosophila. A major impediment in the study of microRNA function is the lack of quantitative expression profiling methods. To close this technological gap, we have designed dual-channel microarrays that monitor expression levels of 124 mammalian microRNAs. Using these tools, we observed distinct patterns of expression among adult mouse tissues and embryonic stem cells. Expression profiles of staged embryos demonstrate temporal regulation of a large class of microRNAs, including members of the let-7 family. This microarray technology enables comprehensive investigation of microRNA expression, and furthers our understanding of this class of recently discovered noncoding RNAs."

The technique is termed the RNA-primed, array-based Klenow enzyme (RAKE) assay, because it involves on-slide application of the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I to extend unmodified miRNAs hybridized to immobilized DNA probes. We used RAKE to study human cell lines and brain tumors. We show that the RAKE assay is sensitive and specific for miRNAs and is ideally suited for rapid expression profiling of all known miRNAs. RAKE offers unique advantages for specificity over northern blots or other microarray-based expression profiling platforms. Furthermore, we demonstrate that miRNAs can be isolated and profiled from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue, which opens up new opportunities for analyses of small RNAs from archival human tissue. The RAKE assay is theoretically versatile and may be used for other applications, such as viral gene profiling."

In contrast to most eukaryotic miRNAs, these viral miRNAs do not have close homologs in other viral genomes or in the genome of the human host. To identify other miRNA genes in pathogenic viruses, we combined a new miRNA gene prediction method with small-RNA cloning from several virus-infected cell types. We cloned ten miRNAs in the Kaposi sarcoma-associated virus (KSHV or HHV8), nine miRNAs in the mouse gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68) and nine miRNAs in the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV or HHV5). These miRNA genes are expressed individually or in clusters from either polymerase (pol) II or pol III promoters, and share no substantial sequence homology with one another or with the known human miRNAs. Generally, we predicted miRNAs in several large DNA viruses, and we could neither predict nor experimentally identify miRNAs in the genomes of small RNA viruses or retroviruses."

        "title": "MicroRNAs: a developing story.",
        "abstract": "Considering the intense genetic efforts applied to understanding development, it is surprising that a relatively large class of regulatory genes has newly surfaced. The first microRNA gene and its developmental role were described more than ten years ago, but only recently have we fully appreciated the broad and abundant presence of such genes. MicroRNAs are approximately 22 nucleotide RNAs that use antisense complementarity to inhibit expression of specific mRNAs. Recent studies of restricted expression patterns and functional roles have implicated specific microRNAs in complex genetic pathways regulating embryogenesis, hematopoiesis, neuronal differentiation and Hox-mediated development."

        "title": "Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus expresses an array of viral microRNAs in latently infected cells.",
        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an endogenously encoded class of small RNAs that have been proposed to function as key posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression in a range of eukaryotic species, including humans. The small size of miRNA precursors makes them potentially ideal for use by viruses as inhibitors of host cell defense pathways. Here, we demonstrate that the pathogenic human herpesvirus Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) encodes an array of 11 distinct miRNAs, all of which are expressed at readily detectable levels in latently KSHV infected cells. Individual KSHV miRNAs were expressed at up to 2,200 copies per cell. The KSHV miRNAs are expressed from what appears to be a single genetic locus that largely coincides with an approximately 4-kb noncoding sequence located between the KSHV v-cyclin and K12/Kaposin genes, both of which are also expressed in latently infected cells. Computer analysis of potential mRNA targets for these viral miRNAs identified a number of interesting candidate genes, including several mRNAs previously shown to be down-regulated in KSHV-infected cells. We hypothesize that these viral miRNAs play a critical role in the establishment and/or maintenance of KSHV latent infection in vivo and, hence, in KSHV-induced oncogenesis."

        "title": "Structural insights into mRNA recognition from a PIWI domain-siRNA guide complex.",
        "abstract": "RNA interference and related RNA silencing phenomena use short antisense guide RNA molecules to repress the expression of target genes. Argonaute proteins, containing amino-terminal PAZ (for PIWI/Argonaute/Zwille) domains and carboxy-terminal PIWI domains, are core components of these mechanisms. Here we show the crystal structure of a Piwi protein from Archaeoglobus fulgidus (AfPiwi) in complex with a small interfering RNA (siRNA)-like duplex, which mimics the 5' end of a guide RNA strand bound to an overhanging target messenger RNA. The structure contains a highly conserved metal-binding site that anchors the 5' nucleotide of the guide RNA. The first base pair of the duplex is unwound, separating the 5' nucleotide of the guide from the complementary nucleotide on the target strand, which exits with the 3' overhang through a short channel. The remaining base-paired nucleotides assume an A-form helix, accommodated within a channel in the PIWI domain, which can be extended to place the scissile phosphate of the target strand adjacent to the putative slicer catalytic site. This study provides insights into mechanisms of target mRNA recognition and cleavage by an Argonaute-siRNA guide complex."

        "abstract": "RNA interference (RNAi) is a conserved sequence-specific gene regulatory mechanism mediated by the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which is composed of a single-stranded guide RNA and an Argonaute protein. The PIWI domain, a highly conserved motif within Argonaute, has been shown to adopt an RNase H fold critical for the endonuclease cleavage activity of RISC. Here we report the crystal structure of Archaeoglobus fulgidus Piwi protein bound to double-stranded RNA, thereby identifying the binding pocket for guide-strand 5'-end recognition and providing insight into guide-strand-mediated messenger RNA target recognition. The phosphorylated 5' end of the guide RNA is anchored within a highly conserved basic pocket, supplemented by the carboxy-terminal carboxylate and a bound divalent cation. The first nucleotide from the 5' end of the guide RNA is unpaired and stacks over a conserved tyrosine residue, whereas successive nucleotides form a four-base-pair RNA duplex. Mutation of the corresponding amino acids that contact the 5' phosphate in human Ago2 resulted in attenuated mRNA cleavage activity. Our structure of the Piwi-RNA complex, and that determined elsewhere, provide direct support for the 5' region of the guide RNA serving as a nucleation site for pairing with target mRNA and for a fixed distance separating the RISC-mediated mRNA cleavage site from the anchored 5' end of the guide RNA."

        "abstract": "Genetic, biochemical and structural studies have implicated Argonaute proteins as the catalytic core of the RNAi effector complex, RISC. Here we show that recombinant, human Argonaute2 can combine with a small interfering RNA (siRNA) to form minimal RISC that accurately cleaves substrate RNAs. Recombinant RISC shows many of the properties of RISC purified from human or Drosophila melanogaster cells but also has surprising features. It shows no stimulation by ATP, suggesting that factors promoting product release are missing from the recombinant enzyme. The active site is made up of a unique Asp-Asp-His (DDH) motif. In the RISC reconstitution system, the siRNA 5' phosphate is important for the stability and the fidelity of the complex but is not essential for the creation of an active enzyme. These studies demonstrate that Argonaute proteins catalyze mRNA cleavage within RISC and provide a source of recombinant enzyme for detailed biochemical studies of the RNAi effector complex."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a growing family of small noncoding RNAs that downregulate gene expression in a sequence-specific manner. The identification of the entire set of miRNAs from a model organism is a critical step toward understanding miRNA-guided gene regulation. Rice (Oryza sativa) and Arabidopsis thaliana, two plant model species with fully sequenced genomes, are representatives of monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous flowering plants, respectively. Thus far, experimental identification of miRNAs in plants has been confined to Arabidopsis. Computational analysis based on conservation with known miRNAs from Arabidopsis has predicted 20 families of miRNAs in rice. To identify miRNAs that are difficult to predict in silico or not conserved in Arabidopsis, we generated three cDNA libraries of small RNAs from rice shoot, root, and inflorescence tissues. We identified 35 miRNAs, of which 14 are new, and these define 13 new families. Thirteen of the new miRNAs are not conserved in Arabidopsis. Four of the new miRNAs are conserved in related monocot species but not in Arabidopsis, which suggests that these may have evolved after the divergence of monocots and dicots. The remaining nine new miRNAs appear to be absent in the known sequences of other plant species. Most of the rice miRNAs are expressed ubiquitously in all tissues examined, whereas a few display tissue-specific expression. We predicted 46 genes as targets of the new rice miRNAs: 16 of these predicted targets encode transcription factors, and other target genes appear to play roles in diverse physiological processes. Four target genes have been experimentally verified by detection of miRNA-mediated mRNA cleavage. Our identification of new miRNAs in rice suggests that these miRNAs may have evolved independently in rice or been lost in other species."

Different combinations of microRNAs are expressed in different cell types and may coordinately regulate cell-specific target genes. Here, we present PicTar, a computational method for identifying common targets of microRNAs. Statistical tests using genome-wide alignments of eight vertebrate genomes, PicTar's ability to specifically recover published microRNA targets, and experimental validation of seven predicted targets suggest that PicTar has an excellent success rate in predicting targets for single microRNAs and for combinations of microRNAs. We find that vertebrate microRNAs target, on average, roughly 200 transcripts each. Furthermore, our results suggest widespread coordinate control executed by microRNAs. In particular, we experimentally validate common regulation of Mtpn by miR-375, miR-124 and let-7b and thus provide evidence for coordinate microRNA control in mammals."

        "title": "Specific effects of microRNAs on the plant transcriptome.",
        "abstract": "Most plant microRNAs (miRNAs) have perfect or near-perfect complementarity with their targets. This is consistent with their primary mode of action being cleavage of target mRNAs, similar to that induced by perfectly complementary small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). However, there are natural targets with up to five mismatches. Furthermore, artificial siRNAs can have substantial effects on so-called off-targets, to which they have only limited complementarity. By analyzing the transcriptome of plants overexpressing different miRNAs, we have deduced a set of empirical parameters for target recognition. Compared to artificial siRNAs, authentic plant miRNAs appear to have much higher specificity, which may reflect their coevolution with the remainder of the transcriptome. We also demonstrate that miR172, previously thought to act primarily by translational repression, can efficiently guide mRNA cleavage, although the effects on steady-state levels of target transcripts are obscured by strong feedback regulation. This finding unifies the view of plant miRNA action."

        "abstract": "Mammalian cells harbor numerous small non-protein-coding RNAs, including small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs), short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and small double-stranded RNAs, which regulate gene expression at many levels including chromatin architecture, RNA editing, RNA stability, translation, and quite possibly transcription and splicing. These RNAs are processed by multistep pathways from the introns and exons of longer primary transcripts, including protein-coding transcripts. Most show distinctive temporal- and tissue-specific expression patterns in different tissues, including embryonal stem cells and the brain, and some are imprinted. Small RNAs control a wide range of developmental and physiological pathways in animals, including hematopoietic differentiation, adipocyte differentiation and insulin secretion in mammals, and have been shown to be perturbed in cancer and other diseases. The extent of transcription of non-coding sequences and the abundance of small RNAs suggests the existence of an extensive regulatory network on the basis of RNA signaling which may underpin the development and much of the phenotypic variation in mammals and other complex organisms and which may have different genetic signatures from sequences encoding proteins."

        "abstract": "Argonautes (AGOs) are conserved proteins that contain an RNA-binding PAZ domain and an RNase H-like PIWI domain. In Arabidopsis, except for AGO1, AGO4 and AGO7, the roles of seven other AGOs in gene silencing are not known. We found that a mutation in AGO6 partially suppresses transcriptional gene silencing in the DNA demethylase mutant ros1-1. In ago6-1ros1-1 plants, RD29A promoter short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are less abundant, and cytosine methylation at both transgenic and endogenous RD29A promoters is reduced, compared to that in ros1-1. Interestingly, the ago4-1 mutation has a stronger suppression of the transcriptional silencing phenotype of ros1-1 mutant. Analysis of cytosine methylation at the endogenous MEA-ISR, AtREP2 and SIMPLEHAT2 loci revealed that the CpNpG and asymmetric methylation levels are lower in either of the ago6-1 and ago4-1 single mutants than those in the wild type, and the levels are the lowest in the ago6-1ago4-1 double mutant. These results suggest that AGO6 is important for the accumulation of specific heterochromatin-related siRNAs, and for DNA methylation and transcriptional gene silencing, this function is partly redundant with AGO4."

        "title": "Dynamic regulation of miRNA expression in ordered stages of cellular development.",
        "abstract": "Short RNA expression in several distinct stages of T-lymphocyte development was comprehensively profiled. The total number of microRNAs (miRNAs) expressed per cell at different stages of development varies over nearly an order of magnitude in parallel with changes in total cellular RNA content, suggesting that global miRNA levels are coregulated with the translational capacity of the cell. However, individual miRNAs were dynamically regulated during T-cell development, with at least one miRNA or miRNA family overrepresented at each developmental stage. miRNA regulation in this developmental pathway is characterized by analog rather than switch-like behavior, with temporal enrichments at distinct stages of development observed against a background of constant, basal expression of the miRNA. Enrichments of these miRNAs are temporally correlated with depletions of the transcript levels of targets containing seed matches to the specific miRNAs, and may have specific functional consequences. miR-181a, which is specifically enriched at the CD4(+)CD8(+) (DP) stage of thymocyte development, can repress the expression of Bcl-2, CD69, and the T-cell receptor, all of which are coordinately involved in positive selection."

        "abstract": "Drosophila Piwi-family proteins have been implicated in transposon control. Here, we examine piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) associated with each Drosophila Piwi protein and find that Piwi and Aubergine bind RNAs that are predominantly antisense to transposons, whereas Ago3 complexes contain predominantly sense piRNAs. As in mammals, the majority of Drosophila piRNAs are derived from discrete genomic loci. These loci comprise mainly defective transposon sequences, and some have previously been identified as master regulators of transposon activity. Our data suggest that heterochromatic piRNA loci interact with potentially active, euchromatic transposons to form an adaptive system for transposon control. Complementary relationships between sense and antisense piRNA populations suggest an amplification loop wherein each piRNA-directed cleavage event generates the 5' end of a new piRNA. Thus, sense piRNAs, formed following cleavage of transposon mRNAs may enhance production of antisense piRNAs, complementary to active elements, by directing cleavage of transcripts from master control loci."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are genomically encoded small non-coding RNAs that regulate flow of genetic information by controlling translation or stability of mRNAs. Recent recognition that many miRNAs are expressed in a tissue-specific manner during development of organisms, from worms to humans, has revealed a novel mechanism by which the proteome is regulated during the dynamic events of cell-lineage decisions and morphogenesis. Advances in the understanding of miRNA biogenesis, target recognition and participation in regulatory networks demonstrate a role for miRNAs in lineage decisions of progenitor cells and organogenesis. Future discoveries in this area are likely to reveal developmental-regulation and disease mechanisms related to miRNAs."

        "abstract": "New Zealand black (NZB) mice with autoimmune and B lymphoproliferative disease (B-LPD) are a model for human chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). A genomewide linkage scan of the NZB loci associated with lymphoma was conducted in F1 backcrosses of NZB and a control strain, DBA/2. Of 202 mice phenotyped for the presence or absence of LPD, surface maker expression, DNA content, and microsatellite polymorphisms, 74 had disease. The CD5(+), IgM(+), B220(dim), hyperdiploid LPD was linked to 3 loci on chromosomes 14, 18, and 19 that are distinct from previously identified autoimmunity-associated loci. The region of synteny with mouse D14mit160 is the human 13q14 region, associated with human CLL, containing microRNAs mir-15a16-1. DNA sequencing of multiple NZB tissues identified a point mutation in the 3' flanking sequence of the identical microRNA, mir-16-1, and this mutation was not present in other strains, including the nearest neighbor, NZW. Levels of miR-16 were decreased in NZB lymphoid tissue. Exogenous miR-16 delivered to an NZB malignant B-1 cell line resulted in cell-cycle alterations and increased apoptosis. Linkage of the mir-15a/16-1 complex and the development of B-LPD in this spontaneous mouse model suggest that the altered expression of the mir-15a/16-1 is the molecular lesion in CLL."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs are short, noncoding RNAs that play important roles in post-transcriptional gene regulation. Although many functions of microRNAs in plants and animals have been revealed in recent years, the transcriptional mechanism of microRNA genes is not well-understood. To elucidate the transcriptional regulation of microRNA genes, we study and characterize, in a genome scale, the promoters of intergenic microRNA genes in Caenorhabditis elegans, Homo sapiens, Arabidopsis thaliana, and Oryza sativa. We show that most known microRNA genes in these four species have the same type of promoters as protein-coding genes have. To further characterize the promoters of microRNA genes, we developed a novel promoter prediction method, called common query voting (CoVote), which is more effective than available promoter prediction methods. Using this new method, we identify putative core promoters of most known microRNA genes in the four model species. Moreover, we characterize the promoters of microRNA genes in these four species. We discover many significant, characteristic sequence motifs in these core promoters, several of which match or resemble the known cis-acting elements for transcription initiation. Among these motifs, some are conserved across different species while some are specific to microRNA genes of individual species."

        "abstract": "Microarrays to examine the global expression levels of microRNAs (miRNAs) in a systematic in-parallel manner have become important tools to help unravel the functions of miRNAs and to understand their roles in RNA-based regulation and their implications in human diseases. We have established a novel miRNA-specific microarray platform that enables the simultaneous expression analysis of both known and predicted miRNAs obtained from human or mouse origin. Chemically modified 2'-O-(2-methoxyethyl)-(MOE) oligoribonucleotide probes were arrayed onto Evanescent Resonance (ER) microchips by robotic spotting. Supplementing the complementary probes against miRNAs with carefully designed mismatch controls allowed for accurate sequence-specific determination of miRNA expression profiles obtained from a panel of mouse tissues. This revealed new expression signatures of known miRNAs as well as of novel miRNAs previously predicted using bioinformatic methods. Systematic confirmation of the array data with northern blotting and, in particular, real-time PCR suggests that the described microarray platform is a powerful tool to analyze miRNA expression patterns with rapid throughput and high fidelity."

Frequently, not only single miRNAs but whole families of closely related miRNAs have been found in animals and plants. Some families are widely conserved among different plant taxa. Hence, it is evident that these conserved miRNAs are of ancient origin and indicate essential functions that have been preserved over long evolutionary time scales. In contrast, other miRNAs seem to be species-specific and consequently must possess very distinct functions. Thus, the analysis of an early-branching species provides a window into the early evolution of fundamental regulatory processes in plants."

        "abstract": "In addition to the three RNA polymerases (RNAP I-III) shared by all eukaryotic organisms, plant genomes encode a fourth RNAP (RNAP IV) that appears to be specialized in the production of siRNAs. Available data support a model in which dsRNAs are generated by RNAP IV and RNA-dependent RNAP 2 (RDR2) and processed by DICER (DCL) enzymes into 21- to 24-nt siRNAs, which are associated with different ARGONAUTE (AGO) proteins for transcriptional or posttranscriptional gene silencing. However, it is not yet clear what fraction of genomic siRNA production is RNAP IV-dependent, and to what extent these siRNAs are preferentially processed by certain DCL(s) or associated with specific AGOs for distinct downstream functions. To address these questions on a genome-wide scale, we sequenced approximately 335,000 siRNAs from wild-type and RNAP IV mutant Arabidopsis plants by using 454 technology. The results show that RNAP IV is required for the production of >90% of all siRNAs, which are faithfully produced from a discrete set of genomic loci. Comparisons of these siRNAs with those accumulated in rdr2 and dcl2 dcl3 dcl4 and those associated with AGO1 and AGO4 provide important information regarding the processing, channeling, and functions of plant siRNAs. We also describe a class of RNAP IV-independent siRNAs produced from endogenous single-stranded hairpin RNA precursors."

Here we show that regulatory T (T reg) cells have a miRNA profile distinct from conventional CD4 T cells. A partial T reg cell-like miRNA profile is conferred by the enforced expression of Foxp3 and, surprisingly, by the activation of conventional CD4 T cells. Depleting miRNAs by eliminating Dicer, the RNAse III enzyme that generates functional miRNAs, reduces T reg cell numbers and results in immune pathology. Dicer facilitates, in a cell-autonomous fashion, the development of T reg cells in the thymus and the efficient induction of Foxp3 by transforming growth factor beta. These results suggest that T reg cell development involves Dicer-generated RNAs."

        "abstract": "Computational microRNA (miRNA) target prediction is a field in flux. Here we present a guide through five widely used mammalian target prediction programs. We include an analysis of the performance of these individual programs and of various combinations of these programs. For this analysis we compiled several benchmark data sets of experimentally supported miRNA-target gene interactions. Based on the results, we provide a discussion on the status of target prediction and also suggest a stepwise approach toward predicting and selecting miRNA targets for experimental testing."

        "abstract": "MicroRNA (miRNA) alterations are involved in the initiation and progression of human cancer. The causes of the widespread differential expression of miRNA genes in malignant compared with normal cells can be explained by the location of these genes in cancer-associated genomic regions, by epigenetic mechanisms and by alterations in the miRNA processing machinery. MiRNA-expression profiling of human tumours has identified signatures associated with diagnosis, staging, progression, prognosis and response to treatment. In addition, profiling has been exploited to identify miRNA genes that might represent downstream targets of activated oncogenic pathways, or that target protein-coding genes involved in cancer."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs of 19-24 nucleotides in length that downregulate gene expression during various crucial cell processes such as apoptosis, differentiation and development. Recent work supports a role for miRNAs in the initiation and progression of human malignancies. Large high-throughput studies in patients revealed that miRNA profiling have the potential to classify tumors with high accuracy and predict outcome. Functional studies, some of which involve animal models, indicate that miRNAs act as tumor suppressors and oncogenes. Here, we summarize miRNA-profiling studies in human malignancies and examine the role of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of cancer. We also discuss the implications of these findings for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs are small noncoding 18- to 24-nt RNAs that are predicted to regulate expression of as many as 30% of protein-encoding genes. In prostate adenocarcinoma, 39 microRNAs are up-regulated, and six microRNAs are down-regulated. Production and function of microRNA requires coordinated processing by proteins of the microRNA machinery. Dicer, an RNase III endonuclease, is an essential component of the microRNA machinery. From a gene array analysis of 16 normal prostate tissue samples, 64 organ-confined, and four metastatic prostate adenocarcinomas, we identified an up-regulation of major components of the microRNA machinery, including Dicer, in metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemical studies on a tissue microarray consisting of 232 prostate specimens confirmed up-regulation of Dicer in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and in 81% of prostate adenocarcinoma. The increased Dicer level in prostate adenocarcinoma correlated with clinical stage, lymph node status, and Gleason score. Western blot analysis of benign and neoplastic prostate cell lines further confirmed Dicer up-regulation in prostate adenocarcinoma. Dicer up-regulation may explain an almost global increase of microRNA expression in prostate adenocarcinoma. The presence of up-regulated microRNA machinery may predict the susceptibility of prostate adenocarcinoma to RNA interference-based therapy."

        "abstract": "RNA interference, mediated by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), is a conserved regulatory process that has evolved as an antiviral defense mechanism in plants and animals. It is not known whether host cells also use siRNAs as an antibacterial defense mechanism in eukaryotes. Here, we report the discovery of an endogenous siRNA, nat-siRNAATGB2, that is specifically induced by the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae carrying effector avrRpt2. We demonstrate that the biogenesis of this siRNA requires DCL1, HYL1, HEN1, RDR6, NRPD1A, and SGS3. Its induction also depends on the cognate host disease resistance gene RPS2 and the NDR1 gene that is required for RPS2-specified resistance. This siRNA contributes to RPS2-mediated race-specific disease resistance by repressing PPRL, a putative negative regulator of the RPS2 resistance pathway."

Many of the new miRNAs are not conserved beyond primates, indicating their recent origin, and some miRNAs seem species specific, whereas others are expanded in one species through duplication events. These data suggest that evolution of miRNAs is an ongoing process and that along with ancient, highly conserved miRNAs, there are a number of emerging miRNAs."

        "abstract": "A fundamental problem in biology is understanding how natural selection has shaped the evolution of gene regulation. Here we use SNP genotype data and techniques from population genetics to study an entire layer of short, cis-regulatory sites in the human genome. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small noncoding RNAs that post-transcriptionally repress mRNA through cis-regulatory sites in 3' UTRs. We show that negative selection in humans is stronger on computationally predicted conserved miRNA binding sites than on other conserved sequence motifs in 3' UTRs, thus providing independent support for the target prediction model and explicitly demonstrating the contribution of miRNAs to darwinian fitness. Our techniques extend to nonconserved miRNA binding sites, and we estimate that 30%-50% of these are functional when the mRNA and miRNA are endogenously coexpressed. As we show that polymorphisms in predicted miRNA binding sites are likely to be deleterious, they are candidates for causal variants of human disease. We believe that our approach can be extended to studying other classes of cis-regulatory sites."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are approximately 22 nucleotide non-coding RNA molecules that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally. Although aberrant expression of miRNAs in various human cancers suggests a role for miRNAs in tumorigenesis, it remains largely unclear as to whether knockdown of a specific miRNA affects tumor growth. In this study, we profiled miRNA expression in matched normal breast tissue and breast tumor tissues by TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction miRNA array methods. Consistent with previous findings, we found that miR-21 was highly overexpressed in breast tumors compared to the matched normal breast tissues among 157 human miRNAs analysed. To better evaluate the role of miR-21 in tumorigenesis, we transfected breast cancer MCF-7 cells with anti-miR-21 oligonucleotides and found that anti-miR-21 suppressed both cell growth in vitro and tumor growth in the xenograft mouse model. Furthermore, this anti-miR-21-mediated cell growth inhibition was associated with increased apoptosis and decreased cell proliferation, which could be in part owing to downregulation of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 in anti-miR-21-treated tumor cells. Together, these results suggest that miR-21 functions as an oncogene and modulates tumorigenesis through regulation of genes such as bcl-2 and thus, it may serve as a novel therapeutic target."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs are predicted to regulate thousands of mammalian genes, but relatively few targets have been experimentally validated and few microRNA loss-of-function phenotypes have been assigned. As an alternative to chemically modified antisense oligonucleotides, we developed microRNA inhibitors that can be expressed in cells, as RNAs produced from transgenes. Termed 'microRNA sponges', these competitive inhibitors are transcripts expressed from strong promoters, containing multiple, tandem binding sites to a microRNA of interest. When vectors encoding these sponges are transiently transfected into cultured cells, sponges derepress microRNA targets at least as strongly as chemically modified antisense oligonucleotides. They specifically inhibit microRNAs with a complementary heptameric seed, such that a single sponge can be used to block an entire microRNA seed family. RNA polymerase II promoter (Pol II)-driven sponges contain a fluorescence reporter gene for identification and sorting of sponge-treated cells. We envision the use of stably expressed sponges in animal models of disease and development."

In the case of single miRNA targeting, we developed a metric that integrates miRNA and mRNA expression data to calculate how changes in miRNA expression affect target mRNA expression. Using the metric, our global analysis shows that the repression of a given miRNA on a target mRNA is modulated by 3' untranslated region length, the number of target sites, and the distance between a pair of binding sites. Additionally, we show that some miRNAs preferentially repress transcripts with longer CTG repeats, suggesting a possible role for miRNAs in repeat expansion disorders such as myotonic dystrophy. We also examine the large class of genes targeted by multiple miRNAs and show that specific types of genes are progressively more enriched as the number of targeting miRNAs increases. Expression microarray data further show that these highly targeted genes are downregulated relative to genes targeted by few miRNAs, which suggests that highly targeted genes are tightly regulated and that their dysregulation may lead to disease. In support of this idea, cancer genes are strongly enriched among highly targeted genes."

        "abstract": "microRNAs (miRNAs) are noncoding small RNAs that regulate gene expression at the translational level by mainly interacting with 3' UTRs of their target mRNAs. Archived formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens represent excellent resources for biomarker discovery. Currently there is a lack of systematic analysis on the stability of miRNAs and optimized conditions for expression analysis using FFPE samples. In this study, the expression of miRNAs from FFPE samples was analyzed using high-throughput locked nucleic acid-based miRNA arrays. The effect of formalin fixation on the stability of miRNAs was also investigated using miRNA real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis. The stability of miRNAs of archived colorectal cancer FFPE specimens was characterized with samples dating back up to 10 yr. Our results showed that the expression profiles of miRNAs were in good correlation between 1 mug of fresh frozen and 1-5 mug of FFPE samples (correlation coefficient R (2) = 0.86-0.89). Different formalin fixation times did not change the stability of miRNAs based on real-time qRT-PCR analysis. There are no significant differences of representative miRNA expression among 40 colorectal cancer FFPE specimens. This study provides a foundation for miRNA investigation using FFPE samples in cancer and other types of diseases."

        "abstract": "Over the past two years, microarray technologies, large-scale small RNA and whole genome sequencing projects, and data mining have provided a wealth of information about the spectrum of miRNAs and miRNA targets present in different plant species and the alga Chlamydomonas. Such studies have shown that a number of key miRNA regulatory modules for plant development are conserved throughout the plant kingdom, suggesting that these programs were crucial to the colonization of land. New genetic and biochemical studies of miRNA pathways in Arabidopsis, the spatiotemporal expression patterns of several conserved miRNAs and their targets, and the characterization of mutations in Arabidopsis and maize have begun to reveal the functions of these ancient miRNA-regulated developmental programs. In addition to these conserved miRNAs, there are many clade and species-specific miRNAs, which have evolved more recently and whose functions are currently unknown."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNAs with diverse regulatory roles. The miR-124 miRNA is expressed in neurons in the developing and adult nervous system. Here we show that overexpression of miR-124 in differentiating mouse P19 cells promotes neurite outgrowth, while blocking miR-124 function delays neurite outgrowth and decreases acetylated alpha-tubulin. Altered neurite outgrowth also was observed in mouse primary cortical neurons when miR-124 expression was increased, or when miR-124 function was blocked. In uncommitted P19 cells, miR-124 expression led to disruption of actin filaments and stabilization of microtubules. Expression of miR-124 also decreased Cdc42 protein and affected the subcellular localization of Rac1, suggesting that miR-124 may act in part via alterations to members of the Rho GTPase family. Furthermore, constitutively active Cdc42 or Rac1 attenuated neurite outgrowth promoted by miR-124. To obtain a broader perspective, we identified mRNAs downregulated by miR-124 in P19 cells using microarrays. mRNAs for proteins involved in cytoskeletal regulation were enriched among mRNAs downregulated by miR-124. A miR-124 variant with an additional 5' base failed to promote neurite outgrowth and downregulated substantially different mRNAs. These results indicate that miR-124 contributes to the control of neurite outgrowth during neuronal differentiation, possibly by regulation of the cytoskeleton."

They have a simple structure in their mature form but carry enormous information that may regulate up to 90% of the human transcriptome. Furthermore, the multi-facets of a miRNA are tightly associated with diverse cellular proteins that make it broadly connected to various physiological and pathological processes. This review aims to examine miRNAs briefly from their biogenesis to their general functions with an emphasis on working mechanisms in regulation of their target mRNAs."

        "abstract": "The development and function of neuronal circuits within the brain are orchestrated by sophisticated gene regulatory mechanisms. Recently, microRNAs have emerged as a novel class of small RNAs that fine-tune protein synthesis. microRNAs are abundantly expressed in the vertebrate nervous system, where they contribute to the specification of neuronal cell identity. Moreover, microRNAs also play an important role in mature neurons. This review summarizes the current knowledge about the function of microRNAs in the nervous system with special emphasis on synapse formation and plasticity. The second part of this work will discuss the potential involvement of microRNAs in neurologic diseases. The study of brain microRNAs promises to expand our understanding of the mechanisms underlying higher cognitive functions and neurologic diseases."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs are a newly discovered class of short (approximately 22 nt) naturally occurring single-stranded RNA molecules that regulate the expression of target genes post-transcriptionally. Despite only being discovered 7 years ago, microRNAs have been implicated as key regulatory molecules in nearly every biological process examined so far and abnormal expression of microRNAs have been linked to many forms of disease including cancer where they can function as both tumour-suppressors and oncogenes. So why are microRNAs causing so much excitement? And will this excitement translate into new medical breakthroughs? This review attempts to answer these questions in the wider context of cancer, focusing on the role that microRNAs play in normal lymphoid development and malignancy."

To elucidate the biochemical mechanism of miRNA processing, we developed an in vitro miRNA processing assay using purified recombinant proteins. We find that DCL1 alone releases 21-nt short RNAs from dsRNA as well as synthetic miR167b precursor RNAs. However, correctly processed miRNAs constitute a minority of the cleavage products. We show that recombinant HYL1 and SE proteins accelerate the rate of DCL1-mediated cleavage of pre- and pri-miR167b substrates and promote accurate processing."

        "abstract": "Proteins containing the forkhead-associated domain (FHA) are known to act in biological processes such as DNA damage repair, protein degradation, and signal transduction. Here we report that DAWDLE (DDL), an FHA domain-containing protein in Arabidopsis, acts in the biogenesis of miRNAs and endogenous siRNAs. Unlike mutants of genes known to participate in the processing of miRNA precursors, such as dcl1, hyponastic leaves1, and serrate, ddl mutants show reduced levels of pri-miRNAs as well as mature miRNAs. Promoter activity of MIR genes, however, is not affected by ddl mutations. DDL is an RNA binding protein and is able to interact with DCL1. In addition, we found that SNIP1, the human homolog of DDL, is involved in miRNA biogenesis and interacts with Drosha. Therefore, we uncovered an evolutionarily conserved factor in miRNA biogenesis. We propose that DDL participates in miRNA biogenesis by facilitating DCL1 to access or recognize pri-miRNAs."

        "title": "let-7 microRNAs in development, stem cells and cancer.",
        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs, approximately 22 nucleotides in length, that repress target messenger RNAs (mRNAs) through an antisense mechanism. The let-7 miRNA was originally discovered in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, where it regulates cell proliferation and differentiation, but subsequent work has shown that both its sequence and its function are highly conserved in mammals. Recent results have now linked decreased let-7 expression to increased tumorigenicity and poor patient prognosis. Moreover, during normal development, accumulation of let-7 can be prevented by LIN28, a promoter of pluripotency. Based on these findings, we propose that let-7 regulates 'stemness' by repressing self-renewal and promoting differentiation in both normal development and cancer. A more complete understanding of its function will thus provide insights into these processes and might yield diagnostic and therapeutic advances for cancer treatment."

        "title": "Aberrant expression of oncogenic and tumor-suppressive microRNAs in cervical cancer is required for cancer cell growth.",
        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in cancer development. By cloning and sequencing of a HPV16(+) CaSki cell small RNA library, we isolated 174 miRNAs (including the novel miR-193c) which could be grouped into 46 different miRNA species, with miR-21, miR-24, miR-27a, and miR-205 being most abundant. We chose for further study 10 miRNAs according to their cloning frequency and associated their levels in 10 cervical cancer- or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia-derived cell lines. No correlation was observed between their expression with the presence or absence of an integrated or episomal HPV genome. All cell lines examined contained no detectable miR-143 and miR-145. HPV-infected cell lines expressed a different set of miRNAs when grown in organotypic raft cultured as compared to monolayer cell culture, including expression of miR-143 and miR-145. This suggests a correlation between miRNA expression and tissue differentiation. Using miRNA array analyses for age-matched normal cervix and cervical cancer tissues, in combination with northern blot verification, we identified significantly deregulated miRNAs in cervical cancer tissues, with miR-126, miR-143, and miR-145 downregulation and miR-15b, miR-16, miR-146a, and miR-155 upregulation. Functional studies showed that both miR-143 and miR-145 are suppressive to cell growth. When introduced into cell lines, miR-146a was found to promote cell proliferation. Collectively, our data indicate that downregulation of miR-143 and miR-145 and upregulation of miR-146a play a role in cervical carcinogenesis."

        "abstract": "Plant and animal viruses overcome host antiviral silencing by encoding diverse viral suppressors of RNA silencing (VSRs). Prior to the identification and characterization of their silencing suppression activities mostly in transgene silencing assays, plant VSRs were known to enhance virus accumulation in the inoculated protoplasts, promote cell-to-cell virus movement in the inoculated leaves, facilitate the phloem-dependent long-distance virus spread, and/or intensify disease symptoms in systemically infected tissues. Here we discuss how the various silencing suppression activities of VSRs may facilitate these distinct steps during plant infection and why VSRs may not play a direct role in eliciting disease symptoms by general impairments of host endogenous small RNA pathways. We also highlight many of the key questions still to be addressed on the role of viral suppression of antiviral silencing in plant infection."

        "abstract": "RNA interference (RNAi) is a gene silencing mechanism that has been conserved in evolution from yeast to man. Double stranded RNA, which is either expressed by cellular genes for small non-coding RNAs, by parasitic nucleic acids, such as viruses or transposons, or is expressed as an experimental tool, becomes processed into small RNAs, which induce gene silencing by a variety of different means. RNAi-induced gene silencing controls gene expression at all levels, including transcription, mRNA stability and translation. We are only beginning to understand the physiological roles of the RNAi pathway and the function of the many small non-coding RNA species, which are found in eukaryotic genomes. Here we review the known functions of genes in RNAi in various species, the experimental use and design of small RNAs as a genetic tool to dissect the function of mammalian genes and their potential as therapeutic agents to modulate gene expression in patients."

        "abstract": "Germ-line stem cells (GSCs) serve as the source for gametogenesis in diverse organisms. We cloned and characterized the Drosophila piwi gene and showed that it is required for the asymmetric division of GSCs to produce and maintain a daughter GSC but is not essential for the further differentiation of the committed daughter cell. Genetic mosaic and RNA in situ analyses suggest that piwi expression in adjacent somatic cells regulates GSC division. piwi encodes a highly basic novel protein, well conserved during evolution. We isolated piwi homologs in Caenorhabditis elegans and humans and also identified Arabidopsis piwi-like genes known to be required for meristem cell maintenance. Decreasing C. elegans piwi expression reduces the proliferation of GSC-equivalent cells. Thus, piwi represents a novel class of genes required for GSC division in diverse organisms."

        "title": "Role of Arabidopsis ARGONAUTE4 in RNA-directed DNA methylation triggered by inverted repeats.",
        "abstract": "In a number of organisms, transgenes containing transcribed inverted repeats (IRs) that produce hairpin RNA can trigger RNA-mediated silencing, which is associated with 21-24 nucleotide small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). In plants, IR-driven RNA silencing also causes extensive cytosine methylation of homologous DNA in both the transgene \"trigger\" and any other homologous DNA sequences--\"targets\". Endogenous genomic sequences, including transposable elements and repeated elements, are also subject to RNA-mediated silencing. The RNA silencing gene ARGONAUTE4 (AGO4) is required for maintenance of DNA methylation at several endogenous loci and for the establishment of methylation at the FWA gene. Here, we show that mutation of AGO4 substantially reduces the maintenance of DNA methylation triggered by IR transgenes, but AGO4 loss-of-function does not block the initiation of DNA methylation by IRs. AGO4 primarily affects non-CG methylation of the target sequences, while the IR trigger sequences lose methylation in all sequence contexts. Finally, we find that AGO4 and the DRM methyltransferase genes are required for maintenance of siRNAs at a subset of endogenous sequences, but AGO4 is not required for the accumulation of IR-induced siRNAs or a number of endogenous siRNAs, suggesting that AGO4 may function downstream of siRNA production."

        "abstract": "Dicer is a multidomain ribonuclease that processes double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) to 21 nt small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) during RNA interference, and excises microRNAs from precursor hairpins. Dicer contains two domains related to the bacterial dsRNA-specific endonuclease, RNase III, which is known to function as a homodimer. Based on an X-ray structure of the Aquifex aeolicus RNase III, models of the enzyme interaction with dsRNA, and its cleavage at two composite catalytic centers, have been proposed. We have generated mutations in human Dicer and Escherichia coli RNase III residues implicated in the catalysis, and studied their effect on RNA processing. Our results indicate that both enzymes have only one processing center, containing two RNA cleavage sites and generating products with 2 nt 3' overhangs. Based on these and other data, we propose that Dicer functions through intramolecular dimerization of its two RNase III domains, assisted by the flanking RNA binding domains, PAZ and dsRBD."

Here we detail a protocol to design and introduce into cultured Drosophila and human cells sequence-specific antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) that block the function of individual miRNAs. Coupled with recent studies that catalog the miRNAs expressed in diverse cultured cells, our method offers a rapid (<1 week) approach to validate miRNA targets and to study the cellular functions of individual human and Drosophila miRNAs. ASO-based inactivation of miRNAs is faster and simpler than comparable genetic or 'sponge'-based approaches, for which extensive recombinant DNA manipulation is required. We present our ASO design principles and an optimized transfection protocol in which transfection efficiency of Drosophila Schneider 2 cells can approach 100%. Our 3'-cholesterol-modified ASOs have enhanced potency, allowing miRNA inhibition for at least 7 d from a single transfection."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short RNAs that direct messenger RNA degradation or disrupt mRNA translation in a sequence-dependent manner. For more than a decade, attempts to study the interaction of miRNAs with their targets were confined to the 3' untranslated regions of mRNAs, fuelling an underlying assumption that these regions are the principal recipients of miRNA activity. Here we focus on the mouse Nanog, Oct4 (also known as Pou5f1) and Sox2 genes and demonstrate the existence of many naturally occurring miRNA targets in their amino acid coding sequence (CDS). Some of the mouse targets analysed do not contain the miRNA seed, whereas others span exon-exon junctions or are not conserved in the human and rhesus genomes. miR-134, miR-296 and miR-470, upregulated on retinoic-acid-induced differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells, target the CDS of each transcription factor in various combinations, leading to transcriptional and morphological changes characteristic of differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells, and resulting in a new phenotype. Silent mutations at the predicted targets abolish miRNA activity, prevent the downregulation of the corresponding genes and delay the induced phenotype. Our findings demonstrate the abundance of CDS-located miRNA targets, some of which can be species-specific, and support an augmented model whereby animal miRNAs exercise their control on mRNAs through targets that can reside beyond the 3' untranslated region."

        "title": "Mammalian microRNAs predominantly act to decrease target mRNA levels.",
        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous approximately 22-nucleotide RNAs that mediate important gene-regulatory events by pairing to the mRNAs of protein-coding genes to direct their repression. Repression of these regulatory targets leads to decreased translational efficiency and/or decreased mRNA levels, but the relative contributions of these two outcomes have been largely unknown, particularly for endogenous targets expressed at low-to-moderate levels. Here, we use ribosome profiling to measure the overall effects on protein production and compare these to simultaneously measured effects on mRNA levels. For both ectopic and endogenous miRNA regulatory interactions, lowered mRNA levels account for most (>/=84%) of the decreased protein production. These results show that changes in mRNA levels closely reflect the impact of miRNAs on gene expression and indicate that destabilization of target mRNAs is the predominant reason for reduced protein output."

        "abstract": "Imagine being able to knock out your favourite gene with only a day's work. Not just in one model system, but in virtually any organism: plants, flies, mice or cultured cells. This sort of experimental dream might one day become reality as we learn to harness the power of RNA interference, the process by which double-stranded RNA induces the silencing of homologous endogenous genes. How this phenomenon works is slowly becoming clear, and might help us to develop an effortless tool to probe gene function in cells and animals."

        "abstract": "Endogenous small RNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs) and short-interfering RNAs (siRNAs), function as post-transcriptional or transcriptional regulators in plants. miRNA function is essential for normal plant development and therefore is likely to be important in the growth of the rice grain. To investigate the roles of miRNAs in rice grain development, we carried out deep sequencing of the small RNA populations of rice grains at two developmental stages. In a data set of approximately 5.5 million sequences, we found representatives of all 20 conserved plant miRNA families. We used an approach based on the presence of miRNA and miRNA* sequences to identify 39 novel, nonconserved rice miRNA families expressed in grains. Cleavage of predicted target mRNAs was confirmed for a number of the new miRNAs. We identified a putative mirtron, indicating that plants may also use spliced introns as a source of miRNAs. We also identified a miRNA-like long hairpin that generates phased 21 nt small RNAs, strongly expressed in developing grains, and show that these small RNAs act in trans to cleave target mRNAs. Comparison of the population of miRNAs and miRNA-like siRNAs in grains to those in other parts of the rice plant reveals that many are expressed in an organ-specific manner."

        "abstract": "RNA interference is an evolutionarily conserved gene-silencing pathway in which the nuclease Dicer cleaves double-stranded RNA into small interfering RNAs. The biological function of the RNAi-related pathway in vertebrate cells is not fully understood. Here, we report the generation of a conditional loss-of-function Dicer mutant in a chicken-human hybrid DT40 cell line that contains human chromosome 21. We show that loss of Dicer results in cell death with the accumulation of abnormal mitotic cells that show premature sister chromatid separation. Aberrant accumulation of transcripts from alpha-satellite sequences, which consist of human centromeric repeat DNAs, was detected in Dicer-deficient cells. Immunocytochemical analysis revealed abnormalities in the localization of two heterochromatin proteins, Rad21 cohesin protein and BubR1 checkpoint protein, but the localization of core kinetochore proteins such as centromere protein (CENP)-A and -C was normal. We conclude that Dicer-related RNA interference machinery is involved in the formation of the heterochromatin structure in higher vertebrate cells."

        "title": "Dysregulation of microRNAs in cancer: playing with fire.",
        "abstract": "MicroRNAs have emerged as key post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression, involved in various physiological and pathological processes. It was found that several miRNAs are directly involved in human cancers, including lung, breast, brain, liver, colon cancer and leukemia. In addition, some miRNAs may function as oncogenes or tumor suppressors in tumor development. Furthermore, a widespread down-regulation of miRNAs is commonly observed in human cancers and promotes cellular transformation and tumorigenesis. More than 50% of miRNA genes are located in cancer-associated genomic regions or in fragile sites, frequently amplified or deleted in human cancer, suggesting an important role in malignant transformation. A better understanding of the miRNA regulation and misexpression in cancer may ultimately yield further insight into the molecular mechanisms of tumorigenesis and new therapeutic strategies may arise against cancer. Here, we discuss the occurrence of the deregulated expression of miRNAs in human cancers and their importance in the tumorigenic process."

        "title": "MicroRNA miR-21 overexpression in human breast cancer is associated with advanced clinical stage, lymph node metastasis and patient poor prognosis.",
        "abstract": "To investigate the global expression profile of miRNAs in primary breast cancer (BC) and normal adjacent tumor tissues (NATs) and its potential relevance to clinicopathological characteristics and patient survival, the genome-wide expression profiling of miRNAs in BC was investigated using a microarray containing 435 mature human miRNA oligonucleotide probes. Nine miRNAs of hsa-miR-21, hsa-miR-365, hsa-miR-181b, hsa-let-7f, hsa-miR-155, hsa-miR-29b, hsa-miR-181d, hsa-miR-98, and hsa-miR-29c were observed to be up-regulated greater than twofold in BC compared with NAT, whereas seven miRNAs of hsa-miR-497, hsa-miR-31, hsa-miR-355, hsa-miR-320, rno-mir-140, hsa-miR-127 and hsa-miR-30a-3p were observed to be down-regulated greater than twofold. The most significantly up-regulated miRNAs, hsa-mir-21 (miR-21), was quantitatively analyzed by TaqMan real-time PCR in 113 BC tumors. Interestingly, among the 113 BC cases, high level expression of miR-21 was significantly correlated with advanced clinical stage (P = 0.006, Fisher's exact text), lymph node metastasis (P = 0.007, Fisher's exact text), and shortened survival of the patients (hazard ratio [HR]=5.476, P < 0.001). Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed this prognostic impact (HR=4.133, P = 0.001) to be independent of disease stage (HR=2.226, P = 0.013) and histological grade (HR=3.681, P = 0.033). This study could identify the differentiated miRNAs expression profile in BC and reveal that miR-21 overexpression was correlated with specific breast cancer biopathologic features, such as advanced tumor stage, lymph node metastasis, and poor survival of the patients, indicating that miR-21 may serve as a molecular prognostic marker for BC and disease progression."

        "abstract": "Recognition sites for microRNAs (miRNAs) have been reported to be located in the 3' untranslated regions of transcripts. In a computational screen for highly conserved motifs within coding regions, we found an excess of sequences conserved at the nucleotide level within coding regions in the human genome, the highest scoring of which are enriched for miRNA target sequences. To validate our results, we experimentally demonstrated that the let-7 miRNA directly targets the miRNA-processing enzyme Dicer within its coding sequence, thus establishing a mechanism for a miRNA/Dicer autoregulatory negative feedback loop. We also found computational evidence to suggest that miRNA target sites in coding regions and 3' UTRs may differ in mechanism. This work demonstrates that miRNAs can directly target transcripts within their coding region in animals, and it suggests that a complete search for the regulatory targets of miRNAs should be expanded to include genes with recognition sites within their coding regions. As more genomes are sequenced, the methodological approach that we used for identifying motifs with high sequence conservation will be increasingly valuable for detecting functional sequence motifs within coding regions."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) and short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that have recently emerged as important regulators of mRNA degradation, translational repression, and chromatin modification. In Arabidopsis thaliana, 43 miRNAs comprising 15 families have been reported thus far. In an attempt to identify novel and abiotic stress regulated miRNAs and siRNAs, we constructed a library of small RNAs from Arabidopsis seedlings exposed to dehydration, salinity, or cold stress or to the plant stress hormone abscisic acid. Sequencing of the library and subsequent analysis revealed 26 new miRNAs from 34 loci, forming 15 new families. Two of the new miRNAs from three loci are members of previously reported miR171 and miR319 families. Some of the miRNAs are preferentially expressed in specific tissues, and several are either upregulated or downregulated by abiotic stresses. Ten of the miRNAs are highly conserved in other plant species. Fifty-one potential targets with diverse function were predicted for the newly identified miRNAs based on sequence complementarity. In addition to miRNAs, we identified 102 other novel endogenous small RNAs in Arabidopsis. These findings suggest that a large number of miRNAs and other small regulatory RNAs are encoded by the Arabidopsis genome and that some of them may play important roles in plant responses to environmental stresses as well as in development and genome maintenance."

        "abstract": "Systemic translocation of RNA exerts non-cell-autonomous control over plant development and defense. Long-distance delivery of mRNA has been proven, but transport of small interfering RNA and microRNA remains to be demonstrated. Analyses performed on phloem sap collected from a range of plants identified populations of small RNA species. The dynamic nature of this population was reflected in its response to growth conditions and viral infection. The authenticity of these phloem small RNA molecules was confirmed by bioinformatic analysis; potential targets for a set of phloem small RNA species were identified. Heterografting studies, using spontaneously silencing coat protein (CP) plant lines, also established that transgene-derived siRNA move in the long-distance phloem and initiate CP gene silencing in the scion. Biochemical analysis of pumpkin (Cucurbita maxima) phloem sap led to the characterization of C. maxima Phloem SMALL RNA BINDING PROTEIN1 (CmPSRP1), a unique component of the protein machinery probably involved in small RNA trafficking. Equivalently sized small RNA binding proteins were detected in phloem sap from cucumber (Cucumis sativus) and lupin (Lupinus albus). PSRP1 binds selectively to 25-nucleotide single-stranded RNA species. Microinjection studies provided direct evidence that PSRP1 could mediate the cell-to-cell trafficking of 25-nucleotide single-stranded, but not double-stranded, RNA molecules. The potential role played by PSRP1 in long-distance transmission of silencing signals is discussed with respect to the pathways and mechanisms used by plants to exert systemic control over developmental and physiological processes."

        "abstract": "miRNA populations, including mammalian homologues of lin-4 (mir-125) and let-7, undergo a marked transition during stem-cell differentiation. Originally identified on the basis of their mutational phenotypes in stem-cell maturation, mir-125 and let-7 are strongly induced during neural differentiation of embryonic stem (ES) cells and embryocarcinoma (EC) cells. We report that embryonic neural stem (NS) cells express let-7 and mir-125, and investigate post-transcriptional mechanisms contributing to the induction of let-7. We demonstrate that the pluripotency factor Lin-28 binds the pre-let-7 RNA and inhibits processing by the Dicer ribonuclease in ES and EC cells. In NS cells, Lin-28 is downregulated by mir-125 and let-7, allowing processing of pre-let-7 to proceed. Suppression of let-7 or mir-125 activity in NS cells led to upregulation of Lin-28 and loss of pre-let-7 processing activity, suggesting that let-7, mir-125 and lin-28 participate in an autoregulatory circuit that controls miRNA processing during NS-cell commitment."

        "title": "AtXRN4 degrades mRNA in Arabidopsis and its substrates include selected miRNA targets.",
        "abstract": "Messenger RNA degradation is an essential step in gene expression that can be regulated by siRNAs or miRNAs. However, most of our knowledge of in vivo eukaryotic mRNA degradation mechanisms derives from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which lacks miRNAs and RNAi capability. Using reverse genetic and microarray analyses, we have identified multiple substrates of AtXRN4, the Arabidopsis homolog of the major yeast mRNA degrading exoribonuclease, Xrn1p. Insertional mutation of AtXRN4 leads to accumulation of the 3' end of several mRNAs, in a manner that correlates with increased stability of the 3' end, and is reversed following complementation with AtXRN4. Moreover, 3' products of miRNA-mediated cleavage of SCARECROW-LIKE transcripts and several other miRNA target transcripts are among those that accumulate in xrn4 mutants. The demonstration that an Xrn1p homolog degrades mRNA in a multicellular eukaryote and contributes to the miRNA-mediated decay pathway of selected targets has implications for XRNs in other organisms."

        "title": "Human Argonaute2 mediates RNA cleavage targeted by miRNAs and siRNAs.",
        "abstract": "Argonaute proteins associate with small RNAs that guide mRNA degradation, translational repression, or a combination of both. The human Argonaute family has eight members, four of which (Ago1 through Ago4) are closely related and coexpressed in many cell types. To understand the biological function of the different Ago proteins, we set out to determine if Ago1 through Ago4 are associated with miRNAs as well as RISC activity in human cell lines. Our results suggest that miRNAs are incorporated indiscriminately of their sequence into Ago1 through Ago4 containing microRNPs (miRNPs). Purification of the FLAG/HA-epitope-tagged Ago containing complexes from different human cell lines revealed that endonuclease activity is exclusively associated with Ago2. Exogenously introduced siRNAs also associate with Ago2 for guiding target RNA cleavage. The specific role of Ago2 in guiding target RNA cleavage was confirmed independently by siRNA-based depletion of individual Ago members in combination with a sensitive positive-readout reporter assay."

        "abstract": "Within the past few years, studies on microRNA (miRNA) and cancer have burst onto the scene. Profiling of the miRNome (global miRNA expression levels) has become prevalent, and abundant miRNome data are currently available for various cancers. The pattern of miRNA expression can be correlated with cancer type, stage, and other clinical variables, so miRNA profiling can be used as a tool for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. miRNA expression analyses also suggest oncogenic (or tumor-suppressive) roles of miRNAs. miRNAs play roles in almost all aspects of cancer biology, such as proliferation, apoptosis, invasion/metastasis, and angiogenesis. Given that many miRNAs are deregulated in cancers but have not yet been further studied, it is expected that more miRNAs will emerge as players in the etiology and progression of cancer. Here we also discuss miRNAs as a tool for cancer therapy."

        "title": "Functional parameters of Dicer-independent microRNA biogenesis.",
        "abstract": "Until recently, a Dicer-class RNase III enzyme was believed to be essential for microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis in all animals. The conserved vertebrate locus mir-451 defies this expectation and instead matures by direct cleavage of its pre-miRNA hairpin via the Slicer activity of Argonaute2 (Ago2). In this study, we used structure-function analysis to define the functional parameters of Ago2-mediated miRNA biogenesis. These include (1) the requirement for base-pairing at most, but not all, positions within the pre-mir-451 stem; (2) surprisingly little influence of the 5'-nucleotide on Ago sorting; (3) substantial influence of Ago protein stoichiometry on mir-451 maturation; (4) strong influence of G:C content in the distal stem on 3' resection of cleaved mir-451 substrates; and (5) the influence of hairpin length on substrate utilization by Ago2 and Dicer. Unexpectedly, we find that certain hairpin lengths confer competence to mature via both Dicer-mediated and Ago2-mediated pathways, and we show, in fact, that a conventional shRNA can traverse the Dicer-independent pathway. Altogether, these data inform the design of effective Dicer-independent substrates for gene silencing and reveal novel aspects of substrate handling by Ago proteins."

        "abstract": "In bilaterian animals, such as humans, flies and worms, hundreds of microRNAs (miRNAs), some conserved throughout bilaterian evolution, collectively regulate a substantial fraction of the transcriptome. In addition to miRNAs, other bilaterian small RNAs, known as Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), protect the genome from transposons. Here we identify small RNAs from animal phyla that diverged before the emergence of the Bilateria. The cnidarian Nematostella vectensis (starlet sea anemone), a close relative to the Bilateria, possesses an extensive repertoire of miRNA genes, two classes of piRNAs and a complement of proteins specific to small-RNA biology comparable to that of humans. The poriferan Amphimedon queenslandica (sponge), one of the simplest animals and a distant relative of the Bilateria, also possesses miRNAs, both classes of piRNAs and a full complement of the small-RNA machinery. Animal miRNA evolution seems to have been relatively dynamic, with precursor sizes and mature miRNA sequences differing greatly between poriferans, cnidarians and bilaterians. Nonetheless, miRNAs and piRNAs have been available as classes of riboregulators to shape gene expression throughout the evolution and radiation of animal phyla."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs are endogenously produced 21-nt riboregulators that associate with ARGONAUTE (AGO) proteins to direct mRNA cleavage or repress translation of complementary RNAs. In addition to protein-coding gene repression, miRNA-directed regulation of non-protein-coding transcripts can incite production of trans-acting siRNA (tasiRNA) populations that themselves direct mRNA repression. Arabidopsis encodes 10 AGO proteins among which, AGO1, AGO7, and AGO10 have been implicated in miRNA-guided gene repression in vivo. Recent work has shown that AGO proteins discriminate their associated small RNA populations on the basis of size and 5'-terminal nucleotide identity, extending the roles of AGO proteins beyond small RNA action. Our expanding appreciation of miRNA-directed regulation during plant development and stress adaptations has placed miRNAs at the forefront of plant biology."

Accumulating evidence shows that aberrantly expressed miRNAs play important roles in human cancers and underscores them as potential targets for therapeutic intervention. Basic research has provided strong evidence about the role of miRNA as oncogenes and as tumor suppressor genes in cancer. In accord with this finding, miRNA-based cancer therapy is a very interesting field of investigation that offers the appeal of targeting multiple gene networks controlled by a single, aberrantly expressed miRNA. A new door in cancer research is opening and it may lead to the modulation of miRNAs."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are crucial for normal embryonic stem (ES) cell self-renewal and cellular differentiation, but how miRNA gene expression is controlled by the key transcriptional regulators of ES cells has not been established. We describe here the transcriptional regulatory circuitry of ES cells that incorporates protein-coding and miRNA genes based on high-resolution ChIP-seq data, systematic identification of miRNA promoters, and quantitative sequencing of short transcripts in multiple cell types. We find that the key ES cell transcription factors are associated with promoters for miRNAs that are preferentially expressed in ES cells and with promoters for a set of silent miRNA genes. This silent set of miRNA genes is co-occupied by Polycomb group proteins in ES cells and shows tissue-specific expression in differentiated cells. These data reveal how key ES cell transcription factors promote the ES cell miRNA expression program and integrate miRNAs into the regulatory circuitry controlling ES cell identity."

        "title": "Small noncoding RNAs: biogenesis, function, and emerging significance in toxicology.",
        "abstract": "In recent years, the discovery of small ncRNAs (noncoding RNAs) has unveiled a slew of powerful riboregulators of gene expression. So far, many different types of small ncRNAs have been described. Of these, miRNAs (microRNAs), siRNAs (small interfering RNAs), and piRNAs (Piwi-interacting RNAs) have been studied in more detail. A significant fraction of genes in most organisms and tissues is targets of these small ncRNAs. Because these tiny RNAs are turning out to be important regulators of gene and genome expression, their aberrant expression profiles are expected to be associated with cellular dysfunction and disease. In fact, an ever-increasing number of studies have implicated miRNAs and siRNAs in human health and disease ranging from metabolic disorders to diseases of various organ systems as well as various forms of cancer. Nevertheless, despite the flurry of research on these small ncRNAs, many aspects of their biology still remain to be understood. The following discussion focuses on some aspects of the biogenesis and function of small ncRNAs with major emphasis on miRNAs since these are the most widespread endogenous small ncRNAs that have been called \"micromanagers\" of gene expression. Their emerging significance in toxicology is also discussed."

        "title": "Emerging role of small ribonucleic acids in gastrointestinal tumors.",
        "abstract": "Small regulatory ribonucleic acids (RNAs) are recently recognized as being connected with a growing list of common diseases such as: cancer, heart disease, diabetes and inflammation and to date more than 5,000 publications are recorded on PubMed alone. Specific pathways generate each class of RNAs and their activities converge in the process of silence interference. In gastrointestinal malignancies microRNAs are deregulated, sometimes found in higher or lower levels depending on the type of malignancy and stage of the disease, functioning either as tumor suppressors or as oncogenes they interact forming regulatory loops with known transcription factors and signaling pathways. MiRNAs extracted from archived tissue biopsies can be used effectively as diagnostic, prognostic tools and molecular markers because they are stable over time and resistant to RNAse degradation. The distinct physiology of small RNAs may translate in more targeted cancer therapies in the near future."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, noncoding RNAs that influence diverse biological outcomes through the repression of target genes during normal development and pathological responses. In particular, the alteration of miRNA expression has dramatic consequences for the progression of tumorigenesis. miRNAs undergo two processing steps that transform a long primary transcript into the mature miRNA. Although the general miRNA biogenesis pathway is well established, it is clear that not all miRNAs are created equally. Recent studies show that miRNA expression is controlled by diverse mechanisms in response to cellular stimuli. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms that govern the regulation of miRNA biogenesis with particular focus on how these mechanisms are perturbed in cancer."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression by binding to complementary target mRNAs and either promoting their decay or inhibiting their translation. Most eukaryotic genomes studied encode miRNAs, which are processed from longer noncoding transcripts through pathways conserved from fungi to plants to animals. miRNAs are now understood to be key mediators of developmental transitions in a number of model organisms. With respect to the immune system, miRNAs affect all facets of immune system development, from hematopoiesis to activation in response to infection during both the innate and the adaptive immune response. At the same time, miRNA dysregulation is a central event in the development and pathophysiology of a number of cancers of the immune system. Here we will discuss our current understanding of this general regulatory mechanism, focusing on its involvement in inflammation and in oncogenesis."

        "abstract": "Progressive cell loss due to apoptosis is a pathological hallmark implicated in a wide spectrum of degenerative diseases such as heart disease, atherosclerotic arteries and hypertensive vessels, Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. Tremendous efforts have been made to improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways involved in apoptosistic cell death. Once ignored completely or overlooked as cellular detritus, microRNAs (miRNAs) that were discovered only a decade ago, have recently taken many by surprise. The importance of miRNAs has steadily gained appreciation and miRNA biology has exploded into a massive swell of interest with enormous range and potential in almost every biological discipline because of their widespread expression and diverse functions in both animals and humans. It has been established that miRNAs are critical regulators of apoptosis of various cell types. These small molecules act by repressing the expression of either the proapoptotic or antiapoptotic genes to produce antiapoptotic or proapoptotic effects. Appealing evidence has been accumulating for the involvement of miRNAs in human diseases associated with apoptotic cell death and the potential of miRNAs as novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of the diseases. This editorial aims to convey this message and to boost up the research interest by providing a timely, comprehensive overview on regulation of apoptosis by miRNAs and a synopsis on the pathophysiologic implications of this novel regulatory network based on the currently available data in the literature. It begins with a brief introduction to apoptosis and miRNAs, followed by the description of the fundamental aspects of miRNA biogenesis and action, and the role of miRNAs in regulating apoptosis of cancer cells and cardiovascular cells. Speculations on the development of miRNAs as potential therapeutic targets are also presented. Remarks are also provided to point out the unanswered questions and to outline the new directions for the future research of the field."

        "abstract": "miRNAs function as a critical regulatory layer in development, differentiation, and the maintenance of cell fate. Depletion of miRNAs from embryonic stem cells impairs their differentiation capacity. Total elimination of miRNAs leads to premature senescence in normal cells and tissues through activation of the DNA-damage checkpoint, whereas ablation of miRNAs in cancer cell lines results in an opposite effect, enhancing their tumorigenic potential. Here we compile evidence from the literature that point at miRNAs as key players in the maintenance of genomic integrity and proper cell fate. There is an apparent gap between our understanding of the subtle way by which miRNAs modulate protein levels, and their profound impact on cell fate. We propose that examining miRNAs in the context of the regulatory transcriptional and post-transcriptional networks they are embedded in may provide a broader view of their role in controlling cell fate."

        "abstract": "Drug resistance remains a major problem in the treatment of cancer patients for both conventional chemotherapeutic and novel biological agents. Intrinsic or acquired resistance can be caused by a range of mechanisms, including increased drug elimination, decreased drug uptake, drug inactivation and alterations of drug targets. Recent data showed that other than by genetic (mutation, amplification) and epigenetic (DNA hypermethylation, histone post-translational modification) changes, drug resistance mechanisms might also be regulated by microRNAs (miRNAs). In this review we provide an overview on the role of miRNAs in anticancer drug resistance, reporting the main studies on alterations in cell survival and/or apoptosis pathways, as well as in drug targets and determinants of drug metabolism, mediated by deregulation of miRNA expression. The current status of pharmacogenetic studies on miRNA and their possible role in cancer stem cell drug resistance are also discussed. Finally, we integrated the preclinical data with clinical evidences, in lung and pancreatic cancers, showing how the study of miRNAs could help to predict resistance of individual tumours to different anticancer drugs, and guide the oncologists in the selection of rationally based tailor-made treatments."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) represent an elegant mechanism of posttranscriptional control of gene expression that serves to fine-tune biological processes. These tiny noncoding RNAs (20-22 nucleotide) bind to the 3' untranslated region of mRNAs, thereby repressing gene expression. Recent advances in the understanding of lipid metabolism have revealed that miRNAs, particularly miR-122 and miR-33, play major roles in regulating cholesterol and fatty acid homeostasis. miR-122, the most abundant miRNA in the liver, appears to maintain the hepatic cell phenotype, and its inhibition decreases total serum cholesterol. miR-33, an intronic miRNA located with the sterol response element-binding protein (SREBP)-2 gene, regulates cholesterol efflux, fatty acid \u03b2 oxidation, and high-density lipoprotein metabolism. These findings have highlighted the complexity of lipid homeostasis and the important role that miRNAs play in these processes, potentially opening new avenues for the treatment of dyslipidemias."

        "title": "Viral induction and suppression of RNA silencing in plants.",
        "abstract": "RNA silencing in plants and insects can function as a defence mechanism against invading viruses. RNA silencing-based antiviral defence entails the production of virus-derived small interfering RNAs which guide specific antiviral effector complexes to inactivate viral genomes. As a response to this defence system, viruses have evolved viral suppressors of RNA silencing (VSRs) to overcome the host defence. VSRs can act on various steps of the different silencing pathways. Viral infection can have a profound impact on the host endogenous RNA silencing regulatory pathways; alterations of endogenous short RNA expression profile and gene expression are often associated with viral infections and their symptoms. Here we discuss our current understanding of the main steps of RNA-silencing responses to viral invasion in plants and the effects of VSRs on endogenous pathways.

        "abstract": "Consistent with the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in down-regulating gene expression by reducing the translation and/or stability of target messenger RNAs, the levels of specific miRNAs are important for correct embryonic development and have been linked to several forms of cancer. However, the regulatory mechanisms by which primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs) are processed first to precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) and then to mature miRNAs by the multiprotein Drosha and Dicer complexes, respectively, remain largely unknown. The KH-type splicing regulatory protein (KSRP, also known as KHSRP) interacts with single-strand AU-rich-element-containing mRNAs and is a key mediator of mRNA decay. Here we show in mammalian cells that KSRP also serves as a component of both Drosha and Dicer complexes and regulates the biogenesis of a subset of miRNAs. KSRP binds with high affinity to the terminal loop of the target miRNA precursors and promotes their maturation. This mechanism is required for specific changes in target mRNA expression that affect specific biological programs, including proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation. These findings reveal an unexpected mechanism that links KSRP to the machinery regulating maturation of a cohort of miRNAs that, in addition to its role in promoting mRNA decay, independently serves to integrate specific regulatory programs of protein expression."

        "title": "Use of dsRNA-mediated genetic interference to demonstrate that frizzled and frizzled 2 act in the wingless pathway.",
        "abstract": "We investigated the potential of double-stranded RNA to interfere with the function of genes in Drosophila. Injection of dsRNA into embryos resulted in potent and specific interference of several genes that were tested. In contrast, single-stranded RNA weakly interfered with gene activity. The method was used to determine the reception mechanism of the morphogen Wingless. Interference of the frizzled and Drosophila frizzled 2 genes together produced defects in embryonic patterning that mimic loss of wingless function. Interference of either gene alone had no effect on patterning. Epistasis analysis indicates that frizzled and Drosophila frizzled 2 act downstream of wingless and upstream of zeste-white3 in the Wingless pathway. Our results demonstrate that dsRNA interference can be used to analyze many aspects of gene function."

        "title": "A cyclin D1/microRNA 17/20 regulatory feedback loop in control of breast cancer cell proliferation.",
        "abstract": "Decreased expression of specific microRNAs (miRNAs) occurs in human tumors, which suggests a function for miRNAs in tumor suppression. Herein, levels of the miR-17-5p/miR-20a miRNA cluster were inversely correlated to cyclin D1 abundance in human breast tumors and cell lines. MiR-17/20 suppressed breast cancer cell proliferation and tumor colony formation by negatively regulating cyclin D1 translation via a conserved 3' untranslated region miRNA-binding site, thereby inhibiting serum-induced S phase entry. The cell cycle effect of miR-17/20 was abrogated by cyclin D1 siRNA and in cyclin D1-deficient breast cancer cells. Mammary epithelial cell-targeted cyclin D1 expression induced miR-17-5p and miR-20a expression in vivo, and cyclin D1 bound the miR-17/20 cluster promoter regulatory region. In summary, these studies identify a novel cyclin D1/miR-17/20 regulatory feedback loop through which cyclin D1 induces miR-17-5p/miR-20a. In turn, miR-17/20 limits the proliferative function of cyclin D1, thus linking expression of a specific miRNA cluster to the regulation of oncogenesis."

        "abstract": "Several lines of evidence indicate that the adaxial leaf domain possesses a unique competence to form shoot apical meristems. Factors required for this competence are expected to cause a defect in shoot apical meristem formation when inactivated and to be expressed or active preferentially in the adaxial leaf domain. PINHEAD, a member of a family of proteins that includes the translation factor eIF2C, is required for reliable formation of primary and axillary shoot apical meristems. In addition to high-level expression in the vasculature, we find that low-level PINHEAD expression defines a novel domain of positional identity in the plant. This domain consists of adaxial leaf primordia and the meristem. These findings suggest that the PINHEAD gene product may be a component of a hypothetical meristem forming competence factor. We also describe defects in floral organ number and shape, as well as aberrant embryo and ovule development associated with pinhead mutants, thus elaborating on the role of PINHEAD in Arabidopsis development. In addition, we find that embryos doubly mutant for PINHEAD and ARGONAUTE1, a related, ubiquitously expressed family member, fail to progress to bilateral symmetry and do not accumulate the SHOOT MERISTEMLESS protein. Therefore PINHEAD and ARGONAUTE1 together act to allow wild-type growth and gene expression patterns during embryogenesis."

Recent reports have revealed that the deregulation of miRNAs correlates with various human cancers and is involved in the initiation and progression of human cancers. miRNAs can act as oncogenes or tumor suppressors to inhibit the expression of cancer-related target genes and to promote or suppress tumorigenesis in various tissues. Therefore, abnormal miRNA expression can be regarded as a common feature of human cancers, and the identification of miRNAs and their respective targets may provide potential diagnostic and prognostic tumor biomarkers and new therapeutic strategies to treat cancers. In the present review, we discuss the emerging roles of miRNAs in the hallmarks of human cancers."

        "title": "Transfection of small RNAs globally perturbs gene regulation by endogenous microRNAs.",
        "abstract": "Transfection of small RNAs (such as small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs)) into cells typically lowers expression of many genes. Unexpectedly, increased expression of genes also occurs. We investigated whether this upregulation results from a saturation effect--that is, competition among the transfected small RNAs and the endogenous pool of miRNAs for the intracellular machinery that processes small RNAs. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed genome-wide transcript responses from 151 published transfection experiments in seven different human cell types. We show that targets of endogenous miRNAs are expressed at significantly higher levels after transfection, consistent with impaired effectiveness of endogenous miRNA repression. This effect exhibited concentration and temporal dependence. Notably, the profile of endogenous miRNAs can be largely inferred by correlating miRNA sites with gene expression changes after transfections. The competition and saturation effects have practical implications for miRNA target prediction, the design of siRNA and short hairpin RNA (shRNA) genomic screens and siRNA therapeutics."

        "abstract": "RNA interference (RNAi) is a mechanism that regulates genes by either transcriptional (TGS) or posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS), required for genome maintenance and proper development of an organism. Small non-coding RNAs are the key players in RNAi and have been intensively studied in eukaryotes. In plants, several classes of small RNAs with specific sizes and dedicated functions have evolved. The major classes of small RNAs include microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which differ in their biogenesis. miRNAs are synthesized from a short hairpin structure while siRNAs are derived from long double-stranded RNAs (dsRNA). Both miRNA and siRNAs control the expression of cognate target RNAs by binding to reverse complementary sequences mediating cleavage or translational inhibition of the target RNA. They also act on the DNA and cause epigenetic changes such as DNA methylation and histone modifications. In the last years, the analysis of plant RNAi pathways was extended to the bryophyte Physcomitrella patens, a non-flowering, non-vascular ancient land plant that diverged from the lineage of seed plants approximately 450 million years ago. Based on a number of characteristic features and its phylogenetic key position in land plant evolution P. patens emerged as a plant model species to address basic as well as applied topics in plant biology. Here we summarize the current knowledge on the role of RNAi in P. patens that shows functional overlap with RNAi pathways from seed plants, and also unique features specific to this species."

        "abstract": "Since their discovery, microRNAs (miRNA) have been implicated in a vast array of biological processes in animals, from fundamental developmental functions including cellular proliferation and differentiation, to more complex and specialized roles such as long-term potentiation and synapse-specific modifications in neurons. This review recounts the history behind this paradigm shift, which has seen small non-coding RNA molecules coming to the forefront of molecular biology, and introduces their role in establishing developmental complexity in animals. The fundamental mechanisms of miRNA biogenesis and function are then considered, leading into a discussion of recent discoveries transforming our understanding of how these molecules regulate gene network behaviour throughout developmental and pathophysiological processes. The emerging complexity of this mechanism is also examined with respect to the influence of cellular context on miRNA function. This discussion highlights the absolute imperative for experimental designs to appreciate the significance of context-specific factors when determining what genes are regulated by a particular miRNA. Moreover, by establishing the timing, location, and mechanism of these regulatory events, we may ultimately understand the true biological function of a specific miRNA in a given cellular environment."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNA guide molecules that regulate gene expression via association with effector complexes and sequence-specific recognition of target sites on other RNAs; misregulated microRNA expression and functions are linked to a variety of tumors, developmental disorders, and immune disease. MicroRNAs have primarily been demonstrated to mediate posttranscriptional downregulation of expression; translational repression, and deadenylation-dependent decay of messages through partially complementary microRNA target sites in mRNA untranslated regions (UTRs). However, an emerging assortment of studies, discussed in this review, reveal that microRNAs and their associated protein complexes (microribonucleoproteins or microRNPs) can additionally function to posttranscriptionally stimulate gene expression by direct and indirect mechanisms. These reports indicate that microRNA-mediated effects can be selective, regulated by the RNA sequence context, and associated with RNP factors and cellular conditions. Like repression, translation upregulation by microRNAs has been observed to range from fine-tuning effects to significant alterations in expression. These studies uncover remarkable, new abilities of microRNAs and associated microRNPs in gene expression control and underscore the importance of regulation, in cis and trans, in directing appropriate microRNP responses."

        "abstract": "Higher eukaryotes employ extensive post-transcriptional gene regulation to accomplish fine control of gene expression. The microRNA (miRNA) family plays important roles in the post-transcriptional gene regulation of broad networks of target mRNA expression. Most miRNAs are generated by a conserved mechanism involving two RNase III enzymes Drosha and Dicer. However, work from the past few years has uncovered diverse noncanonical miRNA pathways, which exploit a variety of other RNA processing enzymes. In addition, the discovery of another abundant small RNA family, endogenous short interfering RNAs (endo-siRNAs), has also broadened the catalogs of short regulatory RNAs. This review highlights recent studies that revealed novel small RNA biogenesis pathways, and discusses their relevance to gene regulatory networks."

The ancient origin of miRNAs, their dramatic expansion in bilaterian animals and their function in providing robustness to transcriptional programmes suggest that miRNAs are instrumental in the evolution of organismal complexity. Advances in understanding miRNA biology, combined with the increasing availability of diverse sequenced genomes, have begun to reveal the molecular mechanisms that underlie the evolution of miRNAs and their targets.

        "title": "Ribosome profiling shows that miR-430 reduces translation before causing mRNA decay in zebrafish.",
        "abstract": "MicroRNAs regulate gene expression through deadenylation, repression, and messenger RNA (mRNA) decay. However, the contribution of each mechanism in non-steady-state situations remains unclear. We monitored the impact of miR-430 on ribosome occupancy of endogenous mRNAs in wild-type and dicer mutant zebrafish embryos and found that miR-430 reduces the number of ribosomes on target mRNAs before causing mRNA decay. Translational repression occurs before complete deadenylation, and disrupting deadenylation with use of an internal polyadenylate tail did not block target repression. Lastly, we observed that ribosome density along the length of the message remains constant, suggesting that translational repression occurs by reducing the rate of initiation rather than affecting elongation or causing ribosomal drop-off. These results show that miR-430 regulates translation initiation before inducing mRNA decay during zebrafish development."

        "abstract": "Disease is often the result of an aberrant or inadequate response to physiologic and pathophysiologic stress. Studies over the last 10 years have uncovered a recurring paradigm in which microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate cellular behavior under these conditions, suggesting an especially significant role for these small RNAs in pathologic settings. Here, we review emerging principles of miRNA regulation of stress signaling pathways and apply these concepts to our understanding of the roles of miRNAs in disease. These discussions further highlight the unique challenges and opportunities associated with the mechanistic dissection of miRNA functions and the development of miRNA-based therapeutics."

Among all the species of non-coding RNAs, small non-coding RNAs (miRNAs, siRNAs and piRNAs) have been shown to be in the core of the regulatory machinery of all the genomic output in eukaryotic cells. Small non-coding RNAs are produced by several pathways containing specialized enzymes that process RNA transcripts. The mechanism of action of these molecules is also ensured by a group of effector proteins that are commonly engaged within high molecular weight protein-RNA complexes. In the last decade, the contribution of structural biology has been essential to the dissection of the molecular mechanisms involved in the biosynthesis and function of small non-coding RNAs."

        "abstract": "miRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that have emerged as crucial post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression. They are key players in various critical cellular processes such as proliferation, cell cycle progression, apoptosis and differentiation. Self-renewal capacity and differentiation potential are hallmarks of stem cells. The switch between self-renewal and differentiation requires rapid widespread changes in gene expression. Since miRNAs can repress the translation of many mRNA targets, they are good candidates to regulate cell fates. In the past few years, miRNAs have appeared as important new actors in stem cell development by regulating differentiation and maintenance of stem cells. In this chapter we will focus on the role of miRNAs in various stem cell populations. After an introduction on microRNA biogenesis, we will review the recent knowledge on miRNA expression and function in pluripotent cells and during the acquisition of stem cell fate. We will then briefly examine the role of miRNAs in adult and cancer stem cells."

        "abstract": "Developments in the field of molecular biology and genetics, such as microarray, gene transfer and discovery of small regulatory RNAs, have led to significant advances in plant biotechnology. Among the small RNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs) have elicited much interest as key post-transcriptional regulators in eukaryotic gene expression. Advances in genome and transcriptome sequencing of plants have facilitated the generation of a huge wealth of sequence information that can find much use in the discovery of novel miRNAs and their target genes. In this review, we present an overview of the developments in the strategies and methods used to identify and study miRNAs, their target genes and the mechanisms by which these miRNAs interact with their target genes since the discovery of the first miRNA. The approaches discussed include both reverse and forward genetics. We observed that despite the availability of advanced methods, certain limitations ranging from the cost of materials, equipment and personnel to the availability of genome sequences for many plant species present a number of challenges for the development and utilization of modern scientific methods for the elucidation and development of miRNAs in many important plant species."

Regulation of mature miRNA levels is critical in development, differentiation, and disease, as demonstrated by multiple levels of control during their biogenesis cascade. Here, we will focus on post-transcriptional mechanisms and will discuss the impact of -acting sequences in precursor miRNAs, as well as -acting factors that bind to these precursors and influence their processing.

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs are extensively studied regulatory non-coding small RNAs that silence animal genes throughout most biological processes, typically doing so by binding to partially complementary sequences within target RNAs. A plethora of studies has described detailed mechanisms for microRNA biogenesis and function, as well as their temporal and spatial regulation during development. By inducing translational repression and/or degradation of their target RNAs, microRNAs can contribute to achieve highly specific cell- or tissue-specific gene expression, while their aberrant expression can lead to disease. Yet an unresolved aspect of microRNA biology is how such small RNA molecules are themselves cleared from the cell, especially under circumstances where fast microRNA turnover or specific degradation of individual microRNAs is required. In recent years, it was unexpectedly found that binding of specific target RNAs to microRNAs with extensive complementarity can reverse the outcome, triggering degradation of the bound microRNAs. This emerging pathway, named TDMD for Target RNA-Directed MicroRNA Degradation, leads to microRNA 3'-end tailing by the addition of A/U non-templated nucleotides, trimming or shortening from the 3' end, and highly specific microRNA loss, providing a new layer of microRNA regulation. Originally described in flies and known to be triggered by viral RNAs, novel endogenous instances of TDMD have been uncovered and are now starting to be understood. Here, we review our current knowledge of this pathway and its potential role in the control and diversification of microRNA expression patterns."

        "abstract": "RNA interference (RNAi) has been widely adopted to repress specific gene expression and is easily achieved by designing small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) with perfect sequence complementarity to the intended target mRNAs. Although siRNAs direct Argonaute (Ago), a core component of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), to recognize and silence target mRNAs, they also inevitably function as microRNAs (miRNAs) and suppress hundreds of off-targets. Such miRNA-like off-target repression is potentially detrimental, resulting in unwanted toxicity and phenotypes. Despite early recognition of the severity of miRNA-like off-target repression, this effect has often been overlooked because of difficulties in recognizing and avoiding off-targets. However, recent advances in genome-wide methods and knowledge of Ago-miRNA target interactions have set the stage for properly evaluating and controlling miRNA-like off-target repression. Here, we describe the intrinsic problems of miRNA-like off-target effects caused by canonical and noncanonical interactions. We particularly focus on various genome-wide approaches and chemical modifications for the evaluation and prevention of off-target repression to facilitate the use of RNAi with secured specificity."

        "abstract": "The let-7 miRNA was one of the first miRNAs discovered in the nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, and its biological functions show a high level of evolutionary conservation from the nematode to the human. Unlike in C. elegans, higher animals have multiple isoforms of let-7 miRNAs; these isoforms share a consensus sequence called the 'seed sequence' and these isoforms are categorized into let-7 miRNA family. The expression of let-7 family is required for developmental timing and tumor suppressor function, but must be suppressed for the self-renewal of stem cells. Therefore, let-7 miRNA biogenesis must be carefully controlled. To generate a let-7 miRNA, a primary transcript is produced by RNA polymerase II and then subsequently processed by Drosha/DGCR8, TUTase, and Dicer. Because dysregulation of let-7 processing is deleterious, biogenesis of let-7 is tightly regulated by cellular factors, such as the RNA binding proteins, LIN28A/B and DIS3L2. In this review, we discuss the biological functions and biogenesis of let-7 miRNAs, focusing on the molecular mechanisms of regulation of let-7 biogenesis in vertebrates, such as the mouse and the human."

        "abstract": "More than six decades ago Watson and Crick published the chemical structure of DNA. This discovery revolutionized our approach to medical science and opened new perspectives for the diagnosis and treatment of many diseases including cancer. Since then, progress in molecular biology, together with the rapid advance of technologies, allowed to clone hundreds of protein-coding genes that were found mutated in all types of cancer. Normal and aberrant gene functions, interactions, and mechanisms of mutations were studied to identify the intricate network of pathways leading to cancer. With the acknowledgment of the genetic nature of cancer, new diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic strategies have been attempted and developed, but very few have found their way in the clinical field. In an effort to identify new translational targets, another great discovery has changed our way to look at genes and their functions. MicroRNAs have been the first noncoding genes involved in cancer. This review is a brief chronological history of microRNAs and cancer. Through the work of few of the greatest scientists of our times, this chapter describes the discovery of microRNAs from C. elegans to their debut in cancer and in the medical field, the concurrent development of technologies, and their future translational applications. The purpose was to share the exciting path that lead to one of the most important discoveries in cancer genetics in the past 20 years."

In addition to Drosha/DGCR8 and Dicer that are the essential components of the miRNA processing pathway, a range of other RNA binding proteins have recently been implicated in miRNA biogenesis. Among these, several well-known splicing factors have emerged as regulators of distinct miRNAs. In this review, we examine the mechanisms by which splicing factors regulate miRNA biogenesis. As both splicing factors and miRNAs play central roles in human disease biology we discuss implications of the links between splicing factors and miRNAs in human disease."

Since the identification of the first miRNA, lin-4, in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans in 1993, thousands of miRNAs have been discovered in animals and plants, and their regulatory roles in numerous biological processes have been uncovered. In plants, research efforts have established the major molecular framework of miRNA biogenesis and modes of action, and are beginning to elucidate the mechanisms of miRNA degradation. Studies have implicated restricted and surprising subcellular locations in which miRNA biogenesis or activity takes place. In this article, we summarize the current knowledge on how plant miRNAs are made and degraded, and how they repress target gene expression. We discuss not only the players involved in these processes, but also the subcellular sites in which these processes are known or implicated to take place. We hope to raise awareness that the cell biology of miRNAs holds the key to a full understanding of these enigmatic molecules."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) repress target genes through a poorly defined antisense mechanism. Cell-free and cell-based assays have supported the idea that miRNAs repress their target mRNAs by blocking initiation of translation, whereas studies in animal models argued against this possibility. We examined endogenous targets of the let-7 miRNA, an important regulator of stem cell fates. We report that let-7 represses translation initiation in Caenorhabditis elegans, demonstrating this mode of action for the first time in an organism. Unexpectedly, although the lin-4 miRNA was previously reported to repress its targets at a step downstream of translation initiation, we also observe repression of translation initiation for this miRNA. This repressive mechanism, which frequently but not always coincides with transcript degradation, requires the GW182 proteins AIN-1 and AIN-2, and acts on several mRNAs targeted by different miRNAs. Our analysis of an expanded set of endogenous miRNA targets therefore indicates widespread repression of translation initiation under physiological conditions and establishes C. elegans as a genetic system for dissection of the underlying mechanisms."

        "abstract": "The Drosha-DGCR8 complex, also known as Microprocessor, is essential for microRNA (miRNA) maturation. Drosha functions as the catalytic subunit, while DGCR8 (also known as Pasha) recognizes the RNA substrate. Although the action mechanism of this complex has been intensively studied, it remains unclear how Drosha and DGCR8 are regulated and if these proteins have any additional role(s) apart from miRNA processing. Here, we report that Drosha and DGCR8 regulate each other posttranscriptionally. The Drosha-DGCR8 complex cleaves the hairpin structures embedded in the DGCR8 mRNA and thereby destabilizes the mRNA. We further find that DGCR8 stabilizes the Drosha protein via protein-protein interaction. This crossregulation between Drosha and DGCR8 may contribute to the homeostatic control of miRNA biogenesis. Furthermore, microarray analyses suggest that a number of mRNAs may be downregulated in a Microprocessor-dependent, miRNA-independent manner. Our study reveals a previously unsuspected function of Microprocessor in mRNA stability control."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are fundamental regulatory elements of animal and plant gene expression. Although rapid progress in our understanding of miRNA biogenesis has been achieved by experimentation, computational approaches have also been influential in determining the general principles that are thought to govern miRNA target recognition and mode of action. We discuss how these principles are being progressively challenged by genetic and biochemical studies. In addition, we discuss the role of target-site-specific endonucleolytic cleavage, which is the hallmark of experimental RNA interference and a mechanism that is used by plant miRNAs and a few animal miRNAs. Generally thought to be merely a degradation mechanism, we propose that this might also be a biogenesis mechanism for biologically functional, non-coding RNA fragments."

The approximately 21 nt mature miRNA is processed from larger precursor molecules following a coordinated series of events. In theory, miRNA processing may be regulated at any of these steps. A growing body of evidence has demonstrated various steps in the miRNA biogenesis process for which regulation occurs. RNA editing of miRNA precursors, SNPs or mutations in the miRNA precursors, regulation by RNA binding proteins, alterations in the levels of key processing proteins, as well as a number of unknown mechanisms contribute to the regulation of miRNA processing. This article reviews the available literature on the regulation of miRNA processing that occurs within normal cells, during development or in diseases such as cancer."

        "abstract": "The slicer activity of the RNA-induced silencing complex is associated with argonaute, the RNase H-like PIWI domain of which catalyses guide-strand-mediated sequence-specific cleavage of target messenger RNA. Here we report on the crystal structure of Thermus thermophilus argonaute bound to a 5'-phosphorylated 21-base DNA guide strand, thereby identifying the nucleic-acid-binding channel positioned between the PAZ- and PIWI-containing lobes, as well as the pivot-like conformational changes associated with complex formation. The bound guide strand is anchored at both of its ends, with the solvent-exposed Watson-Crick edges of stacked bases 2 to 6 positioned for nucleation with the mRNA target, whereas two critically positioned arginines lock bases 10 and 11 at the cleavage site into an unanticipated orthogonal alignment. Biochemical studies indicate that key amino acid residues at the active site and those lining the 5'-phosphate-binding pocket made up of the Mid domain are critical for cleavage activity, whereas alterations of residues lining the 2-nucleotide 3'-end-binding pocket made up of the PAZ domain show little effect."

        "abstract": "MicroRNA 34a (miR-34a) is a tumor suppressor gene, but how it regulates cell proliferation is not completely understood. We now show that the microRNA miR-34a regulates silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1) expression. MiR-34a inhibits SIRT1 expression through a miR-34a-binding site within the 3' UTR of SIRT1. MiR-34 inhibition of SIRT1 leads to an increase in acetylated p53 and expression of p21 and PUMA, transcriptional targets of p53 that regulate the cell cycle and apoptosis, respectively. Furthermore, miR-34 suppression of SIRT1 ultimately leads to apoptosis in WT human colon cancer cells but not in human colon cancer cells lacking p53. Finally, miR-34a itself is a transcriptional target of p53, suggesting a positive feedback loop between p53 and miR-34a. Thus, miR-34a functions as a tumor suppressor, in part, through a SIRT1-p53 pathway."

        "abstract": "Plants produce two major types of small RNAs that are 21 to 24 nucleotides in size. Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are typically involved in transcriptional gene silencing that results from the targeting of genomic DNA and triggering of histone modifications or DNA methylation. Deep sequencing experiments have demonstrated that thousands of loci, usually repetitive sequences, generate these siRNAs. In contrast, microRNAs (miRNAs) are encoded by perhaps just several hundred loci per genome that generate Pol II-derived single stranded precursors which are processed into specific miRNAs. miRNAs act in a post-transcriptional manner to regulate gene function. Recent work has focused on the identification and classification of small RNA-producing loci, as well as understanding small RNA targeting and function, and the evolution of this relatively recently discovered class of regulatory molecules."

        "title": "Tapping RNA silencing pathways for plant biotechnology.",
        "abstract": "Plants have evolved a variety of gene silencing pathways mediated by small RNAs. Mostly 21 or 24 nt in size, these small RNAs repress the expression of sequence homologous genes at the transcriptional, post-transcriptional and translational levels. These pathways, also referred as RNA silencing pathways, play important roles in regulating growth and development as well as in response to both biotic and abiotic stress. Although the molecular basis of these complicated and interconnected pathways has become clear only in recent years, RNA silencing effects were observed and utilized in transgenic plants early in the plant biotechnology era, more than two decades ago. Today, with a better understanding of the pathways, various genetic engineering approaches have been developed to apply RNA silencing more effectively and broadly. In addition to summarizing the current models of RNA silencing, this review discusses examples of its potential uses and related issues concerning its application in plant biotechnology."

        "abstract": "Dysregulated expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) in various tissues has been associated with a variety of diseases, including cancers. Here we demonstrate that miRNAs are present in the serum and plasma of humans and other animals such as mice, rats, bovine fetuses, calves, and horses. The levels of miRNAs in serum are stable, reproducible, and consistent among individuals of the same species. Employing Solexa, we sequenced all serum miRNAs of healthy Chinese subjects and found over 100 and 91 serum miRNAs in male and female subjects, respectively. We also identified specific expression patterns of serum miRNAs for lung cancer, colorectal cancer, and diabetes, providing evidence that serum miRNAs contain fingerprints for various diseases. Two non-small cell lung cancer-specific serum miRNAs obtained by Solexa were further validated in an independent trial of 75 healthy donors and 152 cancer patients, using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assays. Through these analyses, we conclude that serum miRNAs can serve as potential biomarkers for the detection of various cancers and other diseases."

        "title": "A microRNA DNA methylation signature for human cancer metastasis.",
        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, noncoding RNAs that can contribute to cancer development and progression by acting as oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes. Recent studies have also linked different sets of miRNAs to metastasis through either the promotion or suppression of this malignant process. Interestingly, epigenetic silencing of miRNAs with tumor suppressor features by CpG island hypermethylation is also emerging as a common hallmark of human tumors. Thus, we wondered whether there was a miRNA hypermethylation profile characteristic of human metastasis. We used a pharmacological and genomic approach to reveal this aberrant epigenetic silencing program by treating lymph node metastatic cancer cells with a DNA demethylating agent followed by hybridization to an expression microarray. Among the miRNAs that were reactivated upon drug treatment, miR-148a, miR-34b/c, and miR-9 were found to undergo specific hypermethylation-associated silencing in cancer cells compared with normal tissues. The reintroduction of miR-148a and miR-34b/c in cancer cells with epigenetic inactivation inhibited their motility, reduced tumor growth, and inhibited metastasis formation in xenograft models, with an associated down-regulation of the miRNA oncogenic target genes, such as C-MYC, E2F3, CDK6, and TGIF2. Most important, the involvement of miR-148a, miR-34b/c, and miR-9 hypermethylation in metastasis formation was also suggested in human primary malignancies (n = 207) because it was significantly associated with the appearance of lymph node metastasis. Our findings indicate that DNA methylation-associated silencing of tumor suppressor miRNAs contributes to the development of human cancer metastasis."

Their mature products are approximately 21-24 nucleotides in length, and they collectively regulate a broad network of endogenous transcripts. A subset of animal miRNAs are produced from mirtrons, short hairpin introns whose splicing bypasses the normal nuclear processing of canonical miRNAs. Recent studies revealed novel, extended intramolecular dsRNA produced by defined transcription units in flies and mammals, termed hairpin RNAs (hpRNAs). Detailed biogenesis studies in Drosophila showed that hpRNAs are not merely \"long\" miRNAs, but are actually processed by a distinct biogenesis pathway that is related to the canonical RNA interference pathway. We compare and contrast the miRNA and hpRNA pathways in this review, and describe some of the key questions that the recognition of this novel pathway raises."

        "title": "MicroRNAs and their target gene networks in breast cancer.",
        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a major class of small endogenous RNA molecules that post-transcriptionally inhibit gene expression. Many miRNAs have been implicated in several human cancers, including breast cancer. Here we describe the association between altered miRNA signatures and breast cancer tumorigenesis and metastasis. The loss of several tumor suppressor miRNAs (miR-206, miR-17-5p, miR-125a, miR-125b, miR-200, let-7, miR-34 and miR-31) and the overexpression of certain oncogenic miRNAs (miR-21, miR-155, miR-10b, miR-373 and miR-520c) have been observed in many breast cancers. The gene networks orchestrated by these miRNAs are still largely unknown, although key targets have been identified that may contribute to the disease phenotype. Here we report how the observed perturbations in miRNA expression profiles may lead to disruption of key pathways involved in breast cancer."

        "title": "Gene silencing in Neurospora crassa requires a protein homologous to RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.",
        "abstract": "In plants and fungi, the introduction of transgenes can lead to post-transcriptional gene silencing. This phenomenon, in which expression of the transgene and of endogenous genes containing sequences homologous to the transgene can be blocked, is involved in virus resistance and genome maintenance. Transgene-induced gene silencing has been termed quelling in Neurospora crassa and co-suppression in plants. Quelling-defective (qde) mutants of N. crassa, in which transgene-induced gene silencing is impaired, have been isolated. Here we report the cloning of qde-1, the first cellular component of the gene-silencing mechanism to be isolated, which defines a new gene family conserved among different species including plants, animals and fungi. The qde-1 gene product is similar to an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase found in the tomato. The identification of qde-1 strongly supports models that implicate an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase in the post-transcriptional gene-silencing mechanism. The presence of qde-1 homologues in a variety of species of plants and fungi indicates that a conserved gene-silencing mechanism may exist, which could have evolved to preserve genome integrity and to protect the genome against naturally occurring transposons and viruses."

        "abstract": "Plant microRNAs (miRNAs) show a high degree of sequence complementarity to, and are believed to guide the cleavage of, their target messenger RNAs. Here, I show that miRNA172, which can base-pair with the messenger RNA of a floral homeotic gene, APETALA2, regulates APETALA2 expression primarily through translational inhibition. Elevated miRNA172 accumulation results in floral organ identity defects similar to those in loss-of-function apetala2 mutants. Elevated levels of mutant APETALA2 RNA with disrupted miRNA172 base pairing, but not wild-type APETALA2 RNA, result in elevated levels of APETALA2 protein and severe floral patterning defects. Therefore, miRNA172 likely acts in cell-fate specification as a translational repressor of APETALA2 in Arabidopsis flower development."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenously encoded small noncoding RNAs, derived by processing of short RNA hairpins, that can inhibit the translation of mRNAs bearing partially complementary target sequences. In contrast, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which are derived by processing of long double-stranded RNAs and are often of exogenous origin, degrade mRNAs bearing fully complementary sequences. Here, we demonstrate that an endogenously encoded human miRNA is able to cleave an mRNA bearing fully complementary target sites, whereas an exogenously supplied siRNA can inhibit the expression of an mRNA bearing partially complementary sequences without inducing detectable RNA cleavage. These data suggest that miRNAs and siRNAs can use similar mechanisms to repress mRNA expression and that the choice of mechanism may be largely or entirely determined by the degree of complementary of the RNA target."

        "abstract": "In RNA-mediated interference (RNAi), externally provided mixtures of sense and antisense RNA trigger concerted degradation of homologous cellular RNAs. We show that RNAi requires duplex formation between the two trigger strands, that the duplex must include a region of identity between trigger and target RNAs, and that duplexes as short as 26 bp can trigger RNAi. Consistent with in vitro observations, a fraction of input dsRNA is converted in vivo to short segments of approximately 25 nt. Interference assays with modified dsRNAs indicate precise chemical requirements for both bases and backbone of the RNA trigger. Strikingly, certain modifications are well tolerated on the sense, but not the antisense, strand, indicating that the two trigger strands have distinct roles in the interference process."

        "abstract": "Small regulatory RNAs including small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs), or Piwi interacting RNAs (piRNAs) guide regulation of gene expression in many different organisms. The Argonaute (Ago) protein family constitutes the cellular binding partners of such small RNAs and regulates gene expression on the levels of transcription, mRNA stability, or translation. Due to the lack of highly specific and potent monoclonal antibodies directed against the different Ago proteins, biochemical analyses such as Ago complex purification and characterization rely on overexpression of tagged Ago proteins. Here, we report the generation and functional characterization of a highly specific monoclonal anti-Ago2 antibody termed anti-Ago2(11A9). We show that anti-Ago2(11A9) is specific for human Ago2 and detects Ago2 in Western blots as well as in immunoprecipitation experiments. We further demonstrate that Ago2 can be efficiently eluted from our antibody by a competing peptide. Finally, we show that anti-Ago2(11A9) recognizes Ago2 in immunofluorescence experiments, and we find that Ago2 not only localizes to cytoplasmic processing bodies (P-bodies) and the diffuse cytoplasm but also to the nucleus. With the anti-Ago2(11A9) antibody we have generated a potent tool that is useful for many biochemical or cell biological applications."

Such effects have been proposed to result from a simple antisense mechanism that depends on hybridization between the injected RNA and endogenous messenger RNA transcripts. RNA interference has been used in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to manipulate gene expression. Here we investigate the requirements for structure and delivery of the interfering RNA. To our surprise, we found that double-stranded RNA was substantially more effective at producing interference than was either strand individually. After injection into adult animals, purified single strands had at most a modest effect, whereas double-stranded mixtures caused potent and specific interference. The effects of this interference were evident in both the injected animals and their progeny. Only a few molecules of injected double-stranded RNA were required per affected cell, arguing against stochiometric interference with endogenous mRNA and suggesting that there could be a catalytic or amplification component in the interference process."

Cancer cells have altered atterns of microRNA expression, which can be used to identify the cell of origin and to subtype cancers. RNAi has also been used to identify novel genes involved in cellular transformation using forward genetic screening methods previously only possible in invertebrates. Possible strategies and obstacles to harnessing RNAi for cancer therapy will also be discussed."

        "abstract": "MicroRNA (miRNA) gene expression profiling has provided important insights into plant and animal biology. However, there has not been ample published work about pitfalls associated with technical parameters in miRNA gene expression profiling. One source of pertinent information about technical variables in gene expression profiling is the separate and more well-established literature regarding mRNA expression profiling. However, many aspects of miRNA biochemistry are unique. For example, the cellular processing and compartmentation of miRNAs, the differential stability of specific miRNAs, and aspects of global miRNA expression regulation require specific consideration. Additional possible sources of systematic bias in miRNA expression studies include the differential impact of pre-analytical variables, substrate specificity of nucleic acid processing enzymes used in labeling and amplification, and issues regarding new miRNA discovery and annotation. We conclude that greater focus on technical parameters is required to bolster the validity, reliability, and cultural credibility of miRNA gene expression profiling studies."

        "title": "Role of miRNAs and siRNAs in biotic and abiotic stress responses of plants.",
        "abstract": "Small, non-coding RNAs are a distinct class of regulatory RNAs in plants and animals that control a variety of biological processes. In plants, several classes of small RNAs with specific sizes and dedicated functions have evolved through a series of pathways. The major classes of small RNAs include microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which differ in their biogenesis. miRNAs control the expression of cognate target genes by binding to reverse complementary sequences, resulting in cleavage or translational inhibition of the target RNAs. siRNAs have a similar structure, function, and biogenesis as miRNAs but are derived from long double-stranded RNAs and can often direct DNA methylation at target sequences. Besides their roles in growth and development and maintenance of genome integrity, small RNAs are also important components in plant stress responses. One way in which plants respond to environmental stress is by modifying their gene expression through the activity of small RNAs. Thus, understanding how small RNAs regulate gene expression will enable researchers to explore the role of small RNAs in biotic and abiotic stress responses. This review focuses on the regulatory roles of plant small RNAs in the adaptive response to stresses. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Plant gene regulation in response to abiotic stress."

        "abstract": "The human genome contains more than 1,000 microRNA (miRNA) genes, which are transcribed mainly by RNA polymerase II. The canonical pathway of miRNA biogenesis includes the nuclear processing of primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs) by the ribonuclease Drosha and further cytoplasmic processing of pre-miRNAs by the ribonuclease Dicer. This review discusses the issue of miRNA end heterogeneity generated primarily by Drosha and Dicer cleavage and focuses on the structural aspects of the Dicer step of miRNA biogenesis. We examine the structures of miRNA precursors, both predicted and experimentally determined, as well as the influence of various motifs that disturb the regularity of pre-miRNA structure on Dicer cleavage specificity. We evaluate the structural determinants of the length diversity of miRNA generated by Dicer from different precursors and highlight the importance of asymmetrical motifs. Finally, we discuss the impact of Dicer protein partners on cleavage efficiency and specificity and propose the contribution of pre-miRNA structural plasticity to the dynamics of the dicing complex."

        "abstract": "Posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS) processes double-stranded (ds) RNAs into 21-25 nucleotide (nt) RNA fragments that direct ribonucleases to target cognate mRNAs. In higher plants, PTGS also generates mobile signals conferring sequence-specific silencing in distant organs. Since PTGS acts as an antiviral system in plants, successful virus infection requires evasion or suppression of gene silencing. Here we report that the 19 kDa protein (p19) of tombusviruses is a potent silencing suppressor that prevents the spread of mobile silencing signal. In vitro, p19 binds PTGS-generated, 21-25 nt dsRNAs and 21-nt synthetic dsRNAs with 2-nt 3' overhanging end(s), while it barely interacts with single-stranded (ss) RNAs, long dsRNAs or blunt-ended 21-nt dsRNAs. We propose that p19 mediates silencing suppression by sequestering the PTGS-generated 21-25 nt dsRNAs, thus depleting the specificity determinants of PTGS effector complexes. Moreover, the observation that p19-expressing transgenic plants show altered leaf morphology might indicate that the p19-targeted PTGS pathway is also important in the regulation of plant development."

        "abstract": "microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are small RNAs that repress gene expression at the post-transcriptional level in plants and animals. Small RNAs guide Argonaute-containing RNA-induced silencing complexes to target RNAs in a sequence-specific manner, resulting in mRNA deadenylation followed by exonucleolytic decay, mRNA endonucleolytic cleavage, or translational inhibition. Although our knowledge of small RNA biogenesis, turnover, and mechanisms of action has dramatically expanded in the past decade, the subcellular location of small RNA-mediated RNA silencing still needs to be defined. In contrast to the prevalent presumption that RNA silencing occurs in the cytosol, emerging evidence reveals connections between the endomembrane system and small RNA activities in plants and animals. Here, we summarize the work that uncovered this link between small RNAs and endomembrane compartments and present an overview of the involvement of the endomembrane system in various aspects of RNA silencing. We propose that the endomembrane system is an integral component of RNA silencing that has been long overlooked and predict that a marriage between cell biology and RNA biology holds the key to a full understanding of post-transcriptional gene regulation by small RNAs."

The converse is also true: miRNAs have emerged as key regulatory components in the life cycle of the worm, as well as numerous other organisms. Since the landmark discovery in 1993 of the first miRNA gene, lin-4, several other miRNAs have been characterized in detail in C. elegans and shown to participate in diverse biological processes. Moreover, the worm has provided, by virtue of its ease of genetic manipulation and amenability to high-throughput methods, an ideal platform for elucidating many general and conserved aspects of miRNA biology, namely mechanisms of biogenesis, target recognition, gene silencing, and regulation thereof. In this review, we summarize both the contribution of miRNAs to C. elegans physiology and development, as well as the contribution of C. elegans research to our understanding of general features of miRNA biology."

        "abstract": "microRNAs are widely expressed, \u223c22-nt-long regulatory RNAs. They are first transcribed as much longer primary transcripts, which then undergo a series of processing steps to yield the single-stranded, mature microRNAs, although the mechanisms are incompletely understood. Here, we show that the terminal loop region of human primary microRNA transcripts is an important determinant of microRNA biogenesis. Mutations that restrain the terminal loop region inhibit Drosha processing of primary microRNA transcripts as well as Dicer processing of precursor microRNA transcripts in vitro. The inhibition may result from lower enzyme turnover on the mutant transcripts. Consequently, the mutations reduce miRNA maturation in transfected human cells. We conclude that a flexible terminal loop region is critical for microRNA processing."

More recently, it has become apparent that miRNA regulators themselves are subject to sophisticated control. Many reports over the past few years have reported the regulation of miRNA metabolism and function by a range of mechanisms involving numerous protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions. Such regulation has an important role in the context-specific functions of miRNAs."

MiRNAs play important roles in regulating a variety of biological process such as proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. It has been demonstrated that miRNAs have a crucial function in oncogenesis by regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis as oncogenes or tumour suppressors. As several reports have underlined the possible contribution of miRNAs to promote or evade apoptosis, it seems that the dysregulation of miRNAs involved in apoptosis may provide a mechanism for cancer development. Given emerging evidence that points to oncogenic and tumour suppressive roles of miRNAs in cancer and apoptosis, it is thought that manipulating miRNA expression level may be a potential therapeutic strategy for curing cancer."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are newly discovered, small, noncoding ribonucleic acids (RNAs) that play critical roles in the regulation of host genome expression at the posttranscriptional level. During last 20 years, miRNAs have emerged as key regulators of various biological processes including immune cell lineage commitment, differentiation, maturation, and maintenance of immune homeostasis and normal function. Thus, it is not surprising that dysregulated miRNA expression patterns now have been documented in a broad range of diseases including cancer as well as inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. This rapidly emerging field has revolutionized our understanding of normal immunoregulation and breakdown of self-tolerance. This review focuses on the current understanding of miRNA biogenesis, the role of miRNAs in the regulation of innate and adaptive immunity, and the association of miRNAs with autoimmune diseases. We have discussed miRNA dysregulation and the potential role of miRNAs in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis, and multiple sclerosis. Given that most autoimmune diseases are female-predominant, we also have discussed sex hormone regulation of miRNAs in inflammatory responses, with an emphasis on estrogen, which now has been shown to regulate miRNAs in the immune system. The field of miRNA regulation of mammalian genes has tremendous potential. The identification of specific miRNA expression patterns in autoimmune diseases as well as a comprehensive understanding of the role of miRNA in disease pathogenesis offers promise of not only novel molecular diagnostic markers but also new gene therapy strategies for treating SLE and other inflammatory autoimmune diseases."

        "title": "microRNAs and the regulation of neuronal plasticity under stress conditions.",
        "abstract": "In the brain, the connection between sensory information triggered by the presence of a stressor and the organism's reaction involves limbic areas such as the hippocampus, amygdala and prefrontal cortex. Consequently, these brain regions are the most sensitive to stress-induced changes in neuronal plasticity. However, the specific effects of stress on neuronal plasticity in these regions largely differ. Despite these regional differences, in many cases the steps leading to brain adaptation to stress involve highly coordinated changes in gene expression affecting cell metabolism, neuronal plasticity and synaptic transmission. In adult life the effects of stress on neuronal plasticity are largely reversible but stress in early life induces persistent changes in neuronal plasticity that increases vulnerability to develop psychopathologies and aging-related cognitive decline, suggesting the involvement of epigenetic mechanisms. A growing body of evidence demonstrates that microRNAs (miRs) are key players in epigenetic regulation. In this forefront review we present a critical look on the literature demonstrating the regulation of neuronal plasticity by miRs and the molecular mechanisms of target specificity in neurons. We propose that further progress in the identification of miR's function beyond single target identification would require a combination of developmental expression studies, bioinformatics and a deeper understanding of large networks of targets involved in epigenetic regulation. This will help to extend our understanding of the role miRs play in the regulation of stress-induced neuronal plasticity."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are key regulators of gene expression. They are conserved across species, expressed across cell types, and active against a large proportion of the transcriptome. The sequence-complementary mechanism of miRNA activity exploits combinatorial diversity, a property conducive to network-wide regulation of gene expression, and functional evidence supporting this hypothesized systems-level role has steadily begun to accumulate. The emerging models are exciting and will yield deep insight into the regulatory architecture of biology. However, because of the technical challenges facing the network-based study of miRNAs, many gaps remain. Here, we review mammalian miRNAs by describing recent advances in understanding their molecular activity and network-wide function."

        "abstract": "The challenge of understanding the widespread biological roles of animal microRNAs (miRNAs) has prompted the development of genetic and functional genomics technologies for miRNA loss-of-function studies. However, tools for exploring the functions of entire miRNA families are still limited. We developed a method that enables antagonism of miRNA function using seed-targeting 8-mer locked nucleic acid (LNA) oligonucleotides, termed tiny LNAs. Transfection of tiny LNAs into cells resulted in simultaneous inhibition of miRNAs within families sharing the same seed with concomitant upregulation of direct targets. In addition, systemically delivered, unconjugated tiny LNAs showed uptake in many normal tissues and in breast tumors in mice, coinciding with long-term miRNA silencing. Transcriptional and proteomic profiling suggested that tiny LNAs have negligible off-target effects, not significantly altering the output from mRNAs with perfect tiny LNA complementary sites. Considered together, these data support the utility of tiny LNAs in elucidating the functions of miRNA families in vivo."

        "abstract": "The let-7 microRNA (miRNA) regulates cellular differentiation across many animal species. Loss of let-7 activity causes abnormal development in Caenorhabditis elegans and unchecked cellular proliferation in human cells, which contributes to tumorigenesis. These defects are due to improper expression of protein-coding genes normally under let-7 regulation. While some direct targets of let-7 have been identified, the genome-wide effect of let-7 insufficiency in a developing animal has not been fully investigated. Here we report the results of molecular and genetic assays aimed at determining the global network of genes regulated by let-7 in C. elegans. By screening for mis-regulated genes that also contribute to let-7 mutant phenotypes, we derived a list of physiologically relevant potential targets of let-7 regulation. Twenty new suppressors of the rupturing vulva or extra seam cell division phenotypes characteristic of let-7 mutants emerged. Three of these genes, opt-2, prmt-1, and T27D12.1, were found to associate with Argonaute in a let-7-dependent manner and are likely novel direct targets of this miRNA. Overall, a complex network of genes with various activities is subject to let-7 regulation to coordinate developmental timing across tissues during worm development."

Micro RNAs area set of small, endogenous, highly conserved, non-coding RNAs that control the expression of about 30% genes at post-transcriptional levels. Typically, microRNAs impede the translation and stability of messenger RNAs (mRNA), control genes associated with cellular processes namely inflammation, cell cycle regulation, stress response, differentiation, apoptosis, and migration. Compelling findings revealed that miRNA mutations or disruption correspond to diverse human cancers and suggest that miRNAs can function as tumor suppressors or oncogenes. Here we summarize the literature on these master regulators in clinical settings from last three decades as both abrupt cancer therapeutics and as an approach to sensitize tumors to chemotherapy. This review highlights (I) the prevailing perception of miRNA genomics, biogenesis, as well as function; (II) the significant advancements in regulatory mechanisms in the expression of carcinogenic genes; and (III) explains, how miRNA is utilized as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for the disease stage indicating survival as well as therapeutic targets in cancer."

Within RISC, a member of the Argonaute protein family directly binds the guide strand and the siRNA guides RISC to fully complementary sites on-target RNAs, which are then sequence-specifically cleaved by the Argonaute protein-a process commonly referred to as RNA interference (RNAi). In animals, endogenous microRNAs (miRNAs) function similarly but do not lead to direct cleavage of the target RNA but to translational inhibition followed by exonucleolytic decay. This is due to only partial complementarity between the miRNA and the target RNA. SiRNAs, however, can function as miRNAs, and partial complementarity can lead to miRNA-like off-target effects in RNAi applications. Since siRNAs are widely used not only for screening but also for therapeutics as well as crop protection purposes, such miRNA-like off-target effects need to be minimized. Strategies such as RNA modifications or pooling of siRNAs have been developed and are used to reduce off-target effects."

However, the mechanism of small RNA asymmetry sensing in mammalian RISC assembly remains obscure. Here, we quantitatively examined RISC assembly and target silencing activity in the presence or absence of Dicer in mammals. Our data show that, unlike the well-characterized fly Ago2-RISC assembly pathway, mammalian Dicer is dispensable for asymmetric RISC loading in vivo and in vitro."

In cancer, the loss of tumour-suppressive miRNAs enhances the expression of target oncogenes, whereas increased expression of oncogenic miRNAs (known as oncomirs) can repress target tumour suppressor genes. This realization has resulted in a quest to understand the pathways that are regulated by these miRNAs using in vivo model systems, and to comprehend the feasibility of targeting oncogenic miRNAs and restoring tumour-suppressive miRNAs for cancer therapy. Here we discuss progress in using mouse models to understand the roles of miRNAs in cancer and the potential for manipulating miRNAs for cancer therapy as these molecules make their way towards clinical trials."

Plants possess multiple functional DCL, RDR, and AGO proteins. Genetic analyses in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana have revealed multiple small RNA pathways, each utilizing a distinct set of RNA silencing factors. In this short review, mainly based on the work done on A. thaliana, we give a brief overview on the multiple small RNA-directed silencing pathways in plants, which includes the biogenesis and function of microRNAs (miRNAs), trans-acting siRNAs (ta-siRNAs), natural cis-antisense transcripts-associated siRNAs (nat-siRNAs), and heterochromatic siRNAs."

After our previous work indicating a tumor suppressor function of miR-15a/16-1 by targeting the BCL2 oncogene, here, we produced a high-throughput profiling of genes modulated by miR-15a/16-1 in a leukemic cell line model (MEG-01) and in primary CLL samples. By combining experimental and bioinformatics data, we identified a miR-15a/16-1-gene signature in leukemic cells. Among the components of the miR-15a/16-1 signature, we observed a statistically significant enrichment in AU-rich elements (AREs). By examining the Gene Ontology (GO) database, a significant enrichment in cancer genes (such as MCL1, BCL2, ETS1, or JUN) that directly or indirectly affect apoptosis and cell cycle was found."

We used miRNA microarray data of 253 samples to construct a transparent classifier based on 48 miRNAs. Two-thirds of samples were classified with high confidence, with accuracy >90%. In an independent blinded test-set of 83 samples, overall high-confidence accuracy reached 89%. Classification accuracy reached 100% for most tissue classes, including 131 metastatic samples. We further validated the utility of the miRNA biomarkers by quantitative RT-PCR using 65 additional blinded test samples.

Export of small RNAs from the nucleus, including miRNA, is facilitated by three closely related karyopherin-related nuclear transporters, Exportin-5, Exportin-1 and Exportin-T. While all three exportins have direct orthologues in deutrostomes, missing exportins in arthropods (Exportin-T) and nematodes (Exportin-5) are likely compensated by dual specificities of one of the other exportin paralogues."

                "#text": "Co-opting particular isoforms from large, diverse protein families seems to be a common theme in the evolution of miRNA biogenesis. Human miRNA biogenesis proteins have direct, orthologues in cold-blooded fishes and, in some cases, urochordates and deutrostomes. However, lineage specific expansions of Dicer in plants and invertebrates as well as Argonaute and RNA-binding proteins in vertebrates suggests that novel ncRNA regulatory mechanisms can evolve in relatively short evolutionary timeframes. The occurrence of multiple homologues to RNA-binding and Argonaute/PIWI proteins also suggests the possible existence of further pathways for additional types of ncRNAs."

        "title": "miR-148 targets human DNMT3b protein coding region.",
        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNA molecules of 20-24 nucleotides that regulate gene expression. In animals, miRNAs form imperfect interactions with sequences in the 3' Untranslated region (3'UTR) of mRNAs, causing translational inhibition and mRNA decay. In contrast, plant miRNAs mostly associate with protein coding regions. Here we show that human miR-148 represses DNA methyltransferase 3b (Dnmt3b) gene expression through a region in its coding sequence. This region is evolutionary conserved and present in the Dnmt3b splice variants Dnmt3b1, Dnmt3b2, and Dnmt3b4, but not in the abundantly expressed Dnmt3b3. Whereas overexpression of miR-148 results in decreased DNMT3b1 expression, short-hairpin RNA-mediated miR-148 repression leads to an increase in DNMT3b1 expression. Interestingly, mutating the putative miR-148 target site in Dnmt3b1 abolishes regulation by miR-148. Moreover, endogenous Dnmt3b3 mRNA, which lacks the putative miR-148 target site, is resistant to miR-148-mediated regulation. Thus, our results demonstrate that the coding sequence of Dnmt3b mediates regulation by the miR-148 family. More generally, we provide evidence that coding regions of human genes can be targeted by miRNAs, and that such a mechanism might play a role in determining the relative abundance of different splice variants."

        "abstract": "microRNAs (miRNAs) are small regulatory RNAs that are important in development and disease and therefore represent a potential new class of targets for therapeutic intervention. Despite recent progress in silencing of miRNAs in rodents, the development of effective and safe approaches for sequence-specific antagonism of miRNAs in vivo remains a significant scientific and therapeutic challenge. Moreover, there are no reports of miRNA antagonism in primates. Here we show that the simple systemic delivery of a unconjugated, PBS-formulated locked-nucleic-acid-modified oligonucleotide (LNA-antimiR) effectively antagonizes the liver-expressed miR-122 in non-human primates. Acute administration by intravenous injections of 3 or 10 mg kg(-1) LNA-antimiR to African green monkeys resulted in uptake of the LNA-antimiR in the cytoplasm of primate hepatocytes and formation of stable heteroduplexes between the LNA-antimiR and miR-122. This was accompanied by depletion of mature miR-122 and dose-dependent lowering of plasma cholesterol. Efficient silencing of miR-122 was achieved in primates by three doses of 10 mg kg(-1) LNA-antimiR, leading to a long-lasting and reversible decrease in total plasma cholesterol without any evidence for LNA-associated toxicities or histopathological changes in the study animals. Our findings demonstrate the utility of systemically administered LNA-antimiRs in exploring miRNA function in rodents and primates, and support the potential of these compounds as a new class of therapeutics for disease-associated miRNAs."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) were discovered more than a decade ago as noncoding, single-stranded small RNAs (approximately 22 nucleotides) that control the timed gene expression pattern in Caenorhabditis elegans life cycle. A number of these evolutionarily conserved, endogenous miRNAs have been shown to regulate mammalian cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis. miRNAs are multispecific by nature. The individual miRNA is capable of modulating the expression of a network of mRNAs that it binds by imperfect sequence complementarity. Human cancers commonly exhibit an altered expression profile of miRNAs with oncogenic (miR-21, miR-106a and miR-155) or tumor-suppressive (let-7, miR-15a/16, miR-34a and miR-143/145) activity. As consistent with the natural function of miRNAs in specifying cellular phenotype, miRNA-based cancer gene therapy offers the theoretical appeal of targeting multiple gene networks that are controlled by a single, aberrantly expressed miRNA. Reconstitution of tumor-suppressive miRNA, or sequence-specific knockdown of oncogenic miRNAs by 'antagomirs,' has produced favorable antitumor outcomes in experimental models. We discuss pending issues that need to be resolved prior to the consideration of miRNA-based experimental cancer gene therapy. These include the need for definitive mRNA target validation, our incomplete understanding of rate-limiting cellular components that impact the efficiency of this posttranscriptional gene-silencing phenomenon, the possibility for nonspecific immune activation and the lack of a defined, optimal mode of delivery."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNA molecules that negatively control expression of target genes in animals and plants. The microRNA-21 gene (mir-21) has been identified as the only miRNA commonly overexpressed in solid tumors of the lung, breast, stomach, prostate, colon, brain, head and neck, esophagus and pancreas. We initiated a screen to identify miR-21 target genes using a reporter assay and identified a potential miR-21 target in the 3'-UTR of the programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4) gene. We cloned the full-length 3'-UTR of human PDCD4 downstream of a reporter and found that mir-21 downregulated, whereas a modified antisense RNA to miR-21 upregulated reporter activity. Moreover, deletion of the putative miR-21-binding site (miRNA regulatory element, MRE) from the 3'-UTR of PDCD4, or mutations in the MRE abolished the ability of miR-21 to inhibit reporter activity, indicating that this MRE is a critical regulatory region. Western blotting showed that Pdcd4 protein levels were reduced by miR-21 in human and mouse cells, whereas quantitative real-time PCR revealed little difference at the mRNA level, suggesting translational regulation. Finally, overexpression of mir-21 in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells and mouse epidermal JB6 cells promoted soft agar colony formation by downregulating Pdcd4 protein levels. The demonstration that miR-21 promotes cell transformation supports the concept that mir-21 functions as an oncogene by a mechanism that involves translational repression of the tumor suppressor Pdcd4."

        "abstract": "Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) facilitates tissue remodelling during embryonic development and is viewed as an essential early step in tumour metastasis. We found that all five members of the microRNA-200 family (miR-200a, miR-200b, miR-200c, miR-141 and miR-429) and miR-205 were markedly downregulated in cells that had undergone EMT in response to transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta or to ectopic expression of the protein tyrosine phosphatase Pez. Enforced expression of the miR-200 family alone was sufficient to prevent TGF-beta-induced EMT. Together, these microRNAs cooperatively regulate expression of the E-cadherin transcriptional repressors ZEB1 (also known as deltaEF1) and SIP1 (also known as ZEB2), factors previously implicated in EMT and tumour metastasis. Inhibition of the microRNAs was sufficient to induce EMT in a process requiring upregulation of ZEB1 and/or SIP1. Conversely, ectopic expression of these microRNAs in mesenchymal cells initiated mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET). Consistent with their role in regulating EMT, expression of these microRNAs was found to be lost in invasive breast cancer cell lines with mesenchymal phenotype. Expression of the miR-200 family was also lost in regions of metaplastic breast cancer specimens lacking E-cadherin. These data suggest that downregulation of the microRNAs may be an important step in tumour progression."

The other strand, known as the miRNA* species, has typically been assumed to be a carrier strand. Here we show that, although Drosophila melanogaster miRNA* species are less abundant than their partners, they are often present at physiologically relevant levels and can associate with Argonaute proteins. Comparative genomic analyses revealed that >40% of miRNA* sequences resist nucleotide divergence across Drosophilid evolution, and at least half of these well-conserved miRNA* species select for conserved 3' untranslated region seed matches well above background noise. Finally, we validated the inhibitory activity of miRNA* species in both cultured cells and transgenic animals. These data broaden the reach of the miRNA regulatory network and suggest an important mechanism that diversifies miRNA function during evolution."

Multiple classes of small RNA, including small-interfering RNA (siRNA), micro-RNA (miRNA), and piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA), play important roles in many fundamental biological and disease processes. Collective studies in multiple organisms, including plants, Drosophila, Caenorhabditis elegans, and mammals indicate that these pathways are highly conserved throughout evolution. Thus, scientists across disciplines have found novel pathways to unravel, new insights in probing pathology, and nascent technologies to develop. The field of RNAi also provides a clear framework for understanding fundamental principles of biochemistry. The current review highlights elegant, reason-based experimentation in discovering RNA-directed biological phenomena and the importance of robust assay development in translating these observations into mechanistic understanding. This biochemical template also provides a conceptual framework for overcoming emerging challenges in the field and for understanding an expanding small RNA world."

After the identification of hundreds of miRNAs, the challenge is now to understand their specific biological function. Signalling pathways are ideal candidates for miRNA-mediated regulation owing to the sharp dose-sensitive nature of their effects. Indeed, emerging evidence suggests that miRNAs affect the responsiveness of cells to signalling molecules such as transforming growth factor-beta, WNT, Notch and epidermal growth factor. As such, miRNAs serve as nodes of signalling networks that ensure homeostasis and regulate cancer, metastasis, fibrosis and stem cell biology."

In this review we first provide an overview of the different ncRNA families, focusing in particular on miRNAs and their relevance in tumour development and progression. Second we shortly describe the available ncRNA expression profiling methods, which comprise microarray, bead-based hybridization methods, in situ hybridization, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, cloning and deep sequencing methods. Finally, we used the PubMed database to perform an extensive literature search for miRNA expression profiling research articles in cancer and identified 58 studies that were published between 2004 and 2009; we identified 70 miRNAs that were reported in at least five studies as being either up- or downregulated, depending on the type of cancer, and 192 miRNAs that were reported to be up- or downregulated in at least two reports. MiRNA expression profiling of human tumours has identified signatures associated with diagnosis, staging, progression, prognosis, and response to treatment. Based on the most important findings we discuss the possible use of miRNAs as clinical biomarkers in the management of cancer patients for diagnosis, prognosis, and response to therapy."

        "abstract": "Human milk (HM) is the optimal source of nutrition, protection and developmental programming for infants. It is species-specific and consists of various bioactive components, including microRNAs, small non-coding RNAs regulating gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. microRNAs are both intra- and extra-cellular and are present in body fluids of humans and animals. Of these body fluids, HM appears to be one of the richest sources of microRNA, which are highly conserved in its different fractions, with milk cells containing more microRNAs than milk lipids, followed by skim milk. Potential effects of exogenous food-derived microRNAs on gene expression have been demonstrated, together with the stability of milk-derived microRNAs in the gastrointestinal tract. Taken together, these strongly support the notion that milk microRNAs enter the systemic circulation of the HM fed infant and exert tissue-specific immunoprotective and developmental functions. This has initiated intensive research on the origin, fate and functional significance of milk microRNAs. Importantly, recent studies have provided evidence of endogenous synthesis of HM microRNA within the human lactating mammary epithelium. These findings will now form the basis for investigations of the role of microRNA in the epigenetic control of normal and aberrant mammary development, and particularly lactation performance."

This intriguing phenomenon indicates that miRNAs of diet/plant origin may act as a new class of bioactive ingredients communicating with mammalian systems. In this review, in order to pinpoint the reason underlying discrepancies of miRNAs transmission from diet/plant to animals, the pathways that generate miRNAs and machineries involved in the functions of miRNAs in both kingdoms were outlined and compared. Then, the current controversies concerning cross-kingdom regulations and the potential mechanisms responsible for absorption and transfer of diet/plant-derived miRNAs were interpreted. Furthermore, the hormone-like action of miRNAs and the intricate interplay between miRNAs and hormones were implicated. Finally, how these findings may impact nutrition and medicine were briefly discussed."

Knockdown of Dicer in HeLa cells revealed that the HMGA2 gene is transcriptionally active, but its mRNA is destabilized in the cytoplasm through the microRNA (miRNA) pathway. HMGA2 was derepressed upon inhibition of let-7 in cells with high levels of the miRNA. Ectopic expression of let-7 reduced HMGA2 and cell proliferation in a lung cancer cell. The effect of let-7 on HMGA2 was dependent on multiple target sites in the 3' untranslated region (UTR), and the growth-suppressive effect of let-7 on lung cancer cells was rescued by overexpression of the HMGA2 ORF without a 3'UTR. Our results provide a novel example of suppression of an oncogene by a tumor-suppressive miRNA and suggest that some tumors activate the oncogene through chromosomal translocations that eliminate the oncogene's 3'UTR with the let-7 target sites."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of approximately 22-nt noncoding RNAs that can posttranscriptionally regulate gene expression. Several miRNAs are specifically expressed in hematopoietic cells. Here we show that one such miRNA, miR-150, is mainly expressed in the lymph nodes and spleen and is highly up-regulated during the development of mature T and B cells; expression of miR-150 is sharply up-regulated at the immature B cell stage. Overexpression of miR-150 in hematopoietic stem cells, followed by bone marrow transplantation, had little effect on the formation of either mature CD8- and CD4-positive T cells or granulocytes or macrophages, but the formation of mature B cells was greatly impaired. Furthermore, premature expression of miR-150 blocked the transition from the pro-B to the pre-B stage. Our results indicate that miR-150 most likely down-regulates mRNAs that are important for pre- and pro-B cell formation or function, and its ectopic expression in these cells blocks further development of B cells."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an abundant class of 20-23-nt long regulators of gene expression. The study of miRNA function in mice and potential therapeutic approaches largely depend on modified oligonucleotides. We recently demonstrated silencing miRNA function in mice using chemically modified and cholesterol-conjugated RNAs termed 'antagomirs'. Here, we further characterize the properties and function of antagomirs in mice. We demonstrate that antagomirs harbor optimized phosphorothioate modifications, require >19-nt length for highest efficiency and can discriminate between single nucleotide mismatches of the targeted miRNA. Degradation of different chemically protected miRNA/antagomir duplexes in mouse livers and localization of antagomirs in a cytosolic compartment that is distinct from processing (P)-bodies indicates a degradation mechanism independent of the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway. Finally, we show that antagomirs, although incapable of silencing miRNAs in the central nervous system (CNS) when injected systemically, efficiently target miRNAs when injected locally into the mouse cortex. Our data further validate the effectiveness of antagomirs in vivo and should facilitate future studies to silence miRNAs for functional analysis and in clinically relevant settings."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important for regulating gene expression in muticellular organisms. MiRNA processing is a two-step process. In animal cells, the first step is nuclear and the second step cytoplasmic, whereas in plant cells, both steps occur in the nucleus via the enzyme Dicer-like1 (DCL1) and other proteins including the zinc-finger-domain protein Serrate (SE) and a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) binding-domain protein, Hyponastic Leaves1 (HYL1). Furthermore, plant miRNAs are methylated by Hua Enhancer (HEN1) at their 3' ends and loaded onto Argonaute1 (AGO1). However, little is known about the cellular basis of miRNA biogenesis. Using live-cell imaging, we show here that DCL1 and HYL1 colocalize in discrete nuclear bodies in addition to being present in a low-level diffuse nucleoplasmic distribution. These bodies, which we refer to as nuclear dicing bodies (D-bodies), differ from Cajal bodies. A mutated DCL1 with impaired function in miRNA processing fails to target to D-bodies, and an introduced primary (pri)-miRNA transcript is recruited to D-bodies. Furthermore, bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) shows that DCL1, HYL1, and SE interact in D-bodies. On the basis of these data, we propose that D-bodies are crucial for orchestrating pri-miRNA processing and/or storage/assembly of miRNA-processing complexes in the nuclei of plant cells."

        "abstract": "miRNAs (microRNAs) are a class of endogenous small RNAs that are thought to negatively regulate protein production. Aberrant expression of many miRNAs is linked to cancer and other diseases. Little is known about the factors that regulate the expression of miRNAs. We have identified numerous regulatory elements upstream of miRNA genes that are likely to be essential to the transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation of miRNAs. Newly identified regulatory motifs occur frequently and in multiple copies upstream of miRNAs. The motifs are highly enriched in G and C nucleotides, in comparison with the nucleotide composition of miRNA upstream sequences. Although the motifs were predicted using sequences that are upstream of miRNAs, we find that 99% of the top-predicted motifs preferentially occur within the first 500 nucleotides upstream of the transcription start sites of protein-coding genes; the observed preference in location underscores the validity and importance of the motifs identified in this study. Our study also raises the possibility that a considerable number of well-characterized, disease-associated transcription factors (TFs) of protein-coding genes contribute to the abnormal miRNA expression in diseases such as cancer. Further analysis of predicted miRNA-protein interactions lead us to hypothesize that TFs that include c-Myb, NF-Y, Sp-1, MTF-1, and AP-2alpha are master-regulators of miRNA expression. Our predictions are a solid starting point for the systematic elucidation of the causative basis for aberrant expression patterns of disease-related (e.g., cancer) miRNAs. Thus, we point out that focused studies of the TFs that regulate miRNAs will be paramount in developing cures for miRNA-related diseases. The identification of the miRNA regulatory motifs was facilitated by a new computational method, K-Factor. K-Factor predicts regulatory motifs in a set of functionally related sequences, without relying on evolutionary conservation."

The ancestral function of small RNA-dependent silencing is related to genome protection against parasitic nucleic acids, such as transposons and viruses. However, new classes of small RNAs are continuously being uncovered in all higher eukaryotes in which they play important functions in processes ranging from embryonic development to differentiation to cell proliferation and metabolism. Small RNAs have variegated biogenesis pathways and accomplish distinct functions. Nevertheless, it appears that all small RNAs work merely as guides in recognizing the target RNAs invariably relying on the interaction with Argonaute proteins and associated factors for their biological function. Here, we discuss recent findings on the structure and regulation of mammalian Argonaute proteins and overview the various roles that these versatile proteins play in regulating gene expression."

        "title": "microRNA-mediated messenger RNA deadenylation contributes to translational repression in mammalian cells.",
        "abstract": "Animal microRNAs (miRNAs) typically regulate gene expression by binding to partially complementary target sites in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of messenger RNA (mRNA) reducing its translation and stability. They also commonly induce shortening of the mRNA 3' poly(A) tail, which contributes to their mRNA decay promoting function. The relationship between miRNA-mediated deadenylation and translational repression has been less clear. Using transfection of reporter constructs carrying three imperfectly matching let-7 target sites in the 3' UTR into mammalian cells we observe rapid target mRNA deadenylation that precedes measureable translational repression by endogenous let-7 miRNA. Depleting cells of the argonaute co-factors RCK or TNRC6A can impair let-7-mediated repression despite ongoing mRNA deadenylation, indicating that deadenylation alone is not sufficient to effect full repression. Nevertheless, the magnitude of translational repression by let-7 is diminished when the target reporter lacks a poly(A) tail. Employing an antisense strategy to block deadenylation of target mRNA with poly(A) tail also partially impairs translational repression. On the one hand, these experiments confirm that tail removal by deadenylation is not strictly required for translational repression. On the other hand they show directly that deadenylation can augment miRNA-mediated translational repression in mammalian cells beyond stimulating mRNA decay. Taken together with published work, these results suggest a dual role of deadenylation in miRNA function: it contributes to translational repression as well as mRNA decay and is thus critically involved in establishing the quantitatively appropriate physiological response to miRNAs."

        "abstract": "The let-7 microRNA (miRNA) is an ultraconserved regulator of stem cell differentiation and developmental timing and a candidate tumor suppressor. Here we show that LIN-28 and the poly(U) polymerase PUP-2 regulate let-7 processing in Caenorhabditis elegans. We demonstrate that lin-28 is necessary and sufficient to block let-7 activity in vivo; LIN-28 directly binds let-7 pre-miRNA to prevent Dicer processing. Moreover, we have identified a poly(U) polymerase, PUP-2, which regulates the stability of LIN-28-blockaded let-7 pre-miRNA and contributes to LIN-28-dependent regulation of let-7 during development. We show that PUP-2 and LIN-28 interact directly, and that LIN-28 stimulates uridylation of let-7 pre-miRNA by PUP-2 in vitro. Our results demonstrate that LIN-28 and let-7 form an ancient regulatory switch, conserved from nematodes to humans, and provide insight into the mechanism of LIN-28 action in vivo. Uridylation by a PUP-2 ortholog might regulate let-7 and additional miRNAs in other species. Given the roles of Lin28 and let-7 in stem cell and cancer biology, we propose that such poly(U) polymerases are potential therapeutic targets."

        "abstract": "Lin28 and Lin28B, two developmentally regulated RNA-binding proteins and likely proto-oncogenes, selectively inhibit the maturation of let-7 family microRNAs (miRNAs) in embryonic stem cells and certain cancer cell lines. Moreover, let-7 precursors (pre-let-7) were previously found to be terminally uridylated in a Lin28-dependent fashion. Here we identify Zcchc11 (zinc finger, CCHC domain containing 11) as the 3' terminal uridylyl transferase (TUTase) responsible for Lin28-mediated pre-let-7 uridylation and subsequent blockade of let-7 processing in mouse embryonic stem cells. We demonstrate that Zcchc11 activity is UTP-dependent, selective for let-7 and recruited by Lin28. Furthermore, knockdown of either Zcchc11 or Lin28, or overexpression of a catalytically inactive TUTase, relieves the selective inhibition of let-7 processing and leads to the accumulation of mature let-7 miRNAs and repression of let-7 target reporter genes. Our results establish a role for Zcchc11-catalyzed pre-let-7 uridylation in the control of miRNA biogenesis."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) inhibit mRNA expression in general by base pairing to the 3'UTR of target mRNAs and consequently inhibiting translation and/or initiating poly(A) tail deadenylation and mRNA destabilization. Here we examine the mechanism and kinetics of miRNA-mediated deadenylation in mouse Krebs-2 ascites extract. We demonstrate that miRNA-mediated mRNA deadenylation occurs subsequent to initial translational inhibition, indicating a two-step mechanism of miRNA action, which serves to consolidate repression. We show that a let-7 miRNA-loaded RNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC) interacts with the poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) and the CAF1 and CCR4 deadenylases. In addition, we demonstrate that miRNA-mediated deadenylation is dependent upon CAF1 activity and PABP, which serves as a bona fide miRNA coactivator. Importantly, we present evidence that GW182, a core component of the miRISC, directly interacts with PABP via its C-terminal region and that this interaction is required for miRNA-mediated deadenylation."

        "title": "Active turnover modulates mature microRNA activity in Caenorhabditis elegans.",
        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) constitute a large class of regulatory RNAs that repress target messenger RNAs to control various biological processes. Accordingly, miRNA biogenesis is highly regulated, controlled at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, and overexpression and underexpression of miRNAs are linked to various human diseases, particularly cancers. As RNA concentrations are generally a function of biogenesis and turnover, active miRNA degradation might also modulate miRNA accumulation, and the plant 3'-->5' exonuclease SDN1 has been implicated in miRNA turnover. Here we report that degradation of mature miRNAs in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, mediated by the 5'-->3' exoribonuclease XRN-2, affects functional miRNA homeostasis in vivo. We recapitulate XRN-2-dependent miRNA turnover in larval lysates, where processing of precursor-miRNA (pre-miRNA) by Dicer, unannealing of the miRNA duplex and loading of the mature miRNA into the Argonaute protein of the miRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC) are coupled processes that precede degradation of the mature miRNA. Although Argonaute:miRNA complexes are highly resistant to salt, larval lysate promotes efficient release of the miRNA, exposing it to degradation by XRN-2. Release and degradation can both be blocked by the addition of miRNA target RNA. Our results therefore suggest the presence of an additional layer of regulation of animal miRNA activity that might be important for rapid changes of miRNA expression profiles during developmental transitions and for the maintenance of steady-state concentrations of miRNAs. This pathway might represent a potential target for therapeutic intervention on miRNA expression."

        "title": "Anatomy of RISC: how do small RNAs and chaperones activate Argonaute proteins?",
        "abstract": "RNA silencing is a eukaryote-specific phenomenon in which microRNAs and small interfering RNAs degrade messenger RNAs containing a complementary sequence. To this end, these small RNAs need to be loaded onto an Argonaute protein (AGO protein) to form the effector complex referred to as RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). RISC assembly undergoes multiple and sequential steps with the aid of Hsc70/Hsp90 chaperone machinery. The molecular mechanisms for this assembly process remain unclear, despite their significance for the development of gene silencing techniques and RNA interference-based therapeutics. This review dissects the currently available structures of AGO proteins and proposes models and hypotheses for RISC assembly, covering the conformation of unloaded AGO proteins, the chaperone-assisted duplex loading, and the slicer-dependent and slicer-independent duplex separation. The differences in the properties of RISC between prokaryotes and eukaryotes will also be clarified.

        "title": "Regulation of microRNAs by natural agents: an emerging field in chemoprevention and chemotherapy research.",
        "abstract": "In recent years, microRNAs have received greater attention in cancer research. These small, non-coding RNAs could inhibit target gene expression by binding to the 3' untranslated region of target mRNA, resulting in either mRNA degradation or inhibition of translation. miRNAs play important roles in many normal biological processes; however, studies have also shown that aberrant miRNA expression is correlated with the development and progression of cancers. The miRNAs could have oncogenic or tumor suppressor activities. Moreover, some miRNAs could regulate formation of cancer stem cells and epithelial-mesenchymal transition phenotype of cancer cells which are typically drug resistant. Furthermore, miRNAs could be used as biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis, and thus miRNAs are becoming emerging targets for cancer therapy. Recent studies have shown that natural agents including curcumin, isoflavone, indole-3-carbinol, 3,3'-diindolylmethane, (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate, resveratrol, etc. could alter miRNA expression profiles, leading to the inhibition of cancer cell growth, induction of apoptosis, reversal of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, or enhancement of efficacy of conventional cancer therapeutics. These emerging results clearly suggest that specific targeting of miRNAs by natural agents could open newer avenues for complete eradication of tumors by killing the drug-resistant cells to improve survival outcome in patients diagnosed with malignancies."

        "abstract": "RNA interference (RNAi) is the mechanism through which double-stranded RNAs silence cognate genes. In plants, this can occur at both the transcriptional and the post-transcriptional levels; however, in animals, only post-transcriptional RNAi has been reported to date. In both plants and animals, RNAi is characterized by the presence of RNAs of about 22 nucleotides in length that are homologous to the gene that is being suppressed. These 22-nucleotide sequences serve as guide sequences that instruct a multicomponent nuclease, RISC, to destroy specific messenger RNAs. Here we identify an enzyme, Dicer, which can produce putative guide RNAs. Dicer is a member of the RNase III family of nucleases that specifically cleave double-stranded RNAs, and is evolutionarily conserved in worms, flies, plants, fungi and mammals. The enzyme has a distinctive structure, which includes a helicase domain and dual RNase III motifs. Dicer also contains a region of homology to the RDE1/QDE2/ARGONAUTE family that has been genetically linked to RNAi."

        "abstract": "Micro-RNAs (miRNAs) are regulatory molecules that mediate effects by interacting with messenger RNA (mRNA) targets. Here we show that Arabidopsis thaliana miRNA 39 (also known as miR171), a 21-ribonucleotide species that accumulates predominantly in inflorescence tissues, is produced from an intergenic region in chromosome III and functionally interacts with mRNA targets encoding several members of the Scarecrow-like (SCL) family of putative transcription factors. miRNA 39 is complementary to an internal region of three SCL mRNAs. The interaction results in specific cleavage of target mRNA within the region of complementarity, indicating that this class of miRNA functions like small interfering RNA associated with RNA silencing to guide sequence-specific cleavage in a developmentally controlled manner."

We identified a gene, TWI1, in Tetrahymena thermophila that is homologous to piwi and is required for DNA elimination. We also found that small RNAs were specifically expressed prior to chromosome rearrangement during conjugation. These RNAs were not observed in TWI1 knockout cells and required PDD1, another gene required for rearrangement, for expression. We propose that these small RNAs function to specify sequences to be eliminated by a mechanism similar to RNA-mediated gene silencing."

        "abstract": "RNA interference (RNAi) regulates gene expression by the cleavage of messenger RNA, by mRNA degradation and by preventing protein synthesis. These effects are mediated by a ribonucleoprotein complex known as RISC (RNA-induced silencing complex). We have previously identified four Drosophila components (short interfering RNAs, Argonaute 2 (ref. 2), VIG and FXR) of a RISC enzyme that degrades specific mRNAs in response to a double-stranded-RNA trigger. Here we show that Tudor-SN (tudor staphylococcal nuclease)--a protein containing five staphylococcal/micrococcal nuclease domains and a tudor domain--is a component of the RISC enzyme in Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila and mammals. Although Tudor-SN contains non-canonical active-site sequences, we show that purified Tudor-SN exhibits nuclease activity similar to that of other staphylococcal nucleases. Notably, both purified Tudor-SN and RISC are inhibited by a specific competitive inhibitor of micrococcal nuclease. Tudor-SN is the first RISC subunit to be identified that contains a recognizable nuclease domain, and could therefore contribute to the RNA degradation observed in RNAi."

        "title": "The nuclear RNase III Drosha initiates microRNA processing.",
        "abstract": "Hundreds of small RNAs of approximately 22 nucleotides, collectively named microRNAs (miRNAs), have been discovered recently in animals and plants. Although their functions are being unravelled, their mechanism of biogenesis remains poorly understood. miRNAs are transcribed as long primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs) whose maturation occurs through sequential processing events: the nuclear processing of the pri-miRNAs into stem-loop precursors of approximately 70 nucleotides (pre-miRNAs), and the cytoplasmic processing of pre-miRNAs into mature miRNAs. Dicer, a member of the RNase III superfamily of bidentate nucleases, mediates the latter step, whereas the processing enzyme for the former step is unknown. Here we identify another RNase III, human Drosha, as the core nuclease that executes the initiation step of miRNA processing in the nucleus. Immunopurified Drosha cleaved pri-miRNA to release pre-miRNA in vitro. Furthermore, RNA interference of Drosha resulted in the strong accumulation of pri-miRNA and the reduction of pre-miRNA and mature miRNA in vivo. Thus, the two RNase III proteins, Drosha and Dicer, may collaborate in the stepwise processing of miRNAs, and have key roles in miRNA-mediated gene regulation in processes such as development and differentiation."

        "abstract": "Dicer is an RNaseIII-like enzyme that is required for generating short interfering RNAs and microRNAs. The latter have been implicated in regulating cell fate determination in invertebrates and vertebrates. To test the requirement for Dicer in cell-lineage decisions in a mammalian organism, we have generated a conditional allele of dicer-1 (dcr-1) in the mouse. Specific deletion of dcr-1 in the T cell lineage resulted in impaired T cell development and aberrant T helper cell differentiation and cytokine production. A severe block in peripheral CD8(+) T cell development was observed upon dcr-1 deletion in the thymus. However, Dicer-deficient CD4(+) T cells, although reduced in numbers, were viable and could be analyzed further. These cells were defective in microRNA processing, and upon stimulation they proliferated poorly and underwent increased apoptosis. Independent of their proliferation defect, Dicer-deficient helper T cells preferentially expressed interferon-gamma, the hallmark effector cytokine of the Th1 lineage."

The siRNA-generating enzyme was purified from Drosophila S2cells and consists of two stoichiometric subunits: Dicer-2(DCR-2) and a previously unknown protein that we named R2D2. R2D2 is homologous to the Caenorhabditis elegans RNAi protein RDE-4. Association with R2D2 does not affect the enzymatic activity of DCR-2. Rather, the DCR-2/R2D2 complex, but not DCR-2 alone, binds to siRNA and enhances sequence-specific messenger RNA degradation mediated by the RNA-initiated silencing complex (RISC). These results indicate that R2D2 bridges the initiation and effector steps of the Drosophila RNAi pathway by facilitating siRNA passage from Dicer to RISC."

        "abstract": "Plant development is characterized by precise control of gene regulation, leading to the correct spatial and temporal tissue patterning. We have characterized the Arabidopsis jabba-1D (jba-1D) mutant, which displays multiple enlarged shoot meristems, radialized leaves, reduced gynoecia and vascular defects. The jba-1D meristem phenotypes require WUSCHEL (WUS) activity, and correlate with a dramatic increase in WUS expression levels. We demonstrate that the jba-1D phenotypes are caused by over-expression of miR166g, and require the activity of the RNase III helicase DCL1. miR166g over-expression in jba-1D plants affects the transcripts of several class III homeodomain-leucine zipper (AtHD-ZIP) family target genes. The expression of PHABULOSA (PHB), PHAVOLUTA (PHV) and CORONA (CNA) is significantly reduced in a jba-1D background, while REVOLUTA (REV) expression is elevated and ATHB8 is unchanged. In addition, we show that miR166 has a dynamic expression pattern in wild-type and jba-1D embryos. Our analysis demonstrates an indirect role for miRNAs in controlling meristem formation via regulation of WUS expression, and reveals complex regulation of the class III AtHD-ZIP gene family."

        "abstract": "The upper side of the angiosperm leaf is specialized for efficient capture of sunlight whereas the lower side is specialized for gas exchange. In Arabidopsis, the establishment of polarity in the leaf probably requires the generation and perception of positional information along the radial (adaxial versus abaxial or central versus peripheral) dimension of the plant. This is because the future upper (adaxial) side of the leaf develops from cells closer to the centre of the shoot, whereas the future under (abaxial) side develops from cells located more peripherally. Here we implicate the Arabidopsis PHABULOSA and PHAVOLUTA genes in the perception of radial positional information in the leaf primordium. Dominant phabulosa (phb) and phavoluta (phv) mutations cause a dramatic transformation of abaxial leaf fates into adaxial leaf fates. They do so by altering the predicted sterol/lipid-binding domains of ATHB14 and ATHB9, proteins of previously unknown function that also contain DNA-binding motifs. This change probably renders the protein constitutively active, implicating this domain as a central regulator of protein function and the PHB and PHV proteins as receptors for an adaxializing signal."

        "abstract": "The study of a class of small non-coding RNA molecules, named microRNAs (miRNAs), has advanced our understanding of many of the fundamental processes of cancer biology and the molecular mechanisms underlying tumor initiation and progression. MiRNA research has become more and more attractive as evidence is emerging that miRNAs likely play important regulatory roles virtually in all essential bioprocesses. Looking at this field over the past decade it becomes evident that our understanding of miRNAs remains rather incomplete. As research continues to reveal the mechanisms underlying cancer therapy efficacy, it is clear that miRNAs contribute to responses to drug therapy and are themselves modified by drug therapy. One important area for miRNA research is to understand the functions of miRNAs and the relevant signaling pathways in the initiation, progression and drug-resistance of tumors to be able to design novel, effective targeted therapeutics that directly target pathologically essential miRNAs and/or their target genes. Another area of increasing importance is the use of miRNA signatures in the diagnosis and prognosis of various types of cancers. As the study of non-coding RNAs is increasingly more popular and important, it is without doubt that the next several years of miRNA research will provide more fascinating results."

Given their role as post-transcriptional gene expression regulators, they are involved in several important physiological processes like development, cell differentiation and cell signaling. miRNAs act as modulators of gene expression programs in different diseases, particularly in cancer, where they act through the repression of genes which are critical for carcinogenesis. The expression level of mature miRNAs is the result of a fine mechanism of biogenesis, carried out by different enzymatic complexes that exert their function at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. In this review, we will focus our discussion on the alterations in the miRNA biogenesis machinery, and its impact on the establishment and development of cancer programs."

Studies querying miRNA functions by overexpressing or silencing specific miRNAs have yielded data that are often at odds with those collected from loss-of-functions models. In addition, knockout studies suggest that many conserved miRNAs are dispensable for animal development or viability. In this review, we discuss these observations in the context of our current knowledge of miRNA biology and review the evidence implicating miRNA-mediated gene regulation in the mechanisms that ensure biological robustness."

The high level of complementarity between plant microRNAs and their target mRNAs has allowed rapid progress towards the elucidation of their varied biological functions. MicroRNAs have been shown to regulate diverse developmental processes, including organ separation, polarity, and identity, and to modulate their own biogenesis and function. Recently, they have also been implicated in some processes outside of plant development."

        "abstract": "Over the past few years, microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as abundant regulators of gene expression. Like many transcription factors (TFs), miRNAs are important determinants of cellular fate specification. Here I provide a conceptual framework for miRNA action in the context of creating cellular diversity in a developing organism, and emphasize the conceptual similarity of TF- and miRNA-mediated control of gene expression. Both TFs and miRNAs are trans-acting factors that exert their activity through composite cis-regulatory elements that are 'hard-wired' into DNA or RNA. TFs and miRNAs act in a largely combinatorial manner - that is, many different TFs or miRNAs control one gene - and they act cooperatively on their targets - that is, there are several cis-regulatory elements for a single TF or miRNA species in a target gene. Just as the set of TFs in a given cell type has been proposed to constitute a 'code' that specifies cellular differentiation, so 'miRNA codes' are likely to have conceptually similar roles in the specification of cell types."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are approximately 21-nt-long RNAs involved in regulating development, differentiation, and other processes in eukaryotes. In metazoa, nearly all miRNAs control gene expression by imperfectly base-pairing with the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of target mRNAs and repressing protein synthesis by an unknown mechanism. It is also unknown whether miRNA-mRNA duplexes containing mismatches and bulges provide specific features that are recognized by factors mediating the repression. miRNAs form part of ribonucleoprotein complexes, miRNPs, that contain Argonaute (Ago) and other proteins. Here we demonstrate that effects of miRNAs on translation can be mimicked in human HeLa cells by the miRNA-independent tethering of Ago proteins to the 3'-UTR of a reporter mRNA. Inhibition of protein synthesis occurred without a change in the reporter mRNA level and was dependent on the number, but not the position, of the hairpins tethering hAgo2 to the 3'-UTR. These findings indicate that a primary function of miRNAs is to guide their associated proteins to the mRNA."

Maturation of miRNAs involves cleavage of longer primary transcripts, but little is yet understood about how miRNA genes are transcribed and enter the processing pathway. We find that relatively long, polyadenylated transcripts encoded by the Caenorhabditis elegans let-7 gene undergo trans-splicing to the spliced leader 1 (SL1) RNA. Deletions, including removal of the trans-splice site, upstream of mature let-7 sequence result in stable accumulation of primary transcripts and compromised production of mature let-7 RNA in vivo. Our data show that multiple steps of let-7 miRNA biogenesis can be uncoupled, allowing for complex regulation in the production of a functional miRNA. Finally, the observation that let-7 primary transcripts undergo splicing highlights the importance of identifying the sequence of endogenous pri-miRNA substrates recognized by the cellular processing machinery."

        "abstract": "The biogenesis and function of mature human microRNAs is dependent on the nuclear export of pre-microRNA precursors by Exportin 5 (Exp5). The precursor for the human miR-30 microRNA, which is a 63 nt long RNA hairpin bearing a 2 nt 3' overhang, forms a specific complex with Exp5 and the Ran-GTP cofactor. Here, we have examined the structural requirements for pre-microRNA binding by Exp5. Our data indicate that pre-miR-30 binding requires an RNA stem of >16 bp and is facilitated by a 3' overhang. Although a blunt-ended derivative of the pre-miR-30 stem-loop remained capable of binding Exp5, 5' overhangs were inhibitory. miR-30 variants that had lost the ability to bind Exp5 effectively were not efficiently exported from the nucleus and were also expressed at reduced levels. Furthermore, formation of a pre-microRNA/Exp5/Ran-GTP complex inhibited exonucleolytic digestion of the pre-miRNA in vitro. Together, these data demonstrate that pre-microRNA binding by Exp5 involves recognition of almost all of the RNA hairpin, with the exception of the terminal loop. Moreover, these results argue that Exp5 binding not only mediates pre-microRNA nuclear export but also prevents nuclear pre-microRNA degradation."

Since their discovery as regulators of developmental timing in Caenorhabditis elegans, hundreds of miRNAs have been identified in both animals and plants. Here, we report a technique for visualizing detailed miRNA expression patterns in mouse embryos. We elucidate the tissue-specific expression of several miRNAs during embryogenesis, including two encoded by genes embedded in homeobox (Hox) clusters, miR-10a and miR-196a. These two miRNAs are expressed in patterns that are markedly reminiscent of those of Hox genes. Furthermore, miR-196a negatively regulates Hoxb8, indicating that its restricted expression pattern probably reflects a role in the patterning function of the Hox complex."

        "abstract": "To derive a global perspective on the transcription of microRNAs (miRNAs) in mammals, we annotated the genomic position and context of this class of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) in the human and mouse genomes. Of the 232 known mammalian miRNAs, we found that 161 overlap with 123 defined transcription units (TUs). We identified miRNAs within introns of 90 protein-coding genes with a broad spectrum of molecular functions, and in both introns and exons of 66 mRNA-like noncoding RNAs (mlncRNAs). In addition, novel families of miRNAs based on host gene identity were identified. The transcription patterns of all miRNA host genes were curated from a variety of sources illustrating spatial, temporal, and physiological regulation of miRNA expression. These findings strongly suggest that miRNAs are transcribed in parallel with their host transcripts, and that the two different transcription classes of miRNAs ('exonic' and 'intronic') identified here may require slightly different mechanisms of biogenesis."

Accumulating evidence also indicates the involvement of miRNA alterations in various types of human cancer, including lung cancer, which has long been the leading cause of cancer death in economically well-developed countries, including Japan. We previously found that downregulation of members of the tumor-suppressive let-7 miRNA family and overexpression of the oncogenic miR-17-92 miRNA cluster frequently occur in lung cancers, and molecular insight into how these miRNA alterations may contribute to tumor development has been rapidly accumulating. The present review summarizes recent advances in elucidation of the molecular functions of these miRNA in relation to their roles in the pathogenesis of lung cancer. Given the crucial roles of miRNA alterations, additional studies are expected to provide a better understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms of disease development, as well as a foundation for novel strategies for cancer diagnosis and treatment of this devastating disease."

        "title": "[MicroRNAs and intestinal pathophysiology].",
        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) represent an abundant class of endogenously expressed small RNAs, which is believed to control the expression of proteins through specific interaction with their mRNAs. MiRNAs are non-coding RNAs of 18 to 24 nucleotides that negatively regulate target mRNAs by binding to their 3'-untranslated regions (UTR). Most eukaryotic cells utilize miRNA to regulate vital functions such as cell differentiation, proliferation or apopotosis. The diversity of miRNAs and of their mRNA targets strongly indicate that they play a key role in the regulation of protein expression. To date, more than 500 different miRNAs have been identified in animals and plants. There are at least 326 miRNAs in the human genome, comprising 1-4% of all expressed human genes, which makes miRNAs one of the largest classes of gene regulators. A single miRNA can bind to and regulate many different mRNA targets and, conversely, several different miRNAs can bind to and cooperatively control a single mRNA target. The correlation between the expression of miRNAs and their effects on tumorigenesis and on the proliferation of cancer cells is beginning to gain experimental evidences. Recent studies showed that abnormal expression of miRNAs represents a common feature of cancer cells and that they can function as tumor suppressor genes or as oncogenes. Therefore, this diversity of action for miRNAs on several target genes could be one of the common mechanisms involved in the deregulation of protein expression observed during intestinal disorders. In this review, the emergent functions of miRNAs in colorectal cancer and their potential role in the intestinal inflammatory process are discussed."

They can regulate their targets directly by mRNA cleavage or by repressing their translation, depending on the degree of complementariety between the miRNA and the target. Recent evidences have shown that miRNA control cell growth, apoptosis, and differentiation. Moreover, miRNA expression correlates with cancers and could have a crucial function in tumor progression. Bioinformatic data indicates that each miRNA can control hundreds of target genes, but identification of the accurate miRNA targets will be crucial to exploit the emerging knowledge of miRNA contribution to cancer process. While the miRNA field is still emerging, the benefit of our understanding of miRNA in cancer is potentially enormous, especially if we are able to apply this knowledge to provide new therapies for patients."

This novel class of molecules modulates a wide array of growth and differentiation processes in human cancers. High throughput analyses, utilizing the solid phase, array platform, or liquid phase, bead-based hybridization have variously demonstrated that miRNA expression was commonly dysregulated in human cancer. miRNA expression profiling has shown promise in defining malignant status in retrospective studies. Considerable disagreement remains with respect to the miRNA signature for a specific cancer cell type, which appears to depend largely on the analytical platform. Nonetheless, various internally controlled studies have successfully identified the histotype of tumors of unknown origin according to miRNA expression profile.

More than 400 miRNAs have been identified in humans and are evolutionally conserved from plants to animals. It has been revealed that miRNAs regulate various biological processes, such as development, cell differentiation, cell proliferation, and cell death. It is predicted that 30% of protein-encoding genes are regulated by miRNAs. Inappropriate expression of miRNAs has been found in cancer. Especially, the expression level of miRNAs that act like anti-oncogenes is frequently reduced in cancers because of chromosome aberrations. In addition, since the processing of miRNAs has been characterized to be enzymatic in nature, the expression levels of miRNAs are closely associated with the activity and levels of such enzymes. In this review, we discuss recent remarkable advances in miRNA biogenesis, bio-networking involving miRNAs, and their roles in carcinogenesis. Further, we discuss the expression of miRNA-143 and -145 in colon cancer and their roles in carcinogenesis. The available data suggest that miRNAs would be potentially useful as diagnostic and therapeutic tools."

Despite rapid progress in miRNA discovery, the physiologic functions of only a small number have been definitively established.

        "title": "Drosophila miR2 induces pseudo-polysomes and inhibits translation initiation.",
        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRs) inhibit protein synthesis by mechanisms that are as yet unresolved. We developed a cell-free system from Drosophila melanogaster embryos that faithfully recapitulates miR2-mediated translational control by means of the 3' untranslated region of the D. melanogaster reaper messenger RNA. Here we show that miR2 inhibits translation initiation without affecting mRNA stability. Surprisingly, miR2 induces the formation of dense (heavier than 80S) miRNPs ('pseudo-polysomes') even when polyribosome formation and 60S ribosomal subunit joining are blocked. An mRNA bearing an ApppG instead of an m7GpppG cap structure escapes the miR2-mediated translational block. These results directly show the inhibition of m7GpppG cap-mediated translation initiation as the mechanism of miR2 function, and uncover pseudo-polysomal messenger ribonucleoprotein assemblies that may help to explain earlier findings."

        "title": "MicroRNA silencing through RISC recruitment of eIF6.",
        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small RNAs that act post-transcriptionally to regulate messenger RNA stability and translation. To elucidate how miRNAs mediate their repressive effects, we performed biochemical and functional assays to identify new factors in the miRNA pathway. Here we show that human RISC (RNA-induced silencing complex) associates with a multiprotein complex containing MOV10--which is the homologue of Drosophila translational repressor Armitage--and proteins of the 60S ribosome subunit. Notably, this complex contains the anti-association factor eIF6 (also called ITGB4BP or p27BBP), a ribosome inhibitory protein known to prevent productive assembly of the 80S ribosome. Depletion of eIF6 in human cells specifically abrogates miRNA-mediated regulation of target protein and mRNA levels. Similarly, depletion of eIF6 in Caenorhabditis elegans diminishes lin-4 miRNA-mediated repression of the endogenous LIN-14 and LIN-28 target protein and mRNA levels. These results uncover an evolutionarily conserved function of the ribosome anti-association factor eIF6 in miRNA-mediated post-transcriptional silencing."

        "abstract": "Numerous miRNAs are deregulated in human cancers, and experimental evidence indicates that they can play roles as oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes. Similarly to cancer genes that encode proteins, deregulation of miRNA-encoding genes is associated with genetic or epigenetic alterations, such as deletions, amplifications, point mutations and aberrant DNA methylation. The discovery that miRNAs interact with known oncogenes has established further links with molecular pathways implicated in malignant transformation. Finally, miRNAs can be used as diagnostic markers, and their potential as therapeutic molecules has moved miRNAs from the area of basic research to the field of cancer biotechnology."

        "title": "Energizing miRNA research: a review of the role of miRNAs in lipid metabolism, with a prediction that miR-103/107 regulates human metabolic pathways.",
        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are powerful regulators of gene expression. Although first discovered in worm larvae, miRNAs play fundamental biological roles-including in humans-well beyond development. MiRNAs participate in the regulation of metabolism (including lipid metabolism) for all animal species studied. A review of the fascinating and fast-growing literature on miRNA regulation of metabolism can be parsed into three main categories: (1) adipocyte biochemistry and cell fate determination; (2) regulation of metabolic biochemistry in invertebrates; and (3) regulation of metabolic biochemistry in mammals. Most research into the 'function' of a given miRNA in metabolic pathways has concentrated on a given miRNA acting upon a particular 'target' mRNA. Whereas in some biological contexts the effects of a given miRNA:mRNA pair may predominate, this might not be the case generally. In order to provide an example of how a single miRNA could regulate multiple 'target' mRNAs or even entire human metabolic pathways, we include a discussion of metabolic pathways that are predicted to be regulated by the miRNA paralogs, miR-103 and miR-107. These miRNAs, which exist in vertebrate genomes within introns of the pantothenate kinase (PANK) genes, are predicted by bioinformatics to affect multiple mRNA targets in pathways that involve cellular Acetyl-CoA and lipid levels. Significantly, PANK enzymes also affect these pathways, so the miRNA and 'host' gene may act synergistically. These predictions require experimental verification. In conclusion, a review of the literature on miRNA regulation of metabolism leads us believe that the future will provide researchers with many additional energizing revelations."

        "abstract": "microRNAs (miRNAs) bind to Argonaute (Ago) proteins and inhibit translation or promote degradation of mRNA targets. Human let-7 miRNA inhibits translation initiation of mRNA targets in an m(7)G cap-dependent manner and also appears to block protein production, but the molecular mechanism(s) involved is unknown and the role of Ago proteins in translational regulation remains elusive. Here we identify a motif (MC) within the Mid domain of Ago proteins, which bears significant similarity to the m(7)G cap-binding domain of eIF4E, an essential translation initiation factor. We identify conserved aromatic residues within the MC motif of human Ago2 that are required for binding to the m(7)G cap and for translational repression but do not affect the assembly of Ago2 with miRNA or its catalytic activity. We propose that Ago2 represses the initiation of mRNA translation by binding to the m(7)G cap of mRNA targets, thus likely precluding the recruitment of eIF4E."

        "abstract": "Small noncoding RNAs function in concert with Argonaute (Ago) proteins to regulate gene expression at the level of transcription, mRNA stability, or translation. Ago proteins bind small RNAs and form the core of silencing complexes. Here, we report the analysis of small RNAs associated with human Ago1 and Ago2 revealed by immunoprecipitation and deep sequencing. Among the reads, we find small RNAs originating from the small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) ACA45. Moreover, processing of ACA45 requires Dicer activity but is independent of Drosha/DGCR8. Using bioinformatic prediction algorithms and luciferase reporter assays, we uncover the mediator subunit CDC2L6 as one potential mRNA target of ACA45 small RNAs, suggesting a role for ACA45-processing products in posttranscriptional gene silencing. We further identify a number of human snoRNAs with microRNA (miRNA)-like processing signatures. We have, therefore, identified a class of small RNAs in human cells that originate from snoRNAs and can function like miRNAs."

        "title": "Deadenylation is a widespread effect of miRNA regulation.",
        "abstract": "miRNAs silence gene expression by repressing translation and/or by promoting mRNA decay. In animal cells, degradation of partially complementary miRNA targets occurs via deadenylation by the CAF1-CCR4-NOT1 deadenylase complex, followed by decapping and subsequent exonucleolytic digestion. To determine how generally miRNAs trigger deadenylation, we compared mRNA expression profiles in D. melanogaster cells depleted of AGO1, CAF1, or NOT1. We show that approximately 60% of AGO1 targets are regulated by CAF1 and/or NOT1, indicating that deadenylation is a widespread effect of miRNA regulation. However, neither a poly(A) tail nor mRNA circularization are required for silencing, because mRNAs whose 3' ends are generated by a self-cleaving ribozyme are also silenced in vivo. We show further that miRNAs trigger mRNA degradation, even when binding by 40S ribosomal subunits is inhibited in cis. These results indicate that miRNAs promote mRNA decay by altering mRNP composition and/or conformation, rather than by directly interfering with the binding and function of ribosomal subunits."

        "abstract": "Analysis of the human genome indicates that a large fraction of the genome sequences are RNAs that do not encode any proteins, also known as non-coding RNAs. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a group of small non-coding RNA molecules 20-22 nucleotides (nt) in length that are predicted to control the activity of approximately 30% of all protein-coding genes in mammals. miRNAs play important roles in many diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and immune disorders. The expression of miRNAs can be regulated by epigenetic modification, DNA copy number change, and genetic mutations. miRNAs can serve as a valuable therapeutic target for a large number of diseases. For miRNAs with oncogenic capabilities, potential therapies include miRNA silencing, antisense blocking, and miRNA modifications. For miRNAs with tumor suppression functions, overexpression of those miRNAs might be a useful strategy to inhibit tumor growth. In this review, we discuss the current progress of miRNA research, regulation of miRNA expression, prediction of miRNA targets, and regulatory role of miRNAs in human physiology and diseases, with a specific focus on miRNAs in pancreatic cancer, liver cancer, colorectal cancer, cardiovascular disease, the immune system, and infectious disease. This review provides valuable information for clinicians and researchers who want to recognize the newest advances in this new field and identify possible lines of investigation in miRNAs as important mediators in human physiology and diseases."

        "abstract": "microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate the expression of mRNAs in animals and plants through miRNA-containing ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs). At the core of these miRNA silencing effector complexes are the Argonaute (AGO) proteins that bind miRNAs and mediate target mRNA recognition. We generated HEK293 cell lines stably expressing epitope-tagged human AGO proteins and other RNA silencing-related proteins and used these cells to purify miRNA-containing RNPs. Mass spectrometric analyses of the proteins associated with different AGO proteins revealed a common set of helicases and mRNA-binding proteins, among them the three trinucleotide repeat containing proteins 6 (TNRC6A,-B,-C). mRNA microarray analyses of these miRNA-associated RNPs revealed that AGO and TNRC6 proteins bind highly similar sets of transcripts enriched in binding sites for highly expressed endogenous miRNAs, indicating that the TNRC6 proteins are a component of the mRNA-targeting miRNA silencing complex. Together with the very similar proteomic composition of each AGO complex, this result suggests substantial functional redundancy within families of human AGO and TNRC6 proteins. Our results further demonstrate that we have developed an effective biochemical approach to identify physiologically relevant human miRNA targets."

        "abstract": "RNA interference (RNAi) is the process of sequence-specific, post-transcriptional gene silencing in animals and plants, initiated by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) that is homologous in sequence to the silenced gene. The mediators of sequence-specific messenger RNA degradation are 21- and 22-nucleotide small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) generated by ribonuclease III cleavage from longer dsRNAs. Here we show that 21-nucleotide siRNA duplexes specifically suppress expression of endogenous and heterologous genes in different mammalian cell lines, including human embryonic kidney (293) and HeLa cells. Therefore, 21-nucleotide siRNA duplexes provide a new tool for studying gene function in mammalian cells and may eventually be used as gene-specific therapeutics."

Important functions for microRNAs have been found in the regulation of development, cellular proliferation and differentiation, while perturbed miRNA expression patterns have been observed in many human cancers. Here we present a method for specific inhibition of miRNA function through interaction with LNA-modified antisense oligonucleotides and report the specificity of this application. We show that LNA-modified oligonucleotides can inhibit exogenously introduced miRNAs with high specificity using a heterologous reporter assay, and furthermore demonstrate their ability to inhibit an endogenous miRNA in Drosophila melanogaster cells, leading to up-regulation of the cognate target protein. The method shows stoichiometric and reliable inhibition of the targeted miRNA and can thus be applied to studies of miRNA functions and validation of putative target genes."

        "abstract": "The role of small RNAs as key regulators of mRNA turnover and translation has been well established. Recent advances indicate that the small RNAs termed microRNAs play important roles in animal development and physiology. Cellular activities such as proliferation, morphogenesis, apoptosis and differentiation are regulated by microRNAs. The expression of various genes are regulated by microRNAs, and several microRNAs act in reciprocal negative feedback loops with protein factors to control cell fate decisions that are triggered by signal transduction activity. These observations implicate small RNAs as important mediators of gene regulation in response to cell-cell signaling. The mechanism by which microRNAs silence gene expression is post-transcriptional, possibly influencing the stability, compartmentalization and translation of mRNAs. This mechanism is an efficient means to regulate production of a diverse range of proteins."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small noncoding RNAs that have important regulatory roles in multicellular organisms. The public miRNA database contains 321 human miRNA sequences, 234 of which have been experimentally verified. To explore the possibility that additional miRNAs are present in the human genome, we have developed an experimental approach called miRNA serial analysis of gene expression (miRAGE) and used it to perform the largest experimental analysis of human miRNAs to date. Sequence analysis of 273,966 small RNA tags from human colorectal cells allowed us to identify 200 known mature miRNAs, 133 novel miRNA candidates, and 112 previously uncharacterized miRNA* forms. To aid in the evaluation of candidate miRNAs, we disrupted the Dicer locus in three human colorectal cancer cell lines and examined known and novel miRNAs in these cells. These studies suggest that the human genome contains many more miRNAs than currently identified and provide an approach for the large-scale experimental cloning of novel human miRNAs in human tissues."

It is now clear that small RNA molecules are common and effective modulators of gene expression in many eukaryotic cells. These small RNAs that control gene expression can be either endogenous or exogenous micro RNAs (miRNAs) and short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and can affect mRNA degradation and translation, as well as chromatin structure, thereby having impacts on transcription rates. In this review, we discuss possible mechanisms by which miRNAs control translation and mRNA degradation. An emerging theme is that miRNAs, and siRNAs to some extent, target mRNAs to the general eukaryotic machinery for mRNA degradation and translation control."

        "abstract": "The basis of eukaryotic complexity is an intricate genetic architecture where parallel systems are involved in tuning gene expression, via RNA-DNA, RNA-RNA, RNA-protein, and DNA-protein interactions. In higher organisms, about 97% of the transcriptional output is represented by noncoding RNA (ncRNA) encompassing not only rRNA, tRNA, introns, 5' and 3' untranslated regions, transposable elements, and intergenic regions, but also a large, rapidly emerging family named microRNAs. MicroRNAs are short 20-22-nucleotide RNA molecules that have been shown to regulate the expression of other genes in a variety of eukaryotic systems. MicroRNAs are formed from larger transcripts that fold to produce hairpin structures and serve as substrates for the cytoplasmic Dicer, a member of the RNase III enzyme family. A recent analysis of the genomic location of human microRNA genes suggested that 50% of microRNA genes are located in cancer-associated genomic regions or in fragile sites. This review focuses on the possible implications of microRNAs in post-transcriptional gene regulation in mammalian diseases, with particular focus on cancer. We argue that developing mouse models for deleted and/or overexpressed microRNAs will be of invaluable interest to decipher the regulatory networks where microRNAs are involved."

High hsa-mir-155 and low hsa-let-7a-2 expression correlated with poor survival by univariate analysis as well as multivariate analysis for hsa-mir-155. The miRNA expression signature on outcome was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR analysis of precursor miRNAs and cross-validated with an independent set of adenocarcinomas.

We present in vivo and in vitro evidence that in Drosophila melanogaster a developmentally regulated precursor RNA is cleaved by an RNA interference-like mechanism to produce mature let-7 stRNA. Targeted destruction in cultured human cells of the messenger RNA encoding the enzyme Dicer, which acts in the RNA interference pathway, leads to accumulation of the let-7 precursor. Thus, the RNA interference and stRNA pathways intersect. Both pathways require the RNA-processing enzyme Dicer to produce the active small-RNA component that represses gene expression."

        "abstract": "RNAi is a gene-silencing phenomenon triggered by double-stranded (ds) RNA and involves the generation of 21 to 26 nt RNA segments that guide mRNA destruction. In Caenorhabditis elegans, lin-4 and let-7 encode small temporal RNAs (stRNAs) of 22 nt that regulate stage-specific development. Here we show that inactivation of genes related to RNAi pathway genes, a homolog of Drosophila Dicer (dcr-1), and two homologs of rde-1 (alg-1 and alg-2), cause heterochronic phenotypes similar to lin-4 and let-7 mutations. Further we show that dcr-1, alg-1, and alg-2 are necessary for the maturation and activity of the lin-4 and let-7 stRNAs. Our findings suggest that a common processing machinery generates guide RNAs that mediate both RNAi and endogenous gene regulation."

Cotransfection experiments revealed that Su(Ste) dsRNA can target and eliminate Stellate transcripts in Drosophila cell culture. The short fragment of Stellate gene that is homologous to Su(Ste) was shown to be sufficient to confer Su(Ste)-dependent silencing of a reporter construct in testes. We demonstrated that Su(Ste) dsRNA-mediated silencing affects not only Stellate expression but also the level of sense Su(Ste) RNA providing a negative autogenous regulation of Su(Ste) expression.

These small non-coding RNAs exert their effects in the context of complex regulatory networks, often made all the more extensive by the inclusion of transcription factors as their direct targets. In recent years, the increased availability of gene expression data and the development of methodologies that profile miRNA targets en masse have fuelled our understanding of miRNA functions, and of the sources and consequences of miRNA dysregulation. Advances in experimental and computational approaches are revealing not just cancer pathways controlled by single miRNAs but also intermeshed regulatory networks controlled by multiple miRNAs, which often engage in reciprocal feedback interactions with the targets that they regulate."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as key genetic regulators of a wide variety of biological processes, including growth, proliferation, and survival. Recent advances have led to the recognition that miRNAs can act as potent oncogenes and tumor suppressors, playing crucial roles in the initiation, maintenance, and progression of the oncogenic state in a variety of cancers. Determining how miRNA expression and function is altered in cancer is an important goal, and a necessary prerequisite to the development and adoption of miRNA-based therapeutics in the clinic. Highly promising clinical applications of miRNAs are the use of miRNA signatures as biomarkers for cancer (for example, for early detection or diagnosis), and therapeutic supplementation or inhibition of specific miRNAs to alter the cancer phenotype. In this review, we discuss the main methods used for miRNA profiling, and examine key miRNAs that are commonly altered in a variety of tumors. Current studies underscore the functional versatility and potency of miRNAs in various aspects of the cancer phenotype, pointing to their potential clinical applications. Consequently, we discuss the application of miRNAs as biomarkers, clinical agents, and therapeutic targets, highlighting both the enormous potential and major challenges in this field."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small regulatory RNAs that act in an entangled web of interactions with target mRNAs to shape the cellular protein landscape by post-transcriptional control of mRNA decay and translation. miRNAs are themselves subject to numerous regulatory mechanisms that adjust their prevalence and activity. Emerging evidence suggests that miRNAs are themselves targeted by regulatory RNA species, and the identification of several classes of noncoding RNA molecules carrying miRNA binding sites has added a new intricate dimension to miRNA regulation. Such miRNA 'sponges' bind miRNAs and competitively sequester them from their natural targets. Endogenous miRNA sponges, also termed competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs), act to buffer the activity of miRNAs on physiologically relevant targets. This class of sponges includes endogenously transcribed pseudogenes, long noncoding RNAs, and recently discovered circular RNAs and may act in large complex networks in conjunction with miRNAs to regulate the output of protein. With the growing demand of regulating miRNA activity for experimental purposes and potential future clinical use, naturally occurring miRNA sponges are providing inspiration for engineering of gene vector-encoded sponges as potent inhibitors of miRNA activity. Combined with potent and versatile vector technologies, expression of custom-designed sponges provides new means of managing miRNAs and soaking up miRNAs for therapeutic regulation of gene expression."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are approximately 22-nt RNA segments that are involved in the regulation of protein expression primarily by binding to one or more target sites on an mRNA transcript and inhibiting translation. MicroRNAs are likely to factor into multiple developmental pathways, multiple mechanisms of gene regulation, and underlie an array of inherited disease processes and phenotypic determinants. Several computational programs exist to predict miRNA targets in mammals, fruit flies, worms, and plants. However, to date, there is no systematic collection and description of miRNA targets with experimental support. We describe a database, TarBase, which houses a manually curated collection of experimentally tested miRNA targets, in human/mouse, fruit fly, worm, and zebrafish, distinguishing between those that tested positive and those that tested negative. Each positive target site is described by the miRNA that binds it, the gene in which it occurs, the nature of the experiments that were conducted to test it, the sufficiency of the site to induce translational repression and/or cleavage, and the paper from which all these data were extracted. Additionally, the database is functionally linked to several other useful databases such as Gene Ontology (GO) and UCSC Genome Browser. TarBase reveals significantly more experimentally supported targets than even recent reviews claim, thereby providing a comprehensive data set from which to assess features of miRNA targeting that will be useful for the next generation of target prediction programs. TarBase can be accessed at http://www.diana.pcbi.upenn.edu/tarbase."

Recent studies have shown that the expression of many miRNAs is altered in various human tumors and some miRNAs may function as oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes. However, with the exception of glioblastoma multiforme, the expression of miRNAs in brain tumors is unknown. Furthermore, methods to profile miRNAs from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) archival tissues or to study their cellular and subcellular localization in FFPE tissues have been lacking. Here we report the coordinated miRNA expression analysis from the tissue level to the subcellular level, using the RAKE (RNA-primed, array-based, Klenow Enzyme) miRNA microarray platform in conjunction with Locked Nucleic Acid (LNA)-based in situ hybridization (LNA-ISH) on archival FFPE human brains and oligodendroglial tumors. The ability to profile miRNAs from archival tissues at the tissue level, by RAKE microarrays, and at the cellular level by LNA-ISH, will accelerate studies of miRNAs in human diseases."

        "abstract": "A critical question about signal transduction is how weak or transient activation of signaling pathways achieves a robust and long-term switch in gene expression. We report that a microRNA is part of a mechanism that makes cells sensitive to signals in the Drosophila eye. Expression of miR-7 is activated in cells as they begin differentiating into photoreceptors. This is dependent on EGF receptor (EGFR) signaling that triggers ERK-mediated degradation of the transcription factor Yan. In nonstimulated cells, Yan represses miR-7 transcription, whereas miR-7 RNA represses Yan protein expression in photoreceptors, by binding to sequences within its mRNA 3'UTR. We propose that reciprocal negative feedback between Yan and miR-7 ensures mutually exclusive expression, with Yan in progenitor cells and miR-7 in photoreceptor cells. Expression is switched when EGFR signaling transiently triggers Yan degradation. This two-tiered mechanism explains how signal transduction activity can robustly generate a stable change in gene-expression patterns."

        "abstract": "In higher eukaryotes, miRNAs and siRNAs guide translational inhibition, mRNA cleavage, or chromatin regulation. We found that the antisense overlapping gene pair of Delta(1)-pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase (P5CDH), a stress-related gene, and SRO5, a gene of unknown function, generates two types of siRNAs. When both transcripts are present, a 24-nt siRNA is formed by a biogenesis pathway dependent on DCL2, RDR6, SGS3, and NRPD1A. Initial cleavage of the P5CDH transcript guided by the 24-nt siRNA establishes a phase for the subsequent generation of 21-nt siRNAs by DCL1 and further cleavage of P5CDH transcripts. The expression of SRO5 is induced by salt, and this induction is required to initiate siRNA formation. Our data suggest that the P5CDH and SRO5 proteins are also functionally related, and that the P5CDH-SRO5 gene pair defines a mode of siRNA function and biogenesis that may be applied to other natural cis-antisense gene pairs in eukaryotic genomes."

        "abstract": "Understanding the molecular mechanisms that regulate cellular proliferation and differentiation is a central theme of developmental biology. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of regulatory RNAs of approximately 22 nucleotides that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression. Increasing evidence points to the potential role of miRNAs in various biological processes. Here we show that miRNA-1 (miR-1) and miRNA-133 (miR-133), which are clustered on the same chromosomal loci, are transcribed together in a tissue-specific manner during development. miR-1 and miR-133 have distinct roles in modulating skeletal muscle proliferation and differentiation in cultured myoblasts in vitro and in Xenopus laevis embryos in vivo. miR-1 promotes myogenesis by targeting histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4), a transcriptional repressor of muscle gene expression. By contrast, miR-133 enhances myoblast proliferation by repressing serum response factor (SRF). Our results show that two mature miRNAs, derived from the same miRNA polycistron and transcribed together, can carry out distinct biological functions. Together, our studies suggest a molecular mechanism in which miRNAs participate in transcriptional circuits that control skeletal muscle gene expression and embryonic development."

        "title": "Regulation of phosphate homeostasis by MicroRNA in Arabidopsis.",
        "abstract": "In this study, we reveal a mechanism by which plants regulate inorganic phosphate (Pi) homeostasis to adapt to environmental changes in Pi availability. This mechanism involves the suppression of a ubiquitin-conjugating E2 enzyme by a specific microRNA, miR399. Upon Pi starvation, the miR399 is upregulated and its target gene, a ubiquitin-conjugating E2 enzyme, is downregulated in Arabidopsis thaliana. Accumulation of the E2 transcript is suppressed in transgenic Arabidopsis overexpressing miR399. Transgenic plants accumulated five to six times the normal Pi level in shoots and displayed Pi toxicity symptoms that were phenocopied by a loss-of-function E2 mutant. Pi toxicity was caused by increased Pi uptake and by translocation of Pi from roots to shoots and retention of Pi in the shoots. Moreover, unlike wild-type plants, in which Pi in old leaves was readily retranslocated to other developing young tissues, remobilization of Pi in miR399-overexpressing plants was impaired. These results provide evidence that miRNA controls Pi homeostasis by regulating the expression of a component of the proteolysis machinery in plants."

Recently it has been recognized that miRNAs comprise one of the abundant gene families in multicellular species, and their regulatory functions in various biological processes are widely spread. There has been a surge in the research activities in this field in the past few years. From the very beginning, computational methods have been utilized as indispensable tools, and many discoveries have been obtained through combination of experimental and computational approaches. In this review, both biological and computational aspects of miRNA will be discussed.

        "abstract": "Plant virus infection involves the production of viral small RNAs (vsRNAs) with the potential to associate with distinct Argonaute (AGO)-containing silencing complexes and mediate diverse silencing effects on RNA and chromatin. We used multiplexed, high-throughput pyrosequencing to profile populations of vsRNAs from plants infected with viruses from different genera. Sense and antisense vsRNAs of 20 to 24 nucleotides (nts) spread throughout the entire viral genomes in an overlapping configuration; virtually all genomic nucleotide positions were represented in the data set. We present evidence to suggest that every genomic position could be a putative cleavage site for vsRNA formation, although viral genomes contain specific regions that serve as preferential sources of vsRNA production. Hotspots for vsRNAs of 21-, 22-, and 24-nt usually coincide in the same genomic regions, indicating similar target affinities among Dicer-like (DCL) enzymes. In the light of our results, the overall contribution of perfectly base paired double-stranded RNA and imperfectly base paired structures within single-stranded RNA to vsRNA formation is discussed. Our census of vsRNAs extends the current view of the distribution and composition of vsRNAs in virus-infected plants, and contributes to a better understanding of vsRNA biogenesis."

        "abstract": "We predict regulatory targets of vertebrate microRNAs (miRNAs) by identifying mRNAs with conserved complementarity to the seed (nucleotides 2-7) of the miRNA. An overrepresentation of conserved adenosines flanking the seed complementary sites in mRNAs indicates that primary sequence determinants can supplement base pairing to specify miRNA target recognition. In a four-genome analysis of 3' UTRs, approximately 13,000 regulatory relationships were detected above the estimate of false-positive predictions, thereby implicating as miRNA targets more than 5300 human genes, which represented 30% of our gene set. Targeting was also detected in open reading frames. In sum, well over one third of human genes appear to be conserved miRNA targets."

        "abstract": "We sequenced 122 miRNAs in 10 primate species to reveal conservation characteristics of miRNA genes. Strong conservation is observed in stems of miRNA hairpins and increased variation in loop sequences. Interestingly, a striking drop in conservation was found for sequences immediately flanking the miRNA hairpins. This characteristic profile was employed to predict novel miRNAs using cross-species comparisons. Nine hundred and seventy-six candidate miRNAs were identified by scanning whole-genome human/mouse and human/rat alignments. Most of the novel candidates are conserved also in other vertebrates (dog, cow, chicken, opossum, zebrafish). Northern blot analysis confirmed the expression of mature miRNAs for 16 out of 69 representative candidates. Additional support for the expression of 179 novel candidates can be found in public databases, their presence in gene clusters, and literature that appeared after these predictions were made. Taken together, these results suggest the presence of significantly higher numbers of miRNAs in the human genome than previously estimated."

        "abstract": "RNA interference (RNAi) is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism for silencing gene expression. In primitive organisms, RNAi protects the genome from viruses and other insertable genetic elements and regulates gene expression during development. The antisense (guide) strand of short double-stranded RNAs is incorporated into an RNA-induced silencing complex that can either suppress protein expression or direct degradation of messenger RNAs that contain homologous sequence(s). The discovery that RNAi works in mammalian cells has sparked intense investigation into its role in normal mammalian cell function, its use as a tool to understand or screen for genes functioning in cellular pathways in healthy and diseased cells and animals, and its potential for therapeutic gene silencing. RNAi may provide an important new therapeutic modality for treating infection, cancer, neurodegenerative disease, and other illnesses, although in vivo delivery of small interfering RNAs into cells remains a significant obstacle."

        "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome is a common form of inherited mental retardation caused by the loss of FMR1 expression. The FMR1 gene encodes an RNA-binding protein that associates with translating ribosomes and acts as a negative translational regulator. In Drosophila, the fly homolog of the FMR1 protein (dFMR1) binds to and represses the translation of an mRNA encoding of the microtuble-associated protein Futsch. We have isolated a dFMR1-associated complex that includes two ribosomal proteins, L5 and L11, along with 5S RNA. The dFMR1 complex also contains Argonaute2 (AGO2) and a Drosophila homolog of p68 RNA helicase (Dmp68). AGO2 is an essential component for the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), a sequence-specific nuclease complex that mediates RNA interference (RNAi) in Drosophila. We show that Dmp68 is also required for efficient RNAi. We further show that dFMR1 is associated with Dicer, another essential component of the RNAi pathway, and microRNAs (miRNAs) in vivo, suggesting that dFMR1 is part of the RNAi-related apparatus. Our findings suggest a model in which the RNAi and dFMR1-mediated translational control pathways intersect in Drosophila. Our findings also raise the possibility that defects in an RNAi-related machinery may cause human disease."

They include microRNAs (miRNAs) and short-interfering RNAs (siRNAs), classes of approximately 22 nucleotide RNAs. miRNAs and siRNAs bind to Argonaute proteins and form effector complexes that regulate gene expression; in animals, this regulation occurs primarily at the post-transcriptional level. In this review, we will discuss our current understanding of how miRNA and siRNAs are generated and how they function to silence gene expression, focusing on animal and, in particular, mammalian miRNAs."

        "title": "MicroRNA involvement in brain tumors: from bench to bedside.",
        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a novel class of small non-coding RNAs, are effective post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression, exhibiting, when altered in human tumors, both oncogenic and tumor suppressive potential. Recently, miRNA involvement in the pathophysiology of brain cancer has been assessed. Aberrant gene expression is the main mechanism of miRNAs dysfunction in cancer, with abnormal expression levels of mature and/or precursor miRNA expression in tumor samples versus normal. MiRNA germline and somatic mutations or polymorphisms in the protein coding messenger RNA targeted by miRNAs may also occur, contributing to cancer predisposition, initiation and/or progression. If present in somatic cells, miRNA alterations may play a role in tumor initiation, while if present in germ line cells they could constitute a cancer predisposing event. MiRNA expression profiling of human tumors has led to the identification of signatures correlated with the tumor diagnosis, staging, progression, prognosis and response to treatment. MiRNA fingerprinting can therefore be added to the diagnostic and prognostic tools used by medical oncologists. Furthermore, new therapeutic strategies involving miRNA silencing or miRNA mimics could be proposed based on the roles of these small non-coding RNAs as oncogenes and tumor suppressors in brain tumors."

        "title": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) in neurodegenerative diseases.",
        "abstract": "Aging-related neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) are the culmination of many different genetic and environmental influences. Prior studies have shown that RNAs are pathologically altered during the inexorable course of some NDs. Recent evidence suggests that microRNAs (miRNAs) may be a contributing factor in neurodegeneration. miRNAs are brain-enriched, small ( approximately 22 nucleotides) non-coding RNAs that participate in mRNA translational regulation. Although discovered in the framework of worm development, miRNAs are now appreciated to play a dynamic role in many mammalian brain-related biochemical pathways, including neuroplasticity and stress responses. Research about miRNAs in the context of neurodegeneration is accumulating rapidly, and the goal of this review is to provide perspective for these new data that may be helpful to specialists in either field. An overview is provided about the normal functions for miRNAs, including some of the newer concepts related to the human brain. Recently published studies pertaining to the roles of miRNAs in NDs--including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and triplet repeat disorders-are described. Finally, a discussion is included with theoretical syntheses and possible future directions in exploring the nexus between miRNA and ND research."

        "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that microRNA (miRNA) regulates gene expression by repressing translation or directing sequence-specific degradation of complementary mRNA. Here, we report new evidence in which miRNA may also function to induce gene expression. By scanning gene promoters in silico for sequences complementary to known miRNAs, we identified a putative miR-373 target site in the promoter of E-cadherin. Transfection of miR-373 and its precursor hairpin RNA (pre-miR-373) into PC-3 cells readily induced E-cadherin expression. Knockdown experiments confirmed that induction of E-cadherin by pre-miR-373 required the miRNA maturation protein Dicer. Further analysis revealed that cold-shock domain-containing protein C2 (CSDC2), which possesses a putative miR-373 target site within its promoter, was also readily induced in response to miR-373 and pre-miR-373. Furthermore, enrichment of RNA polymerase II was detected at both E-cadherin and CSDC2 promoters after miR-373 transfection. Mismatch mutations to miR-373 indicated that gene induction was specific to the miR-373 sequence. Transfection of promoter-specific dsRNAs revealed that the concurrent induction of E-cadherin and CSDC2 by miR-373 required the miRNA target sites in both promoters. In conclusion, we have identified a miRNA that targets promoter sequences and induces gene expression. These findings reveal a new mode by which miRNAs may regulate gene expression."

Along with the many studies that delineated the proteins and substrates that form the RNAi pathway, this finding changed our understanding of the posttranscriptional regulation of mammalian gene expression. Furthermore, the development of methods that exploited the RNAi pathway began the technological revolution that eventually enabled the interrogation of mammalian gene function-from a single gene to the whole genome-in only a few days. The needs of the cancer research community have driven much of this progress. In this perspective, we highlight milestones in the development and application of RNAi-based methods to study carcinogenesis. We discuss how RNAi-based functional genetic analysis of exemplar tumor suppressors and oncogenes furthered our understanding of cancer initiation and progression and explore how such studies formed the basis of genome-wide scale efforts to identify cancer or cancer-type specific vulnerabilities, including studies conducted in vivo. Furthermore, we examine how RNAi technologies have revealed new cancer-relevant molecular targets and the implications for cancer of the first RNAi-based drugs. Finally, we discuss the future of functional genetic analysis, highlighting the increasing availability of complementary approaches to analyze cancer gene function."

Over 1,000 human miRNAs have been discovered to date; however, the biological function and protein targets for the majority remain to be uncovered. Within the respiratory system, miRNAs are important in normal pulmonary development and maintaining lung homeostasis. Recent studies have also begun to reveal that altered miRNA expression profiles may be associated with pathological processes within the lung and lead to the development of various pulmonary diseases, ranging from inflammatory diseases to lung cancers.

        "title": "TRBP recruits the Dicer complex to Ago2 for microRNA processing and gene silencing.",
        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are generated by a two-step processing pathway to yield RNA molecules of approximately 22 nucleotides that negatively regulate target gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Primary miRNAs are processed to precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) by the Microprocessor complex. These pre-miRNAs are cleaved by the RNase III Dicer to generate mature miRNAs that direct the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) to messenger RNAs with complementary sequence. Here we show that TRBP (the human immunodeficiency virus transactivating response RNA-binding protein), which contains three double-stranded, RNA-binding domains, is an integral component of a Dicer-containing complex. Biochemical analysis of TRBP-containing complexes revealed the association of Dicer-TRBP with Argonaute 2 (Ago2), the catalytic engine of RISC. The physical association of Dicer-TRBP and Ago2 was confirmed after the isolation of the ternary complex using Flag-tagged Ago2 cell lines. In vitro reconstitution assays demonstrated that TRBP is required for the recruitment of Ago2 to the small interfering RNA (siRNA) bound by Dicer. Knockdown of TRBP results in destabilization of Dicer and a consequent loss of miRNA biogenesis. Finally, depletion of the Dicer-TRBP complex via exogenously introduced siRNAs diminished RISC-mediated reporter gene silencing. These results support a role of the Dicer-TRBP complex not only in miRNA processing but also as a platform for RISC assembly."

        "abstract": "The vertebrate genome contains hundreds of small non-coding 'microRNAs' that have been implicated in controlling the expression of potentially thousands of target genes. Presently, only a handful of these targets have been characterized.

        "title": "A database analysis method identifies an endogenous trans-acting short-interfering RNA that targets the Arabidopsis ARF2, ARF3, and ARF4 genes.",
        "abstract": "Two classes of small RNAs, microRNAs and short-interfering RNA (siRNAs), have been extensively studied in plants and animals. In Arabidopsis, the capacity to uncover previously uncharacterized small RNAs by means of conventional strategies seems to be reaching its limits. To discover new plant small RNAs, we developed a protocol to mine an Arabidopsis nonannotated, noncoding EST database. Using this approach, we identified an endogenous small RNA, trans-acting short-interfering RNA-auxin response factor (tasiR-ARF), that shares a 21- and 22-nt region of sequence similarity with members of the ARF gene family. tasiR-ARF has characteristics of both short-interfering RNA and microRNA, recently defined as tasiRNA. Accumulation of trans-acting siRNA depends on DICER-LIKE1 and RNA-DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASE6 but not RNA-DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASE2. We demonstrate that tasiR-ARF targets three ARF genes, ARF2, ARF3/ETT, and ARF4, and that both the tasiR-ARF precursor and its target genes are evolutionarily conserved. The identification of tasiRNA-ARF as a low-abundance, previously uncharacterized small RNA species proves our method to be a useful tool to uncover additional small regulatory RNAs."

Here we identify a novel dsRNA-binding protein, which we named R3D1-L, that forms a stable complex with Dicer-1 in vitro and in vivo. While depletion of R3D1-L by RNAi causes accumulation of precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA) in S2 cells, recombinant R3D1-L enhances miRNA production by Dicer-1 in vitro. Furthermore, R3D1 deficiency causes miRNA-generating defect and severe sterility in male and female flies. Therefore, R3D1-L functions in concert with Dicer-1 in miRNA biogenesis and is required for reproductive development in Drosophila."

        "title": "Human microRNA prediction through a probabilistic co-learning model of sequence and structure.",
        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small regulatory RNAs of approximately 22 nt. Although hundreds of miRNAs have been identified through experimental complementary DNA cloning methods and computational efforts, previous approaches could detect only abundantly expressed miRNAs or close homologs of previously identified miRNAs. Here, we introduce a probabilistic co-learning model for miRNA gene finding, ProMiR, which simultaneously considers the structure and sequence of miRNA precursors (pre-miRNAs). On 5-fold cross-validation with 136 referenced human datasets, the efficiency of the classification shows 73% sensitivity and 96% specificity. When applied to genome screening for novel miRNAs on human chromosomes 16, 17, 18 and 19, ProMiR effectively searches distantly homologous patterns over diverse pre-miRNAs, detecting at least 23 novel miRNA gene candidates. Importantly, the miRNA gene candidates do not demonstrate clear sequence similarity to the known miRNA genes. By quantitative PCR followed by RNA interference against Drosha, we experimentally confirmed that 9 of the 23 representative candidate genes express transcripts that are processed by the miRNA biogenesis enzyme Drosha in HeLa cells, indicating that ProMiR may successfully predict miRNA genes with at least 40% accuracy. Our study suggests that the miRNA gene family may be more abundant than previously anticipated, and confer highly extensive regulatory networks on eukaryotic cells."

        "abstract": "Mouse microRNAs (miRNAs) miR-290-miR295 are encoded by a cluster of partially homologous pre-miRNA hairpins and are likely to be functionally important in embryonic stem (ES) cells and preimplantation embryos. We present evidence that a spliced, capped, and polyadenylated primary transcript spans this entire Early Embryonic microRNA Cluster (EEmiRC). Partial Drosha processing yields additional large nuclear RNA intermediates. A conserved promoter element containing a TATA-box directs EEmiRC transcription. Sequence analysis shows that the EEmiRC transcription unit is remarkably variable and can only be identified bioinformatically in placental (eutherian) mammals. Consistent with eutherian-specific function, EEmiRC is expressed in trophoblastic stem (TS) cells. When analyzing evolutionary and functional relationships, the organization of the entire miRNA loci should be considered in addition to the mature miRNA sequences. Application of this concept suggests that EEmiRC is a recently acquired rapidly evolving gene important for eutherian development."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs are small noncoding RNAs that control gene function posttranscriptionally through mRNA degradation or translational inhibition. Much has been learned about the processing and mechanism of action of microRNAs, but little is known about their biological function. Here, we demonstrate that injection of 2'O-methyl antisense oligoribonucleotides into early Drosophila embryos leads to specific and efficient depletion of microRNAs and thus permits systematic loss-of-function analysis in vivo. Twenty-five of the forty-six embryonically expressed microRNAs show readily discernible defects; pleiotropy is moderate and family members display similar yet distinct phenotypes. Processes under microRNA regulation include cellularization and patterning in the blastoderm, morphogenesis, and cell survival. The largest microRNA family in Drosophila (miR-2/6/11/13/308) is required for suppressing embryonic apoptosis; this is achieved by differential posttranscriptional repression of the proapoptotic factors hid, grim, reaper, and sickle. Our findings demonstrate that microRNAs act as specific and essential regulators in a wide range of developmental processes."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, noncoding RNAs that can play crucial regulatory roles in eukaryotes by targeting mRNAs for silencing. To test whether miRNAs play roles in the regulation of wood development in tree species, we isolated small RNAs from the developing xylem of Populus trichocarpa stems and cloned 22 miRNAs. They are the founding members of 21 miRNA gene families for 48 miRNA sequences, represented by 98 loci in the Populus genome. A majority of these miRNAs were predicted to target developmental- and stress/defense-related genes and possible functions associated with the biosynthesis of cell wall metabolites. Of the 21 P. trichocarpa miRNA families, 11 have sequence conservation in Arabidopsis thaliana but exhibited species-specific developmental expression patterns, suggesting that even conserved miRNAs may have different regulatory roles in different species. Most unexpectedly, the remaining 10 miRNAs, for which 17 predicted targets were experimentally validated in vivo, are absent from the Arabidopsis genome, suggesting possible roles in tree-specific processes. In fact, the expression of a majority of the cloned miRNAs was upregulated or downregulated in woody stems in a manner consistent with tree-specific corrective growth against tension and compression stresses, two constant mechanical loads in trees. Our results show that plant miRNAs can be induced by mechanical stress and may function in one of the most critical defense systems for structural and mechanical fitness."

We have investigated the mechanism of lin-4 RNA action by examining the fate of lin-14 mRNA in vivo during the time that lin-4 RNA is expressed. Our results indicate that the rate of synthesis of lin-14 mRNA, its state of polyadenylation, its abundance in the cytoplasmic fraction, and its polysomal sedimentation profile do not change in response to the accumulation of lin-4 RNA. Our results indicate that association of lin-4 RNA with the 3' UTR of lin-14 mRNA permits normal biogenesis of lin-14 mRNA, and normal translational initiation, but inhibits step(s) thereafter, such as translational elongation and/or the release of stable LIN-14 protein."

Although the oncogenic and tumour-suppressive functions of several miRNAs have been characterized, the role of miRNAs in mediating tumour metastasis was addressed only recently and still remains largely unexplored. To identify potential metastasis-promoting miRNAs, we set up a genetic screen using a non-metastatic, human breast tumour cell line that was transduced with a miRNA-expression library and subjected to a trans-well migration assay. We found that human miR-373 and miR-520c stimulated cancer cell migration and invasion in vitro and in vivo, and that certain cancer cell lines depend on endogenous miR-373 activity to migrate efficiently. Mechanistically, the migration phenotype of miR-373 and miR-520c can be explained by suppression of CD44. We found significant upregulation of miR-373 in clinical breast cancer metastasis samples that correlated inversely with CD44 expression. Taken together, our findings indicate that miRNAs are involved in tumour migration and invasion, and implicate miR-373 and miR-520c as metastasis-promoting miRNAs."

MiRNAs function at all stages of neuronal development, ranging from the initial specification of neuronal cell types to the formation and plasticity of synaptic connections between individual neurons. Moreover, links between miRNA dysfunction and neurological diseases become more and more apparent. The study of this novel layer of gene regulation therefore promises to enrich our knowledge of brain function and pathology."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs constitute a large family of small, approximately 21-nucleotide-long, non-coding RNAs that have emerged as key post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression in metazoans and plants. In mammals, microRNAs are predicted to control the activity of approximately 30% of all protein-coding genes, and have been shown to participate in the regulation of almost every cellular process investigated so far. By base pairing to mRNAs, microRNAs mediate translational repression or mRNA degradation. This Review summarizes the current understanding of the mechanistic aspects of microRNA-induced repression of translation and discusses some of the controversies regarding different modes of microRNA function."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short regulatory RNAs that direct repression of their mRNA targets. The miRNA \"seed\"-nucleotides 2-7-establishes target specificity by mediating target binding. Accurate processing of the miRNA 5' end is thought to be under strong selective pressure because a shift by just one nucleotide in the 5' end of a miRNA alters its seed sequence, redefining its repertoire of targets (Figure 1). Animal miRNAs are produced by the sequential cleavage of partially double-stranded precursors by the RNase III endonucleases Drosha and Dicer, thereby generating a transitory double-stranded intermediate comprising the miRNA paired to its partially complementary miRNA* strand. Here, we report that in flies, the 5' ends of miRNAs and miRNA* strands are typically more precisely defined than their 3' ends. Surprisingly, the precision of the 5' ends of both miRNA and miRNA* sequences increases after Argonaute2 (Ago2) loading. Our data imply that either many miRNA* sequences are under evolutionary pressure to maintain their seed sequences-that is, they have targets-or that secondary constraints, such as the sequence requirements for loading small RNAs into functional Argonaute complexes, narrow the range of miRNA and miRNA 5' ends that accumulate in flies."

As RNA-based therapeutics come of age, understanding the miRNA pathway and the mechanism of posttranscriptional gene silencing is paramount.

To date, more than 600 human miRNAs have been experimentally identified, and estimated to regulate more than one third of cellular messenger RNAs. Accumulating evidence has linked the dysregulated expression patterns of miRNAs to a variety of diseases, such as cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular diseases and viral infections. MiRNAs provide its particular layer of network for gene regulation, thus possessing the great potential both as a novel class of therapeutic targets and as a powerful intervention tool. In this regard, synthetic RNAs that contain the binding sites of miRNA have been shown to work as a \"decoy\" or \"miRNA sponge\" to inhibit the function of specific miRNAs. On the other hand, miRNA expression vectors have been used to restore or overexpress specific miRNAs to achieve a long-term effect. Further, double-stranded miRNA mimetics for transient replacement have been experimentally validated. Endogenous precursor miRNAs have also been used as scaffolds for the induction of RNA interference. This article reviews the recent progress on this emerging technology as a powerful tool for gene regulation studies and particularly as a rationale strategy for design of therapeutics."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) were first discovered in genetic screens for regulators of developmental timing in the stem-cell-like seam cell lineage in Caenorhabditis elegans. As members of the heterochronic pathway, the lin-4 and let-7 miRNAs are required in the seam cells for the correct progression of stage-specific events and to ensure that cell cycle exit and terminal differentiation occur at the correct time. Other heterochronic genes such as lin-28 and lin-41 are direct targets of the lin-4 and let-7 miRNAs. Recent findings on the functions of the let-7 and lin-4/mir-125 miRNA families and lin-28 and lin-41 orthologs from a variety of organisms suggest that core elements of the heterochronic pathway are retained in mammalian stem cells and development. In particular, these genes appear to form bistable switches via double-negative feedback loops in both nematode and mammalian stem cell development, the functional relevance of which is finally becoming clear. let-7 inhibits stem cell self-renewal in both normal and cancer stem cells of the breast and acts as a tumor suppressor in lung and breast cancer. let-7 also promotes terminal differentiation at the larval to adult transition in both nematode stem cells and fly wing imaginal discs and inhibits proliferation of human lung and liver cancer cells. Conversely, LIN-28 is a highly specific embryonic stem cell marker and is one of four \"stemness\" factors used to reprogram adult fibroblasts into induced pluripotent stem cells; furthermore, lin-28 is oncogenic in hepatocellular carcinomas. Therefore, a core module of heterochronic genes--lin-28, lin-41, let-7, and lin-4/mir-125-acts as an ancient regulatory switch for differentiation in stem cells (and in some cancers), illustrating that nematode seam cells mirror miRNA regulatory networks in mammalian stem cells during both normal development and cancer."

MiRNAs function as oncogenes or tumor suppressors during tumor development and progression. Experimental evidence demonstrates that correction of specific miRNA alterations using miRNA mimics or antagomirs can normalize the gene regulatory network and signaling pathways, and reverse the phenotype in cancerous cells. MiRNA-based gene therapy provides an attractive anti-tumor approach for integrated cancer therapy.

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a conserved class of small non-coding RNAs that assemble with Argonaute proteins into miRNA-induced silencing complexes (miRISCs) to direct post-transcriptional silencing of complementary mRNA targets. Silencing is accomplished through a combination of translational repression and mRNA destabilization, with the latter contributing to most of the steady-state repression in animal cell cultures. Degradation of the mRNA target is initiated by deadenylation, which is followed by decapping and 5'-to-3' exonucleolytic decay. Recent work has enhanced our understanding of the mechanisms of silencing, making it possible to describe in molecular terms a continuum of direct interactions from miRNA target recognition to mRNA deadenylation, decapping and 5'-to-3' degradation. Furthermore, an intricate interplay between translational repression and mRNA degradation is emerging."

        "abstract": "SPL3, SPL4 and SPL5 (SPL3/4/5) are closely related members of the SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE family of transcription factors in Arabidopsis, and have a target site for the microRNA miR156 in their 3' UTR. The phenotype of Arabidopsis plants constitutively expressing miR156-sensitive and miR156-insensitive forms of SPL3/4/5 revealed that all three genes promote vegetative phase change and flowering, and are strongly repressed by miR156. Constitutive expression of miR156a prolonged the expression of juvenile vegetative traits and delayed flowering. This phenotype was largely corrected by constitutive expression of a miR156-insensitive form of SPL3. The juvenile-to-adult transition is accompanied by a decrease in the level of miR156 and an increase in the abundance of SPL3 mRNA. The complementary effect of hasty on the miR156 and SPL3 transcripts, as well as the miR156-dependent temporal expression pattern of a 35S::GUS-SPL3 transgene, suggest that the decrease in miR156 is responsible for the increase in SPL3 expression during this transition. SPL3 mRNA is elevated by mutations in ZIPPY/AGO7, RNA DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASE 6 (RDR6) and SUPPRESSOR OF GENE SILENCING 3 (SGS3), indicating that it is directly or indirectly regulated by RNAi. However, our results indicate that RNAi does not contribute to the temporal expression pattern of this gene. We conclude that vegetative phase change in Arabidopsis is regulated by an increase in the expression of SPL3 and probably also SPL4 and SPL5, and that this increase is a consequence of a decrease in the level of miR156."

        "abstract": "We use Caenorhabditis elegans to test proposed general rules for microRNA (miRNA)-target interactions. We show that G.U base pairing is tolerated in the 'seed' region of the lsy-6 miRNA interaction with its in vivo target cog-1, and that 6- to 8-base-pair perfect seed pairing is not a generally reliable predictor for an interaction of lsy-6 with a 3' untranslated region (UTR). Rather, lsy-6 can functionally interact with its target site only in specific 3' UTR contexts. Our findings illustrate the difficulty of establishing generalizable rules of miRNA-target interactions."

        "abstract": "Three muscle-specific microRNAs, miR-206, -1, and -133, are induced during differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts in vitro. Transfection of miR-206 promotes differentiation despite the presence of serum, whereas inhibition of the microRNA by antisense oligonucleotide inhibits cell cycle withdrawal and differentiation, which are normally induced by serum deprivation. Among the many mRNAs that are down-regulated by miR-206, the p180 subunit of DNA polymerase alpha and three other genes are shown to be direct targets. Down-regulation of the polymerase inhibits DNA synthesis, an important component of the differentiation program. The direct targets are decreased by mRNA cleavage that is dependent on predicted microRNA target sites. Unlike small interfering RNA-directed cleavage, however, the 5' ends of the cleavage fragments are distributed and not confined to the target sites, suggesting involvement of exonucleases in the degradation process. In addition, inhibitors of myogenic transcription factors, Id1-3 and MyoR, are decreased upon miR-206 introduction, suggesting the presence of additional mechanisms by which microRNAs enforce the differentiation program."

        "abstract": "microRNAs (miRNAs) play a central role in the regulation of gene expression by targeting specific mRNAs for degradation or translational repression. Each miRNA is post-transcriptionally processed into a duplex comprising two strands. One of the two miRNA strands is selectively loaded into an Argonaute protein to form the miRNA-Induced Silencing Complex (miRISC) in a process referred to as miRNA strand selection. The other strand is ejected from the complex and is subject to degradation. The target gene specificity of miRISC is determined by sequence complementarity between the Argonaute-loaded miRNA strand and target mRNA. Each strand of the miRNA duplex has the capacity to be loaded into miRISC and possesses a unique seed sequence. Therefore, miRNA strand selection plays a defining role in dictating the specificity of miRISC toward its targets and provides a mechanism to alter gene expression in a switch-like fashion. Aberrant strand selection can lead to altered gene regulation by miRISC and is observed in several human diseases including cancer. Previous and emerging data shape the rules governing miRNA strand selection and shed light on how these rules can be circumvented in various physiological and pathological contexts.

        "title": "Mechanisms of miRNA-Mediated Gene Regulation from Common Downregulation to mRNA-Specific Upregulation.",
        "abstract": "Discovered in 1993, micoRNAs (miRNAs) are now recognized as one of the major regulatory gene families in eukaryotes. To date, 24521 microRNAs have been discovered and there are certainly more to come. It was primarily acknowledged that miRNAs result in gene expression repression at both the level of mRNA stability by conducting mRNA degradation and the level of translation (at initiation and after initiation) by inhibiting protein translation or degrading the polypeptides through binding complementarily to 3'UTR of the target mRNAs. Nevertheless, some studies revealed that miRNAs have the capability of activating gene expression directly or indirectly in respond to different cell types and conditions and in the presence of distinct cofactors. This reversibility in their posttranslational gene regulatory natures enables the bearing cells to rapidly response to different cell conditions and consequently block unnecessary energy wastage or maintain the cell state. This paper provides an overview of the current understandings of the miRNA characteristics including their genes and biogenesis, as well as their mediated downregulation. We also review up-to-date knowledge of miRNA-mediated gene upregulation through highlighting some notable examples and discuss the emerging concepts of their associations with other posttranscriptional gene regulation processes."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs are one class of small, endogenous, non-coding RNAs that are approximately 22 nucleotides in length; they are very numerous, have been phylogenetically conserved, and involved in biological processes such as development, differentiation, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. MicroRNAs contribute to modulating the expression levels of specific proteins based on sequence complementarity with their target mRNA molecules and so they play a key role in both health and disease. Angiogenesis is the process of new blood vessel formation from preexisting ones, which is particularly relevant to cancer and its progression. Over the last few years, microRNAs have emerged as critical regulators of signalling pathways in multiple cell types including endothelial and perivascular cells. This review summarises the role of miRNAs in tumour angiogenesis and their potential implications as therapeutic targets in cancer."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that direct posttranscriptional regulation of specific target genes. Since their discovery in Caenorhabditis elegans, they have been associated with the control of virtually all biological processes and are known to play major roles in development and cellular homeostasis. Yet the biological roles of most miRNAs remain to be fully known. Furthermore, the precise rules by which miRNAs recognize their targets and mediate gene silencing are still unclear. Systematic identification of miRNAs and of the RNAs they regulate is essential to close these knowledge gaps. Studies in C. elegans have been instrumental not only in the discovery phase of miRNA biology but also in the elucidation of mechanisms regulating miRNA expression, target recognition and regulation. This chapter highlights some of the main challenges still present in the field, while introducing the major studies and methods used to find miRNAs and their targets in the worm."

        "title": "Emerging roles of microRNAs as molecular switches in the integrated circuit of the cancer cell.",
        "abstract": "Transformation of normal cells into malignant tumors requires the acquisition of six hallmark traits, e.g., self-sufficiency in growth signals, insensitivity to antigrowth signals and self-renewal, evasion of apoptosis, limitless replication potential, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis, which are common to all cancers (Hanahan and Weinberg 2000). These new cellular traits evolve from defects in major regulatory microcircuits that are fundamental for normal homeostasis. The discovery of microRNAs (miRNAs) as a new class of small non-protein-coding RNAs that control gene expression post-transcriptionally by binding to various mRNA targets suggests that these tiny RNA molecules likely act as molecular switches in the extensive regulatory web that involves thousands of transcripts. Most importantly, accumulating evidence suggests that numerous microRNAs are aberrantly expressed in human cancers. In this review, we discuss the emergent roles of microRNAs as switches that function to turn on/off known cellular microcircuits. We outline recent compelling evidence that deregulated microRNA-mediated control of cellular microcircuits cooperates with other well-established regulatory mechanisms to confer the hallmark traits of the cancer cell. Furthermore, these exciting insights into aberrant microRNA control in cancer-associated circuits may be exploited for cancer therapies that will target deregulated miRNA switches."

        "title": "A viral suppressor of RNA silencing differentially regulates the accumulation of short interfering RNAs and micro-RNAs in tobacco.",
        "abstract": "Two major classes of small noncoding RNAs have emerged as important regulators of gene expression in eukaryotes, the short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) associated with RNA silencing and endogenous micro-RNAs (miRNAs) implicated in regulation of gene expression. Helper component-proteinase (HC-Pro) is a viral protein that blocks RNA silencing in plants. Here we examine the effect of HC-Pro on the accumulation of siRNAs and endogenous miRNAs. siRNAs were analyzed in transgenic tobacco plants silenced in response to three different classes of transgenes: sense-transgenes, inverted-repeat transgenes, and amplicon-transgenes. HC-Pro suppressed silencing in each line, blocking accumulation of the associated siRNAs and allowing accumulation of transcripts from the previously silenced loci. HC-Pro-suppression of silencing in the inverted-repeat- and amplicon-transgenic lines was accompanied by the apparent accumulation of long double-stranded RNAs and proportional amounts of small RNAs that are larger than the siRNAs that accumulate during silencing. Analysis of these results suggests that HC-Pro interferes with silencing either by inhibiting siRNA processing from double-stranded RNA precursors or by destabilizing siRNAs. In contrast to siRNAs, the accumulation of endogenous miRNAs was greatly enhanced in all of the HC-Pro-expressing lines. Thus, our results demonstrate that accumulation of siRNAs and miRNAs in plants can be differentially regulated by a viral protein. The fact that HC-Pro affects the miRNA pathway raises the possibility that this pathway is targeted by plant viruses as a means to control gene expression in the host."

        "abstract": "In Drosophila, two features of small interfering RNA (siRNA) structure--5' phosphates and 3' hydroxyls--are reported to be essential for RNA interference (RNAi). Here, we show that as in Drosophila, a 5' phosphate is required for siRNA function in human HeLa cells. In contrast, we find no evidence in flies or humans for a role in RNAi for the siRNA 3' hydroxyl group. Our in vitro data suggest that in both flies and mammals, each siRNA guides endonucleolytic cleavage of the target RNA at a single site. We conclude that the underlying mechanism of RNAi is conserved between flies and mammals and that RNA-dependent RNA polymerases are not required for RNAi in these organisms."

        "abstract": "We investigated the mechanism of RNA interference (RNAi) in human cells. Here we demonstrate that the status of the 5' hydroxyl terminus of the antisense strand of a siRNA determines RNAi activity, while a 3' terminus block is tolerated in vivo. 5' hydroxyl termini of antisense strands isolated from human cells were phosphorylated, and 3' end biotin groups were not efficiently removed. We found no requirement for a perfect A-form helix in siRNA for interference effects, but an A-form structure was required for antisense-target RNA duplexes. Strikingly, crosslinking of the siRNA duplex by psoralen did not completely block RNA interference, indicating that complete unwinding of the siRNA helix is not necessary for RNAi activity in vivo. These results suggest that RNA amplification by RNA-dependent RNA polymerase is not essential for RNAi in human cells."

        "title": "Human Dicer preferentially cleaves dsRNAs at their termini without a requirement for ATP.",
        "abstract": "Dicer is a multi-domain RNase III-related endonuclease responsible for processing double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) to small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) during a process of RNA interference (RNAi). It also catalyses excision of the regulatory microRNAs from their precursors. In this work, we describe the purification and properties of a recombinant human Dicer. The protein cleaves dsRNAs into approximately 22 nucleotide siRNAs. Accumulation of processing intermediates of discrete sizes, and experiments performed with substrates containing modified ends, indicate that Dicer preferentially cleaves dsRNAs at their termini. Binding of the enzyme to the substrate can be uncoupled from the cleavage step by omitting Mg(2+) or performing the reaction at 4 degrees C. Activity of the recombinant Dicer, and of the endogenous protein present in mammalian cell extracts, is stimulated by limited proteolysis, and the proteolysed enzyme becomes active at 4 degrees C. Cleavage of dsRNA by purifed Dicer and the endogenous enzyme is ATP independent. Additional experiments suggest that if ATP participates in the Dicer reaction in mammalian cells, it might be involved in product release needed for the multiple turnover of the enzyme."

        "abstract": "RNA silencing phenomena, known as post-transcriptional gene silencing in plants, quelling in fungi, and RNA interference (RNAi) in animals, are mediated by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and mechanistically intersect at the ribonuclease Dicer. Here, we report cloning and expression of the 218 kDa human Dicer, and characterization of its ribonuclease activity and dsRNA-binding properties. The recombinant enzyme generated approximately 21-23 nucleotide products from dsRNA. Processing of the microRNA let-7 precursor by Dicer produced an apparently mature let-7 RNA. Mg(2+) was required for dsRNase activity, but not for dsRNA binding, thereby uncoupling these reaction steps. ATP was dispensable for dsRNase activity in vitro. The Dicer.dsRNA complex formed at high KCl concentrations was catalytically inactive, suggesting that ionic interactions are involved in dsRNA cleavage. The putative dsRNA-binding domain located at the C-terminus of Dicer was demonstrated to bind dsRNA in vitro. Human Dicer expressed in mammalian cells colocalized with calreticulin, a resident protein of the endoplasmic reticulum. Availability of the recombinant Dicer protein will help improve our understanding of RNA silencing and other Dicer-related processes."

The underlying mechanisms in distinct gene silencing phenomena in different genetic systems, such as cosuppression in plants and RNAi in animals, are very similar. There are common RNA intermediates, and similar genes are required in RNA silencing pathways in protozoa, plants, fungi, and animals, thus indicating an ancient pathway. This chapter gives an overview of both biochemical and genetic approaches leading to the current understanding of the molecular mechanism of RNA silencing and its probable biological function."

        "title": "Mammalian microRNAs: experimental evaluation of novel and previously annotated genes.",
        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small regulatory RNAs that derive from distinctive hairpin transcripts. To learn more about the miRNAs of mammals, we sequenced 60 million small RNAs from mouse brain, ovary, testes, embryonic stem cells, three embryonic stages, and whole newborns. Analysis of these sequences confirmed 398 annotated miRNA genes and identified 108 novel miRNA genes. More than 150 previously annotated miRNAs and hundreds of candidates failed to yield sequenced RNAs with miRNA-like features. Ectopically expressing these previously proposed miRNA hairpins also did not yield small RNAs, whereas ectopically expressing the confirmed and newly identified hairpins usually did yield small RNAs with the classical miRNA features, including dependence on the Drosha endonuclease for processing. These experiments, which suggest that previous estimates of conserved mammalian miRNAs were inflated, provide a substantially revised list of confidently identified murine miRNAs from which to infer the general features of mammalian miRNAs. Our analyses also revealed new aspects of miRNA biogenesis and modification, including tissue-specific strand preferences, sequential Dicer cleavage of a metazoan precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA), consequential 5' heterogeneity, newly identified instances of miRNA editing, and evidence for widespread pre-miRNA uridylation reminiscent of miRNA regulation by Lin28."

        "abstract": "microRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNAs 18 to 24 nucleotides in length that serve the pivotal function of regulating gene expression. Instead of being translated into proteins, the mature single-stranded miRNA binds to messenger RNAs (mRNAs) to interfere with the translational process. It is estimated that whereas only 1% of the genomic transcripts in mammalian cells encode miRNA, nearly one-third of the encoded genes are regulated by miRNA. Various bioinformatics databases, tools, and algorithms have been developed to predict the sequences of miRNAs and their target genes. In combination with the in silico approaches in systems biology, experimental studies on miRNA provide a new bioengineering approach for understanding the mechanism of fine-tuning gene regulation. This review aims to provide state-of-the-art information on this important mechanism of gene regulation for researchers working in biomedical engineering and related fields. Particular emphases are placed on summarizing the current tools and strategies for miRNA study from a bioengineering perspective and the possible applications of miRNAs (such as antagomirs and miRNA sponges) in biomedical engineering research."

Recent knowledge suggests that the same protein families which mediate the experimental RNA interference (RNAi) in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster cells also contribute to the antiviral host defence in both invertebrate model organisms and mammals. Additionally, another branch of RNA silencing, the microRNAs (miRNAs), has been recently described in the context of host defence. In several studies, miRNAs have been shown to regulate essential immune responses. This review summarizes basic concepts of RNAi and miRNAs, especially in the context of immune defence, focusing on the newly discovered role of DEAD-box helicases in the RNA interference and antiviral host defence."

Maturation of miRNAs comprises several regulated steps resulting in approximately 22-nucleotide single-stranded mature miRNAs. Regulation of miRNA expression can occur both at the transcriptional level and at the post-transcriptional level during miRNA processing. Recent studies have elucidated specific aspects of the well-regulated nature of miRNA processing involving various regulatory proteins, editing of miRNA transcripts, and cellular location. In addition, single nucleotide polymorphisms in miRNA genes can also affect the processing efficiency of primary miRNA transcripts. In this review we present an overview of the currently known regulatory pathways of miRNA processing and provide a basis to understand how aberrant miRNA processing may arise and may be involved in pathophysiological conditions such as cancer."

        "abstract": "The nucleolytic activity of animal Argonaute proteins is deeply conserved, despite its having no obvious role in microRNA-directed gene regulation. In mice, Ago2 (also known as Eif2c2) is uniquely required for viability, and only this family member retains catalytic competence. To investigate the evolutionary pressure to conserve Argonaute enzymatic activity, we engineered a mouse with catalytically inactive Ago2 alleles. Homozygous mutants died shortly after birth with an obvious anaemia. Examination of microRNAs and their potential targets revealed a loss of miR-451, a small RNA important for erythropoiesis. Though this microRNA is processed by Drosha (also known as Rnasen), its maturation does not require Dicer. Instead, the pre-miRNA becomes loaded into Ago and is cleaved by the Ago catalytic centre to generate an intermediate 3' end, which is then further trimmed. Our findings link the conservation of Argonaute catalysis to a conserved mechanism of microRNA biogenesis that is important for vertebrate development."

        "title": "The biosynthetic pathways and biological scopes of plant small RNAs.",
        "abstract": "RNA silencing plays a crucial role in coordinating the expression, stability, protection and inheritance of eukaryotic genomes. It comprises several mechanisms that invariably depend on core small RNA molecules (sRNAs) and that achieve dedicated sequence-specific functions. Biogenesis and function of sRNAs generally follow a framework that involves main protein families conserved among eukaryotes. The most recent studies have provided structural insights into the function of RNA silencing components, identified novel players of these pathways and highlighted possible emerging classes of sRNA regulators. In this review, we integrate these studies to provide updated views on the biosynthetic pathways and dedicated functions of the endogenous sRNA classes of plants, emphasizing their specialized scopes."

        "title": "MicroRNA signatures in neurological disorders.",
        "abstract": "A class of small, non-coding transcripts called microRNAs (miRNAs) that play a major role in post-transcriptional gene regulation has recently emerged and become the focus of intense research. MicroRNAs are abundant in the nervous system, where they have key roles in development and are likely to be important mediators of plasticity. A highly conserved pathway of miRNA biogenesis is closely linked to the transport and translatability of mRNAs in neurons. MicroRNAs have been shown to modulate programmed cell death during development. Although there are nearly 750 known human miRNA sequences, each of only approximately 20-25 nucleotides in length that bind to multiple mRNA targets, the accurate prediction of miRNA targets seems to lie just beyond our grasp. Nevertheless, the identification of such targets promises to provide new insights into many facets of neuronal function. In this review, we briefly describe miRNA biogenesis and the principle approaches for studying the function of miRNAs and potential application of miRNAs as biomarkers, diagnostic targets, and potential therapeutic tools of human diseases in general and neurological disorders in particular."

        "abstract": "To date, more than 200 microRNAs have been described in humans; however, the precise functions of these regulatory, non-coding RNAs remains largely obscure. One cluster of microRNAs, the mir-17-92 polycistron, is located in a region of DNA that is amplified in human B-cell lymphomas. Here we compared B-cell lymphoma samples and cell lines to normal tissues, and found that the levels of the primary or mature microRNAs derived from the mir-17-92 locus are often substantially increased in these cancers. Enforced expression of the mir-17-92 cluster acted with c-myc expression to accelerate tumour development in a mouse B-cell lymphoma model. Tumours derived from haematopoietic stem cells expressing a subset of the mir-17-92 cluster and c-myc could be distinguished by an absence of apoptosis that was otherwise prevalent in c-myc-induced lymphomas. Together, these studies indicate that non-coding RNAs, specifically microRNAs, can modulate tumour formation, and implicate the mir-17-92 cluster as a potential human oncogene."

        "abstract": "Recent work has revealed the existence of a class of small non-coding RNA species, known as microRNAs (miRNAs), which have critical functions across various biological processes. Here we use a new, bead-based flow cytometric miRNA expression profiling method to present a systematic expression analysis of 217 mammalian miRNAs from 334 samples, including multiple human cancers. The miRNA profiles are surprisingly informative, reflecting the developmental lineage and differentiation state of the tumours. We observe a general downregulation of miRNAs in tumours compared with normal tissues. Furthermore, we were able to successfully classify poorly differentiated tumours using miRNA expression profiles, whereas messenger RNA profiles were highly inaccurate when applied to the same samples. These findings highlight the potential of miRNA profiling in cancer diagnosis."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are 21-23 nucleotide RNA molecules that regulate the stability or translational efficiency of target messenger RNAs. miRNAs have diverse functions, including the regulation of cellular differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis. Although strict tissue- and developmental-stage-specific expression is critical for appropriate miRNA function, mammalian transcription factors that regulate miRNAs have not yet been identified. The proto-oncogene c-MYC encodes a transcription factor that regulates cell proliferation, growth and apoptosis. Dysregulated expression or function of c-Myc is one of the most common abnormalities in human malignancy. Here we show that c-Myc activates expression of a cluster of six miRNAs on human chromosome 13. Chromatin immunoprecipation experiments show that c-Myc binds directly to this locus. The transcription factor E2F1 is an additional target of c-Myc that promotes cell cycle progression. We find that expression of E2F1 is negatively regulated by two miRNAs in this cluster, miR-17-5p and miR-20a. These findings expand the known classes of transcripts within the c-Myc target gene network, and reveal a mechanism through which c-Myc simultaneously activates E2F1 transcription and limits its translation, allowing a tightly controlled proliferative signal."

        "abstract": "One of the key characteristics of stem cells is their capacity to divide for long periods of time in an environment where most of the cells are quiescent. Therefore, a critical question in stem cell biology is how stem cells escape cell division stop signals. Here, we report the necessity of the microRNA (miRNA) pathway for proper control of germline stem cell (GSC) division in Drosophila melanogaster. Analysis of GSCs mutant for dicer-1 (dcr-1), the double-stranded RNaseIII essential for miRNA biogenesis, revealed a marked reduction in the rate of germline cyst production. These dcr-1 mutant GSCs exhibit normal identity but are defective in cell cycle control. On the basis of cell cycle markers and genetic interactions, we conclude that dcr-1 mutant GSCs are delayed in the G1 to S transition, which is dependent on the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Dacapo, suggesting that miRNAs are required for stem cells to bypass the normal G1/S checkpoint. Hence, the miRNA pathway might be part of a mechanism that makes stem cells insensitive to environmental signals that normally stop the cell cycle at the G1/S transition."

MicroRNAs are phylogenetically conserved small RNAs that regulate the translation of target messenger RNAs, providing a mechanism for protein dose regulation. Here we show that microRNA-1-1 (miR-1-1) and miR-1-2 are specifically expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscle precursor cells. We found that the miR-1 genes are direct transcriptional targets of muscle differentiation regulators including serum response factor, MyoD and Mef2. Correspondingly, excess miR-1 in the developing heart leads to a decreased pool of proliferating ventricular cardiomyocytes. Using a new algorithm for microRNA target identification that incorporates features of RNA structure and target accessibility, we show that Hand2, a transcription factor that promotes ventricular cardiomyocyte expansion, is a target of miR-1. This work suggests that miR-1 genes titrate the effects of critical cardiac regulatory proteins to control the balance between differentiation and proliferation during cardiogenesis."

To date, 222 human microRNAs have been identified, 86 by random cloning and sequencing, 43 by computational approaches and the rest as putative microRNAs homologous to microRNAs in other species. To prove our hypothesis that the total number of microRNAs may be much larger and that several have emerged only in primates, we developed an integrative approach combining bioinformatic predictions with microarray analysis and sequence-directed cloning. Here we report the use of this approach to clone and sequence 89 new human microRNAs (nearly doubling the current number of sequenced human microRNAs), 53 of which are not conserved beyond primates. These findings suggest that the total number of human microRNAs is at least 800."

        "title": "Computational identification of novel microRNAs and targets in Brassica napus.",
        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a newly discovered class of non-protein-coding small RNAs with roughly 22 nucleotide-long. Increasing evidence has shown that miRNAs play multiple roles in biological processes, including development, cell proliferation and apoptosis and stress responses. In this research, several approaches were combined to make computational prediction of potential miRNAs and their targets in Brassica napus. We used previously known miRNAs from Arabidopsis, rice and other plant species against both expressed sequence tags (EST) and genomic survey sequence (GSS) databases to search for potential miRNAs in B. napus. A total of 21 potential miRNAs were detected following a range of strict filtering criteria. Using these potential miRNA sequences, we could further blast the mRNA database and found 67 potential targets in this species. According to the mRNA target information provided by NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), most of the target mRNAs appeared to be involved in plant growth, development and stress responses. To validate the prediction of miRNAs in B. napus, we performed a RT-PCR based assay of mature miRNA expression. Five miRNAs were identified in response to auxin, cadmium stress and phosphate starvation. So far, little is known about experimental or computational identification of miRNA in B. napus species. To improve efficiency for blast search, we developed an implementation (miRNAassist) that can identify homologs of miRNAs and their targets, with high sensitivity and specificity. The program is allowed to be run on Windows Operation System platform. miRNAassist is freely available if required."

        "title": "Mechanisms of microRNA-mediated gene regulation in animal cells.",
        "abstract": "MicroRNAs are a large family of regulatory molecules found in all multicellular organisms. Even though their functions are only beginning to be understood, it is evident that microRNAs have important roles in a wide range of biological processes, including developmental timing, growth control, and differentiation. Indeed, recent bioinformatic and experimental evidence suggests that a remarkably large proportion of genes (>30%) are subject to microRNA-mediated regulation. Although it is clear that microRNAs function by suppressing protein production from targeted mRNAs, there is, at present, no consensus about how such downregulation is accomplished. In this review, I describe the evidence that there are multiple mechanisms of microRNA-mediated repression and discuss the possible connections between these mechanisms."

        "title": "Arabidopsis primary microRNA processing proteins HYL1 and DCL1 define a nuclear body distinct from the Cajal body.",
        "abstract": "Small regulatory microRNAs (miRNAs) are encoded in long precursors and are released from them during processing by cleavage within partially duplexed stem-loop structures. In the present work we investigated the role of the Arabidopsis nuclear RNA-binding protein HYL1 and the nuclear RNase III enzyme DCL1 in processing of primary miRNA (pri-miR171a). The miR171a gene is complex, with multiple transcription start sites, as well as alternative splicing of exons and alternative polyadenylation sites. Both HYL1 and DCL1 proteins are required for processing of the major pri-miR171a, spliced and polyadenylated forms of which accumulate in plants homozygous for mutations in either gene, but not in wild-type plants. In transiently transfected Arabidopsis protoplasts, HYL1-mCherry and YFP-DCL1 fusion proteins colocalize to small nuclear bodies similar to Cajal bodies but lacking the Cajal body marker Atcoilin. The HYL1 protein coimmunoprecipitates with miR171a and miR159a precursors, indicating that it is an integral component of the precursor processing machinery. Thus, the distinct HYL1- and DCL1-containing nuclear bodies may be miRNA precursor processing sites. Alternatively, they may be assembly and storage sites for the miRNA precursor processing machinery."

        "abstract": "Dicer is an essential component of RNA interference (RNAi) pathways, which have broad functions in gene regulation and genome organization. Probing the consequences of tissue-restricted Dicer loss in mice indicates a critical role for Dicer during meiosis in the female germline. Mouse oocytes lacking Dicer arrest in meiosis I with multiple disorganized spindles and severe chromosome congression defects. Oogenesis and early development are times of significant post-transcriptional regulation, with controlled mRNA storage, translation, and degradation. Our results suggest that Dicer is essential for turnover of a substantial subset of maternal transcripts that are normally lost during oocyte maturation. Furthermore, we find evidence that transposon-derived sequence elements may contribute to the metabolism of maternal transcripts through a Dicer-dependent pathway. Our studies identify Dicer as central to a regulatory network that controls oocyte gene expression programs and that promotes genomic integrity in a cell type notoriously susceptible to aneuploidy."

We found that a cardiac-specific microRNA (miR-208) encoded by an intron of the alphaMHC gene is required for cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, fibrosis, and expression of betaMHC in response to stress and hypothyroidism. Thus, the alphaMHC gene, in addition to encoding a major cardiac contractile protein, regulates cardiac growth and gene expression in response to stress and hormonal signaling through miR-208."

        "title": "Function and localization of microRNAs in mammalian cells.",
        "abstract": "microRNAs (miRNAs) represent a large set of master regulators of gene expression. They constitute 1-4% of human genes and probably regulate 30% of protein-encoding genes. These small regulatory RNAs act at a posttranscriptional level-mediating translational repression and/or mRNA degradation-through their association with Argonaute protein and target mRNAs. In this paper, we discuss various mechanisms by which miRNAs regulate posttranscriptionally, including their subcellular localization. Recent results indicate that the majority of miRNA-targeted and thus translationally repressed mRNA is probably distributed in the diffuse cytoplasm, even though a small fraction is concentrated in subcellular compartments, such as processing bodies or stress granules; notably, the stress granule localization of Argonaute depends on the presence of miRNAs. Here we discuss the structural requirement of these subcellular compartments in light of their potential miRNA functions."

We are using zebra fish as a model system to study the developmental roles of miRNAs and to determine the mechanisms by which miRNAs regulate target mRNAs. We generated zebra fish embryos that lack the miRNA-processing enzyme Dicer. Mutant embryos are devoid of mature miRNAs and have morphogenesis defects, but differentiate multiple cell types. Injection of miR-430 miRNAs, a miRNA family expressed at the onset of zygotic transcription, rescues the early morphogenesis defects in dicer mutants. miR-430 accelerates the decay of hundreds of maternal mRNAs and induces the deadenylation of target mRNAs. These studies suggest that miRNAs are not obligatory components of all fate specification or signaling pathways but facilitate developmental transitions and induce the deadenylation and decay of hundreds of target mRNAs."

        "abstract": "microRNAs (miRNAs) represent a novel class of genome-encoded eukaryotic regulatory RNAs that silence gene expression posttranscriptionally. Although the proteins mediating miRNA biogenesis and function have been identified, the precise mechanism by which miRNAs regulate the expression of target mRNAs remains unclear. We summarize recent work from our laboratory demonstrating that miRNAs silence gene expression by at least two independent mechanisms: by repressing translation and/or by promoting mRNA degradation. In Drosophila, both mechanisms require Argonaute 1 (AGO1) and the P-body component GW182. Moreover, mRNA degradation by miRNAs is effected by the enzymes involved in general mRNA decay, including deadenylases and decapping enzymes, which also localize to P bodies. Our findings suggest a model for miRNA function in which AGO1 associates with miRNA targets through miRNA:mRNA base-pairing interactions. GW182 interacts with AGO1 and recruits deadenylases and decapping enzymes, leading to mRNA degradation. However, not all miRNA targets are degraded: Some stay in a translationally silent state, from which they may eventually be released. We propose that the final outcome of miRNA regulation (i.e., degradation vs. translational repression) is influenced by other RNA-binding proteins interacting with the targeted mRNA."

        "title": "The expanding universe of noncoding RNAs.",
        "abstract": "The 71st Cold Spring Harbor Symposium on Quantitative Biology celebrated the numerous and expanding roles of regulatory RNAs in systems ranging from bacteria to mammals. It was clearly evident that noncoding RNAs are undergoing a renaissance, with reports of their involvement in nearly every cellular process. Previously known classes of longer noncoding RNAs were shown to function by every possible means-acting catalytically, sensing physiological states through adoption of complex secondary and tertiary structures, or using their primary sequences for recognition of target sites. The many recently discovered classes of small noncoding RNAs, generally less than 35 nucleotides in length, most often exert their effects by guiding regulatory complexes to targets via base-pairing. With the ability to analyze the RNA products of the genome in ever greater depth, it has become clear that the universe of noncoding RNAs may extend far beyond the boundaries we had previously imagined. Thus, as much as the Symposium highlighted exciting progress in the field, it also revealed how much farther we must go to understand fully the biological impact of noncoding RNAs."

        "abstract": "T cell sensitivity to antigen is intrinsically regulated during maturation to ensure proper development of immunity and tolerance, but how this is accomplished remains elusive. Here we show that increasing miR-181a expression in mature T cells augments the sensitivity to peptide antigens, while inhibiting miR-181a expression in the immature T cells reduces sensitivity and impairs both positive and negative selection. Moreover, quantitative regulation of T cell sensitivity by miR-181a enables mature T cells to recognize antagonists-the inhibitory peptide antigens-as agonists. These effects are in part achieved by the downregulation of multiple phosphatases, which leads to elevated steady-state levels of phosphorylated intermediates and a reduction of the T cell receptor signaling threshold. Importantly, higher miR-181a expression correlates with greater T cell sensitivity in immature T cells, suggesting that miR-181a acts as an intrinsic antigen sensitivity \"rheostat\" during T cell development."

        "abstract": "AU-rich elements (AREs), present in mRNA 3'-UTRs, are potent posttranscriptional regulatory signals that can rapidly effect changes in mRNA stability and translation, thereby dramatically altering gene expression with clinical and developmental consequences. In human cell lines, the TNFalpha ARE enhances translation relative to mRNA levels upon serum starvation, which induces cell-cycle arrest. An in vivo crosslinking-coupled affinity purification method was developed to isolate ARE-associated complexes from activated versus basal translation conditions. We surprisingly found two microRNP-related proteins, fragile-X-mental-retardation-related protein 1 (FXR1) and Argonaute 2 (AGO2), that associate with the ARE exclusively during translation activation. Through tethering and shRNA-knockdown experiments, we provide direct evidence for the translation activation function of both FXR1 and AGO2 and demonstrate their interdependence for upregulation. This novel cell-growth-dependent translation activation role for FXR1 and AGO2 allows new insights into ARE-mediated signaling and connects two important posttranscriptional regulatory systems in an unexpected way."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have the potential to regulate the expression of thousands of genes, but the mechanisms that determine whether a gene is targeted or not are poorly understood. We studied the genomic distribution of distances between pairs of identical miRNA seeds and found a propensity for moderate distances greater than about 13 nt between seed starts. Experimental data show that optimal down-regulation is obtained when two seed sites are separated by between 13 and 35 nt. By analyzing the distance between seed sites of endogenous miRNAs and transfected small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), we also find that cooperative targeting of sites with a separation in the optimal range can explain some of the siRNA off-target effects that have been reported in the literature."

        "abstract": "Double-stranded (ds) RNA induces potent gene silencing, termed RNA interference (RNAi). At an early step in RNAi, an RNaseIII-related enzyme, Dicer (DCR-1), processes long-trigger dsRNA into small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). DCR-1 is also required for processing endogenous regulatory RNAs called miRNAs, but how DCR-1 recognizes its endogenous and foreign substrates is not yet understood. Here we show that the C. elegans RNAi pathway gene, rde-4, encodes a dsRNA binding protein that interacts during RNAi with RNA identical to the trigger dsRNA. RDE-4 protein also interacts in vivo with DCR-1, RDE-1, and a conserved DExH-box helicase. Our findings suggest a model in which RDE-4 and RDE-1 function together to detect and retain foreign dsRNA and to present this dsRNA to DCR-1 for processing."

These small RNAs resembled micro-RNAs from animals and were similar in size to small interfering RNAs that accumulated during RNA silencing triggered by multiple types of inducers. Among the 125 sequences identified, the vast majority (90%) arose from intergenic regions, although small RNAs corresponding to predicted protein-coding genes, transposon-like sequences, and a structural RNA gene also were identified. Evidence consistent with the derivation of small RNAs of both polarities, and from highly base-paired precursors, was obtained through the identification and analysis of clusters of small RNA loci. The accumulation of specific small RNAs was regulated developmentally. We propose that Arabidopsis small RNAs participate in a wide range of post-transcriptional and epigenetic events."

Each miRNA may regulate hundreds of genes to control the cell's response to developmental and other environmental cues. The best way to understand the function of a miRNA is to identify the genes that it regulates. Target gene identification is challenging because miRNAs bind to their target mRNAs by partial complementarity over a short sequence, suppression of an individual target gene is often small, and the rules of targeting are not completely understood. Here we review computational and experimental approaches to the identification of miRNA-regulated genes. The examination of changes in gene expression that occur when miRNA expression is altered and biochemical isolation of miRNA-associated transcripts complement target prediction algorithms. Bioinformatic analysis of over-represented pathways and nodes in protein-DNA interactomes formed from experimental candidate miRNA gene target lists can focus attention on biologically significant target genes."

This is due to the finding that microRNAs display altered expression profiles in cancers versus normal tissue. In addition, microRNAs have been associated with cancer progression. In this review, the mechanisms to alter microRNA expression and their relation to cancer will be addressed.

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs are short non-coding RNA molecules that are involved in diverse physiological and developmental processes by controlling the gene expression of target mRNAs. They play important roles in almost all kinds of cancer where they modulate key processes during tumorigenesis such as metastasis, apoptosis, proliferation, or angiogenesis. Depending on the mRNA targets they regulate, they can act as oncogenes or as tumor suppressor genes. Multiple links between microRNA biogenesis and cancer highlight its significance for tumor diseases. However, mechanisms of their own regulation on the transcriptional and posttranscriptional level in health and disease are only beginning to emerge. Here, we review the microRNA-processing pathway as well as recent insights into posttranscriptional regulation of microRNA expression."

They play an important regulatory role at post-transcription level by targeting mRNA cleavage and translation repression. More and more plant miRNAs had been predicted and identified along with the development of bioinformatics and experimental techniques. At stress conditions, plant miRNAs also play a role in adaptation by up-regulating or down-regulating the miRNA expression. The biogenesis, action mode with target genes, bio-logical functions of plant miRNAs, as well as the stress-responsive miRNAs, were reviewed and the methodologies of miRNA study were also briefly summarized in this paper."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) mediate translational repression or degradation of their target messenger RNAs by RNA interference (RNAi). The primary transcripts of miRNA genes (pri-miRNAs) are sequentially processed by the nuclear Drosha-DGCR8 complex to approximately 60-70 nucleotide (nt) intermediates (pre-miRNAs) and then by the cytoplasmic Dicer-TRBP complex to approximately 20-22 nt mature miRNAs. Certain pri-miRNAs are subject to RNA editing that converts adenosine to inosine (A --> I RNA editing); however, the fate of edited pri-miRNAs is mostly unknown. Here, we provide evidence that RNA editing of pri-miR-151 results in complete blockage of its cleavage by Dicer and accumulation of edited pre-miR-151 RNAs. Our results indicate that A --> I conversion at two specific positions of the pre-miRNA foldback structure can affect its interaction with the Dicer-TRBP complex, showing a new regulatory role of A --> I RNA editing in miRNA biogenesis."

        "title": "The mirtron pathway generates microRNA-class regulatory RNAs in Drosophila.",
        "abstract": "The canonical microRNA (miRNA) pathway converts primary hairpin precursor transcripts into approximately 22 nucleotide regulatory RNAs via consecutive cleavages by two RNase III enzymes, Drosha and Dicer. In this study, we characterize Drosophila small RNAs that derive from short intronic hairpins termed \"mirtrons.\" Their nuclear biogenesis appears to bypass Drosha cleavage, which is essential for miRNA biogenesis. Instead, mirtron hairpins are defined by the action of the splicing machinery and lariat-debranching enzyme, which yield pre-miRNA-like hairpins. The mirtron pathway merges with the canonical miRNA pathway during hairpin export by Exportin-5, and both types of hairpins are subsequently processed by Dicer-1/loqs. This generates small RNAs that can repress perfectly matched and seed-matched targets, and we provide evidence that they function, at least in part, via the RNA-induced silencing complex effector Ago1. These findings reveal that mirtrons are an alternate source of miRNA-type regulatory RNAs."

        "title": "Let-7 expression defines two differentiation stages of cancer.",
        "abstract": "The early phases of carcinogenesis resemble embryonic development, often involving the reexpression of embryonic mesenchymal genes. The NCI60 panel of human tumor cell lines can genetically be subdivided into two superclusters (SCs) that correspond to CD95 Type I and II cells. SC1 cells are characterized by a mesenchymal and SC2 cells by an epithelial gene signature, suggesting that SC1 cells represent less differentiated, advanced stages of cancer. miRNAs are small 20- to 22-nucleotide-long noncoding RNAs that inhibit gene expression at the posttranscriptional level. By performing miRNA expression analysis on 10 Type I and 10 Type II cells, we have determined that SC1 cells express low and SC2 cells high levels of the miRNA let-7, respectively, suggesting that let-7 is a marker for less advanced cancers. Expression of the let-7 target high-mobility group A2 (HMGA2), an early embryonic gene, but not of classical epithelial or mesenchymal markers such as E-cadherin or vimentin, inversely correlated with let-7 expression in SC1 and SC2 cells. Using ovarian cancer as a model, we demonstrate that expression of let-7 and HMGA2 is a better predictor of prognosis than classical markers such as E-cadherin, vimentin, and Snail. These data identify loss of let-7 expression as a marker for less differentiated cancer."

        "title": "Common functions for diverse small RNAs of land plants.",
        "abstract": "Endogenous small RNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs) and short interfering RNAs (siRNAs), are critical components of plant gene regulation. Some abundant miRNAs involved in developmental control are conserved between anciently diverged plants, while many other less-abundant miRNAs appear to have recently emerged in the Arabidopsis thaliana lineage. Using large-scale sequencing of small RNAs, we extended the known diversity of miRNAs in basal plants to include 88 confidently annotated miRNA families in the moss Physcomitrella patens and 44 in the lycopod Selaginella moellendorffii. Cleavage of 29 targets directed by 14 distinct P. patens miRNA families and a trans-acting siRNA (ta-siRNA) was experimentally confirmed. Despite a core set of 12 miRNA families also expressed in angiosperms, weakly expressed and apparently lineage-specific miRNAs accounted for the majority of miRNA diversity in both species. Nevertheless, the molecular functions of several of these lineage-specific small RNAs matched those of angiosperms, despite dissimilarities in the small RNA sequences themselves, including small RNAs that mediated negative feedback regulation of the miRNA pathway and miR390-dependent ta-siRNAs that guided the cleavage of AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR mRNAs. Diverse, lineage-specific, small RNAs can therefore perform common biological functions in plants."

        "title": "The Drosophila RNA methyltransferase, DmHen1, modifies germline piRNAs and single-stranded siRNAs in RISC.",
        "abstract": "Small silencing RNAs repress gene expression by a set of related mechanisms collectively called RNA-silencing pathways [1, 2]. In the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway [3], small interfering mRNA (siRNAs) defend cells from invasion by foreign nucleic acids, such as those produced by viruses. In contrast, microRNAs (miRNAs) sculpt endogenous mRNA expression [4]. A third class of small RNAs, Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), defends the genome from transposons [5-9]. Here, we report that Drosophila piRNAs contain a 2'-O-methyl group on their 3' termini; this is a modification previously reported for plant miRNAs and siRNAs [10] and mouse and rat piRNAs [11, 12, 13]. Plant small-RNA methylation is catalyzed by the protein HEN1 [10, 14, 15]. We find that DmHen1, the Drosophila homolog of HEN1, methylates the termini of siRNAs and piRNAs. Without DmHen1, the length and abundance of piRNAs are decreased, and piRNA function is perturbed. Unlike plant HEN1, DmHen1 acts on single strands, not duplexes, explaining how it can use as substrates both siRNAs-which derive from double-stranded precursors-and piRNAs-which do not [8, 13]. 2'-O-methylation of siRNAs may be the final step in assembly of the RNAi-enzyme complex, RISC, occurring after an Argonaute-bound siRNA duplex is converted to single-stranded RNA."

In order to identify miRNAs and to assess their expression patterns, we sequenced over 250 small RNA libraries from 26 different organ systems and cell types of human and rodents that were enriched in neuronal as well as normal and malignant hematopoietic cells and tissues. We present expression profiles derived from clone count data and provide computational tools for their analysis. Unexpectedly, a relatively small set of miRNAs, many of which are ubiquitously expressed, account for most of the differences in miRNA profiles between cell lineages and tissues. This broad survey also provides detailed and accurate information about mature sequences, precursors, genome locations, maturation processes, inferred transcriptional units, and conservation patterns. We also propose a subclassification scheme for miRNAs for assisting future experimental and computational functional analyses."

        "abstract": "Genome-encoded microRNAs (miRNAs) are potent regulators of gene expression. The significance of miRNAs in various biological processes has been suggested by studies showing an important role of these small RNAs in regulation of cell differentiation. However, the role of miRNAs in regulation of differentiated cell physiology is not well established. Mature neurons express a large number of distinct miRNAs, but the role of miRNAs in postmitotic neurons has not been examined. Here, we provide evidence for an essential role of miRNAs in survival of differentiated neurons. We show that conditional Purkinje cell-specific ablation of the key miRNA-generating enzyme Dicer leads to Purkinje cell death. Deficiency in Dicer is associated with progressive loss of miRNAs, followed by cerebellar degeneration and development of ataxia. The progressive neurodegeneration in the absence of Dicer raises the possibility of an involvement of miRNAs in neurodegenerative disorders."

        "title": "Sequence and expression differences underlie functional specialization of Arabidopsis microRNAs miR159 and miR319.",
        "abstract": "Many microRNAs (miRNAs) are encoded by small gene families. In a third of all conserved Arabidopsis miRNA families, members vary at two or more nucleotide positions. We have focused on the related miR159 and miR319 families, which share sequence identity at 17 of 21 nucleotides, yet affect different developmental processes through distinct targets. MiR159 regulates MYB mRNAs, while miR319 predominantly acts on TCP mRNAs. In the case of miR319, MYB targeting plays at most a minor role because miR319 expression levels and domain limit its ability to affect MYB mRNAs. In contrast, in the case of miR159, the miRNA sequence prevents effective TCP targeting. We complement these observations by identifying nucleotide positions relevant for miRNA activity with mutants recovered from a suppressor screen. Together, our findings reveal that functional specialization of miR159 and miR319 is achieved through both expression and sequence differences."

        "title": "MicroRNA targeting specificity in mammals: determinants beyond seed pairing.",
        "abstract": "Mammalian microRNAs (miRNAs) pair to 3'UTRs of mRNAs to direct their posttranscriptional repression. Important for target recognition are approximately 7 nt sites that match the seed region of the miRNA. However, these seed matches are not always sufficient for repression, indicating that other characteristics help specify targeting. By combining computational and experimental approaches, we uncovered five general features of site context that boost site efficacy: AU-rich nucleotide composition near the site, proximity to sites for coexpressed miRNAs (which leads to cooperative action), proximity to residues pairing to miRNA nucleotides 13-16, positioning within the 3'UTR at least 15 nt from the stop codon, and positioning away from the center of long UTRs. A model combining these context determinants quantitatively predicts site performance both for exogenously added miRNAs and for endogenous miRNA-message interactions. Because it predicts site efficacy without recourse to evolutionary conservation, the model also identifies effective nonconserved sites and siRNA off-targets."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are causing tremendous excitement in cancer research. MiRNAs are a large class of short non-coding RNAs that are found in many plants, animals and DNA viruses and often act to inhibit gene expression post-transcriptionally. Approximately 500 miRNA genes have been identified in the human genome. Their function is largely unknown, but data from worms, flies, fish and mice suggest that they have important roles in animal growth, development, homeostasis and disease. MiRNA expression profiles demonstrate that many miRNAs are deregulated in human cancers. MiRNAs have been shown to regulate oncogenes, tumour suppressors and a number of cancer-related genes controlling cell cycle, apoptosis, cell migration and angiogenesis. MiRNAs encoded by the mir-17-92 cluster have oncogenic potential and others may act as tumour suppressors. Some miRNAs and their target sites were found to be mutated in cancer. MiRNAs may have great diagnostic potential for human cancer and even miRNA-based cancer therapies may be on the horizon."

        "title": "Enhancement of the seed-target recognition step in RNA silencing by a PIWI/MID domain protein.",
        "abstract": "Target recognition in RNA silencing is governed by the \"seed sequence\" of a guide RNA strand associated with the PIWI/MID domain of an Argonaute protein in RISC. Using a reconstituted in vitro target recognition system, we show that a model PIWI/MID domain protein confers position-dependent tightening and loosening of guide-strand-target interactions. Over the seed sequence, the interaction affinity is enhanced up to approximately 300-fold. Enhancement is achieved through a reduced entropy penalty for the interaction. In contrast, interactions 3' of the seed are inhibited. We quantified mismatched target recognition inside and outside the seed, revealing amplified discrimination at the third position in the seed mediated by the PIWI/MID domain. Thus, association of the guide strand with the PIWI/MID domain generates an enhanced affinity anchor site over the seed that can promote fidelity in target recognition and stabilize and guide the assembly of the active silencing complex."

        "abstract": "The term epigenetics refers to heritable changes not encoded by DNA. The organization of DNA into chromatin fibers affects gene expression in a heritable manner and is therefore one mechanism of epigenetic inheritance. Large parts of eukaryotic genomes consist of constitutively highly condensed heterochromatin, important for maintaining genome integrity but also for silencing of genes within. Small RNA, together with factors typically associated with RNA interference (RNAi) targets homologous DNA sequences and recruits factors that modify the chromatin, commonly resulting in formation of heterochromatin and silencing of target genes. The scope of this review is to provide an overview of the roles of small RNA and the RNAi components, Dicer, Argonaute and RNA dependent polymerases in epigenetic inheritance via heterochromatin formation, exemplified with pathways from unicellular eukaryotes, plants and animals."

        "title": "Lin-28B transactivation is necessary for Myc-mediated let-7 repression and proliferation.",
        "abstract": "Direct control of microRNA (miRNA) expression by oncogenic and tumor suppressor networks results in frequent dysregulation of miRNAs in cancer cells and contributes to tumorigenesis. We previously demonstrated that activation of the c-Myc oncogenic transcription factor (Myc) broadly influences miRNA expression and in particular leads to widespread miRNA down-regulation. miRNA transcripts repressed by Myc include several with potent tumor suppressor activity such as miR-15a/16-1, miR-34a, and let-7 family members. In this study, we have investigated mechanisms downstream of Myc that contribute to miRNA repression. Consistent with transcriptional down-regulation, Myc activity results in the decreased abundance of multiple miRNA primary transcripts. Surprisingly, however, primary transcripts encoding several let-7 miRNAs are not reduced in the high Myc state, suggesting a posttranscriptional mechanism of repression. The Lin-28 and Lin-28B RNA binding proteins were recently demonstrated to negatively regulate let-7 biogenesis. We now show that Myc induces Lin-28B expression in multiple human and mouse tumor models. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and reporter assays reveal direct association of Myc with the Lin-28B promoter resulting in transcriptional transactivation. Moreover, we document that activation of Lin-28B is necessary and sufficient for Myc-mediated let-7 repression. Accordingly, Lin-28B loss-of-function significantly impairs Myc-dependent cellular proliferation. These findings highlight an important role for Lin-28B in Myc-driven cellular phenotypes and uncover an orchestration of transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms in Myc-mediated reprogramming of miRNA expression."

Increased lin-41 activity causes the opposite phenotype, reiteration of larval fates. let-7 mutations cause similar reiterated heterochronic phenotypes that are suppressed by lin-41 mutations, showing that lin-41 is negatively regulated by let-7. lin-41 negatively regulates the timing of LIN-29 adult specification transcription factor expression. lin-41 encodes an RBCC protein, and two elements in the lin-413'UTR are complementary to the 21 nucleotide let-7 regulatory RNA. A lin-41::GFP fusion gene is downregulated in the tissues affected by lin-41 at the time that the let-7 regulatory RNA is upregulated. We suggest that late larval activation of let-7 RNA expression downregulates LIN-41 to relieve inhibition of lin-29."

        "abstract": "PAZ PIWI domain (PPD) proteins, together with the RNA cleavage products of Dicer, form ribonucleoprotein complexes called RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISCs). RISCs mediate gene silencing through targeted messenger RNA cleavage and translational suppression. The PAZ domains of PPD and Dicer proteins were originally thought to mediate binding between PPD proteins and Dicer, although no evidence exists to support this theory. Here we show that PAZ domains are not required for PPD protein-Dicer interactions. Rather, a subregion of the PIWI domain in PPD proteins, the PIWI-box, binds directly to the Dicer RNase III domain. Stable binding between PPD proteins and Dicer was dependent on the activity of Hsp90. Unexpectedly, binding of PPD proteins to Dicer inhibits the RNase activity of this enzyme in vitro. Lastly, we show that PPD proteins and Dicer are present in soluble and membrane-associated fractions, indicating that interactions between these two types of proteins may occur in multiple compartments."

Loss-of-function mutations resulting in suppression of PEV have identified critical components of heterochromatin, including proteins HP1, HP2, and histone H3 lysine 9 methyltransferase. Here, we demonstrate that this silencing is dependent on the RNA interference machinery, using tandem mini-white arrays and white transgenes in heterochromatin to show loss of silencing as a result of mutations in piwi, aubergine, or spindle-E (homeless), which encode RNAi components. These mutations result in reduction of H3 Lys9 methylation and delocalization of HP1 and HP2, most dramatically in spindle-E mutants."

        "title": "Detection of 91 potential conserved plant microRNAs in Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa identifies important target genes.",
        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an extensive class of tiny RNA molecules that regulate the expression of target genes by means of complementary base pair interactions. Although the first miRNAs were discovered in Caenorhabditis elegans, >300 miRNAs were recently documented in animals and plants, both by cloning methods and computational predictions. We present a genome-wide computational approach to detect miRNA genes in the Arabidopsis thaliana genome. Our method is based on the conservation of short sequences between the genomes of Arabidopsis and rice (Oryza sativa) and on properties of the secondary structure of the miRNA precursor. The method was fine-tuned to take into account plant-specific properties, such as the variable length of the miRNA precursor sequences. In total, 91 potential miRNA genes were identified, of which 58 had at least one nearly perfect match with an Arabidopsis mRNA, constituting the potential targets of those miRNAs. In addition to already known transcription factors involved in plant development, the targets also comprised genes involved in several other cellular processes, such as sulfur assimilation and ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation. These findings considerably broaden the scope of miRNA functions in plants."

        "title": "MicroRNA control of PHABULOSA in leaf development: importance of pairing to the microRNA 5' region.",
        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are approximately 22-nucleotide noncoding RNAs that can regulate gene expression by directing mRNA degradation or inhibiting productive translation. Dominant mutations in PHABULOSA (PHB) and PHAVOLUTA (PHV) map to a miR165/166 complementary site and impair miRNA-guided cleavage of these mRNAs in vitro. Here, we confirm that disrupted miRNA pairing, not changes in PHB protein sequence, causes the developmental defects in phb-d mutants. In planta, disrupting miRNA pairing near the center of the miRNA complementary site had far milder developmental consequences than more distal mismatches. These differences correlated with differences in miRNA-directed cleavage efficiency in vitro, where mismatch scanning revealed more tolerance for mismatches at the center and 3' end of the miRNA compared to mismatches to the miRNA 5' region. In this respect, miR165/166 resembles animal miRNAs in its pairing requirements. Pairing to the 5' portion of the small silencing RNA appears crucial regardless of the mode of post-transcriptional repression or whether it occurs in plants or animals, supporting a model in which this region of the silencing RNA nucleates pairing to its target."

        "abstract": "Little is known about the expression levels or function of micro-RNAs (miRNAs) in normal and neoplastic cells, although it is becoming clear that miRNAs play important roles in the regulation of gene expression during development [Ambros, V. (2003) Cell 113, 673-676; McManus, M. T. (2003) Semin. Cancer Biol. 13, 253-258]. We now report the genomewide expression profiling of miRNAs in human B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) by using a microarray containing hundreds of human precursor and mature miRNA oligonucleotide probes. This approach allowed us to identify significant differences in miRNome expression between CLL samples and normal CD5+ B cells; data were confirmed by Northern blot analyses and real-time RT-PCR. At least two distinct clusters of CLL samples can be identified that were associated with the presence or absence of Zap-70 expression, a predictor of early disease progression. Two miRNA signatures were associated with the presence or absence of mutations in the expressed Ig variableregion genes or with deletions at 13q14, respectively. These data suggest that miRNA expression patterns have relevance to the biological and clinical behavior of this leukemia."

However, the identity of \"Slicer,\" the enzyme that cleaves the messenger RNA (mRNA) as directed by the siRNA, has not been resolved. Here, we report the crystal structure of the Argonaute protein from Pyrococcus furiosus at 2.25 angstrom resolution. The structure reveals a crescent-shaped base made up of the amino-terminal, middle, and PIWI domains. The Piwi Argonaute Zwille (PAZ) domain is held above the base by a \"stalk\"-like region. The PIWI domain (named for the protein piwi) is similar to ribonuclease H, with a conserved active site aspartate-aspartate-glutamate motif, strongly implicating Argonaute as \"Slicer.\" The architecture of the molecule and the placement of the PAZ and PIWI domains define a groove for substrate binding and suggest a mechanism for siRNA-guided mRNA cleavage."

        "abstract": "Gene silencing through RNA interference (RNAi) is carried out by RISC, the RNA-induced silencing complex. RISC contains two signature components, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and Argonaute family proteins. Here, we show that the multiple Argonaute proteins present in mammals are both biologically and biochemically distinct, with a single mammalian family member, Argonaute2, being responsible for messenger RNA cleavage activity. This protein is essential for mouse development, and cells lacking Argonaute2 are unable to mount an experimental response to siRNAs. Mutations within a cryptic ribonuclease H domain within Argonaute2, as identified by comparison with the structure of an archeal Argonaute protein, inactivate RISC. Thus, our evidence supports a model in which Argonaute contributes \"Slicer\" activity to RISC, providing the catalytic engine for RNAi."

        "abstract": "We have analysed the role of a microRNA, miR164, in boundary formation during organ initiation from Arabidopsis meristems. The establishment and maintenance of the boundary domain are controlled by three partially redundant genes, CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON1 (CUC1), CUC2 and CUC3. We show that miR164 overexpression phenocopies the cuc1 cuc2 double mutant by inducing post-transcriptional downregulation of CUC1 and CUC2 but not CUC3 mRNA levels. Disruption of CUC2 regulation by miR164, either by making CUC2 resistant to the miRNA or by reducing miRNA levels leads to similar enlarged boundary domains. We relate this enlargement to the division patterns of the boundary cells. We propose that miR164 constrains the expansion of the boundary domain, by degrading CUC1 and CUC2 mRNAs."

Using human tissue culture cells, we show that promoter-directed siRNA inhibits transcription of an integrated, proviral, elongation factor 1alpha (EF1A) promoter-green fluorescent protein reporter gene and of endogenous EF1A. Silencing was associated with DNA methylation of the targeted sequence, and it required either active transport of siRNA into the nucleus or permeabilization of the nuclear envelope by lentiviral transduction.

        "abstract": "Posttranscriptional silencing (PTGS) in plants, nematodes, Drosophila, and perhaps all eukaryotes operates by sequence-specific degradation or translational inhibition of the target mRNA. These processes are mediated by duplexed RNA. In Drosophila and nematodes, double-stranded (ds)RNA or self-complementary RNA is processed into fragments of approximately 21 nt by Dicer-1. These small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) serve as guides to target degradation of homologous single-stranded (ss)RNA. In some cases, the approximately 21 nt guide fragments derived from endogenous, imperfectly self-complementary RNAs cause translational inhibition of their target mRNAs, with which they have substantial, but not perfect sequence complementarity. These small temporal RNAs (stRNAs) belong to a class of noncoding microRNAs (miRNAs), 20-24 nt in length, that are found in flies, plants, nematodes, and mammals. In nematodes, the Dicer-1 enzyme catalyzes the production of both siRNA and stRNA. Mutation of the Arabidopsis Dicer-1 homolog, CARPEL FACTORY (CAF), blocks miRNA production. Here, we report that the same caf mutant does not block either PTGS or siRNA production induced by self-complementary hairpin RNA. This suggests either that this mutation only impairs miRNA formation or, more interestingly, that plants have two distinct dicer-like enzymes, one for miRNA and another for siRNAi production."

        "abstract": "The molecular basis for virus-induced disease in plants has been a long-standing mystery. Infection of Arabidopsis by Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) induces a number of developmental defects in vegetative and reproductive organs. We found that these defects, many of which resemble those in miRNA-deficient dicer-like1 (dcl1) mutants, were due to the TuMV-encoded RNA-silencing suppressor, P1/HC-Pro. Suppression of RNA silencing is a counterdefensive mechanism that enables systemic infection by TuMV. The suppressor interfered with the activity of miR171 (also known as miRNA39), which directs cleavage of several mRNAs coding for Scarecrow-like transcription factors, by inhibiting miR171-guided nucleolytic function. Out of ten other mRNAs that were validated as miRNA-guided cleavage targets, eight accumulated to elevated levels in the presence of P1/HC-Pro. The basis for TuMV- and other virus-induced disease in plants may be explained, at least partly, by interference with miRNA-controlled developmental pathways that share components with the antiviral RNA-silencing pathway."

Besides detailed mechanistic studies on their generation and function, there has been a great deal of interest in the study of miRNA as surrogate markers of disease. Numerous studies have attempted to define miRNA profiles as predictors of disease outcome, or for the classification/diagnosis of different pathologies. In the present review, we summarize the main studies describing the involvement of miRNA in bone marrow (BM) diseases and in normal BM function during hematopoiesis."

        "abstract": "The finding that sequence-specific gene silencing occurs in response to the presence of double-stranded RNAs has had an enormous impact on biology, uncovering an unsuspected level of regulation of gene expression. This process, known as RNA interference (RNAi) or RNA silencing, involves small non-coding RNAs, which associate with nuclease-containing regulatory complexes and then pair with complementary messenger RNA targets, thereby preventing the expression of these mRNAs. Remarkable progress has been made towards understanding the underlying mechanisms of RNAi, raising the prospect of deciphering the 'RNAi code' that, like transcription factors, allows the fine-tuning and networking of complex suites of gene activity, thereby specifying cellular physiology and development."

        "abstract": "In eukaryotes, small non-coding RNAs regulate gene expression, helping to control cellular metabolism, growth and differentiation, to maintain genome integrity, and to combat viruses and mobile genetic elements. These pathways involve two specialized ribonucleases that control the production and function of small regulatory RNAs. The enzyme Dicer cleaves double-stranded RNA precursors, generating short interfering RNAs and microRNAs in the cytoplasm. These small RNAs are transferred to Argonaute proteins, which guide the sequence-specific silencing of messenger RNAs that contain complementary sequences by either enzymatically cleaving the mRNA or repressing its translation. The molecular structures of Dicer and the Argonaute proteins, free and bound to small RNAs, have offered exciting insights into the molecular mechanisms that are central to RNA silencing pathways."

Studies in fission yeast and multicellular organisms suggest that effector complexes, directed by small RNAs, target nascent chromatin-bound non-coding RNAs and recruit chromatin-modifying complexes. Interactions between small RNAs and nascent non-coding transcripts thus reveal a new mechanism for targeting chromatin-modifying complexes to specific chromosome regions and suggest possibilities for how the resultant chromatin states may be inherited during the process of chromosome duplication."

Their role in normal hematopoiesis is being elucidated by an increasing number of studies, revealing specific variations of the miRNome (defined as the full complement of miRNAs in a genome) during the commitment and development of the hematological stem cells in the different lineages. Aberrancies of the normal miRNome have also been well documented in almost all hematological malignancies, suggesting, in most cases, specific miRNA-signatures. Intriguingly, some of the miRNA-expression abnormalities described in leukemias and lymphomas can be interpreted on the basis of the miRNome variations during normal hematologic ontogeny, revealing their origin from the particular differentiation stage in which the hematopoietic differentiation has been 'frozen' in the malignancy."

        "abstract": "Target prediction for animal microRNAs (miRNAs) has been hindered by the small number of verified targets available to evaluate the accuracy of predicted miRNA-target interactions. Recently, a dataset of 3,404 miRNA-associated mRNA transcripts was identified by immunoprecipitation of the RNA-induced silencing complex components AIN-1 and AIN-2. Our analysis of this AIN-IP dataset revealed enrichment for defining characteristics of functional miRNA-target interactions, including structural accessibility of target sequences, total free energy of miRNA-target hybridization and topology of base-pairing to the 5' seed region of the miRNA. We used these enriched characteristics as the basis for a quantitative miRNA target prediction method, miRNA targets by weighting immunoprecipitation-enriched parameters (mirWIP), which optimizes sensitivity to verified miRNA-target interactions and specificity to the AIN-IP dataset. MirWIP can be used to capture all known conserved miRNA-mRNA target relationships in Caenorhabditis elegans at a lower false-positive rate than can the current standard methods."

This unique property is controlled by dynamic interplays between extrinsic signalling, epigenetic, transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulations. Recent research indicates that microRNAs (miRNAs) have an important role in regulating stem cell self-renewal and differentiation by repressing the translation of selected mRNAs in stem cells and differentiating daughter cells. Such a role has been shown in embryonic stem cells, germline stem cells and various somatic tissue stem cells. These findings reveal a new dimension of gene regulation in controlling stem cell fate and behaviour."

We show that Imp8 interacts with Ago proteins and localizes to cytoplasmic processing bodies (P bodies), structures involved in RNA metabolism. Furthermore, we detect Ago2 in the nucleus of HeLa cells, and knockdown of Imp8 reduces the nuclear Ago2 pool. Using immunoprecipitations of Ago2-associated mRNAs followed by microarray analysis, we further demonstrate that Imp8 is required for the recruitment of Ago protein complexes to a large set of Ago2-associated target mRNAs, allowing for efficient and specific gene silencing. Therefore, we provide evidence that Imp8 is required for cytoplasmic miRNA-guided gene silencing and affects nuclear localization of Ago proteins."

Here we show that Drosha cleavage occurs during transcription acting on both independently transcribed and intron-encoded miRNAs. We also show that both 5'-3' and 3'-5' exonucleases associate with the sites where co-transcriptional Drosha cleavage occurs, promoting intron degradation before splicing. We finally demonstrate that miRNAs can also derive from 3' flanking transcripts of Pol II genes. Our results demonstrate that multiple miRNA-containing transcripts are co-transcriptionally cleaved during their synthesis and suggest that exonucleolytic degradation from Drosha cleavage sites in pre-mRNAs may influence the splicing and maturation of numerous mRNAs."

        "abstract": "Micro- and short-interfering RNAs represent small RNA family that are recognized as critical regulatory species across the eukaryotes. Recent high-throughput sequencing have revealed two more hidden players of the cellular small RNA pool. Reported in mammals and Caenorhabditis elegans respectively, these new small RNAs are named piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) and 21U-RNAs. Moreover, small RNAs including miRNAs have been identified in unicellular alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, redefining the earlier concept of multi-cellularity restricted presence of these molecules. The discovery of these species of small RNAs has allowed us to understand better the usage of genome and the number of genes present but also have complicated the situation in terms of biochemical attributes and functional genesis of these molecules. Nonetheless, these new pools of knowledge have opened up avenues for unraveling the finer details of the small RNA mediated pathways."

        "abstract": "MicroRNA (miRNA) silencing fine-tunes protein output and regulates diverse biological processes. Argonaute (Ago) proteins are the core effectors of the miRNA pathway. In lower organisms, multiple Agos have evolved specialized functions for distinct RNA silencing pathways. However, the roles of mammalian Agos have not been well characterized. Here we show that mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells deficient for Ago1-4 are completely defective in miRNA silencing and undergo apoptosis. In miRNA silencing-defective ES cells, the proapoptotic protein Bim, a miRNA target, is increased, and up-regulation of Bim is sufficient to induce ES cell apoptosis. Expression of activated Akt inhibits Bim expression and partially rescues the growth defect in Ago-deficient ES cells. Furthermore, reintroduction of any single Ago into Ago-deficient cells is able to rescue the endogenous miRNA silencing defect and apoptosis. Consistent with this, each Ago is functionally equivalent with bulged miRNA duplexes for translational repression, whereas Ago1 and Ago2 appear to be more effective at utilizing perfectly matched siRNAs. Thus, our results demonstrate that mammalian Agos all contribute to miRNA silencing, and individual Agos have largely overlapping functions in this process."

        "title": "MicroRNA and cancer--focus on apoptosis.",
        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRs) are small non-coding RNAs regulating gene expression at the post-transcriptional and/or translational levels. miRs play important roles in diverse biological processes, including development, cell differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis. Recent evidence has shown that miR loci frequently map to cancer-associated genomic regions and deregulated miR expression profiles are associated with many cancer types, implicating miRs in crucial processes that lead to tumourigenesis. Here, we review the current findings about miRs and tumourigenesis, focusing on their involvement in the apoptosis pathway. A significant observation is that greater than one-quarter of all known human miRs were reported to be deregulated in at least one cancer type. The expression of a subset of miRs (e.g. miR-21 and miR-155) was found to be consistently up-regulated, whereas another subset of miRs (e.g.miR-143 and miR-145) was consistently down-regulated across different cancer types suggesting their involvement in regulating common cellular processes whose deregulation may lead to tumourigenesis. Several miRs were implicated to play roles in cell proliferation and apoptosis. Some miRs, such as miR-29b and miR-15-16, influence only the apoptotic pathway, whereas others including let-7/miR-98 and miR-17-92 may play roles in both the apoptotic and cell-proliferation pathways. In conclusion, although our current understanding of the functions of miRs is still fragmentary, taken together, this review highlights the complex and intricate roles that miRs play in the regulation of cellular processes. Perturbation of the expression of miRs may thus lead to tumourigenesis."

        "abstract": "More than 1000 microRNAs (miRNAs) are expressed in human cells, some tissue or cell type specific, others considered as house-keeping molecules. Functions and direct mRNA targets for some miRNAs have been relatively well studied over the last years. Every miRNA potentially regulates the expression of numerous protein-coding genes (tens to hundreds), but it has become increasingly clear that not all miRNAs are equally important; diverse high-throughput screenings of various systems have identified a limited number of key functional miRNAs over and over again. Particular miRNAs emerge as principal regulators that control major cell functions in various physiological and pathophysiological settings. Since its identification 3 years ago as the miRNA most commonly and strongly up-regulated in human brain tumour glioblastoma [1], miR-21 has attracted the attention of researchers in various fields, such as development, oncology, stem cell biology and aging, becoming one of the most studied miRNAs, along with let-7, miR-17-92 cluster ('oncomir-1'), miR-155 and a few others. However, an miR-21 knockout mouse has not yet been generated, and the data about miR-21 functions in normal cells are still very limited. In this review, we summarise the current knowledge of miR-21 functions in human disease, with an emphasis on its regulation, oncogenic role, targets in human cancers, potential as a disease biomarker and novel therapeutic target in oncology."

Over the past 5 years, significant advances have been made towards understanding the pathways that generate miRNAs and the mechanisms by which miRNAs exert their regulatory functions.

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) interact with target sites located in the 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs) of mRNAs to downregulate their expression when the appropriate miRNA is bound to target mRNA. To establish the functional importance of target-site localization in the 3' UTR, we modified the stop codon to extend the coding region of the transgene reporter through the miRNA target sequence. As a result, the miRNAs lost their ability to inhibit translation but retained their ability to function as small interfering RNAs in mammalian cells in culture and in vivo. The addition of rare but not optimal codons upstream of the extended opening reading frame (ORF) made the miRNA target site more accessible and restored miRNA-induced translational knockdown. Taken together, these results suggest that active translation impedes miRNA-programmed RISC association with target mRNAs and support a mechanistic explanation for the localization of most miRNA target sites in noncoding regions of mRNAs in mammals."

        "abstract": "Formation of microRNA (miRNA) requires an RNaseIII domain-containing protein, termed DICER-1 in animals and DICER-LIKE1 (DCL1) in plants, to catalyze processing of an RNA precursor with a fold-back structure. Loss-of-function dcl1 mutants of Arabidopsis have low levels of miRNA and exhibit a range of developmental phenotypes in vegetative, reproductive, and embryonic tissues. In this paper, we show that DCL1 mRNA occurs in multiple forms, including truncated molecules that result from aberrant pre-mRNA processing. Both full-length and truncated forms accumulated to relatively low levels in plants containing a functional DCL1 gene. However, in dcl1 mutant plants, dcl1 RNA forms accumulated to levels several-fold higher than those in DCL1 plants. Elevated levels of DCL1 RNAs were also detected in miRNA-defective hen1 mutant plants and in plants expressing a virus-encoded suppressor of RNA silencing (P1/HC-Pro), which inhibits miRNA-guided degradation of target mRNAs. A miRNA (miR162) target sequence was predicted near the middle of DCL1 mRNA, and a DCL1-derived RNA with the properties of a miR162-guided cleavage product was identified and mapped. These results indicate that DCL1 mRNA is subject to negative feedback regulation through the activity of a miRNA."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small regulatory RNAs that are between 21 and 25 nucleotides in length and repress gene function through interactions with target mRNAs. The genomes of metazoans encode on the order of several hundred miRNAs, but the processes they regulate have been defined for only two in C. elegans. We searched for new inhibitors of apoptotic cell death by testing existing collections of P element insertion lines for their ability to enhance a small-eye phenotype associated with eye-specific expression of the Drosophila cell death activator Reaper. Here we report the identification of the Drosophila miRNA mir-14 as a cell death suppressor. Loss of mir-14 enhances Reaper-dependent cell death, whereas ectopic expression suppresses cell death induced by multiple stimuli. Animals lacking mir-14 are viable. However, they are stress sensitive and have a reduced lifespan. Mir-14 mutants have elevated levels of the apoptotic effector caspase Drice, suggesting one potential site of action. Mir-14 also regulates fat metabolism. Deletion of mir-14 results in animals with increased levels of triacylglycerol and diacylglycerol, whereas increases in mir-14 copy number have the converse effect. We discuss possible relationships between these phenotypes."

        "abstract": "Temporal control of development is an important aspect of pattern formation that awaits complete molecular analysis. We identified lin-57 as a member of the C. elegans heterochronic gene pathway, which ensures that postembryonic developmental events are appropriately timed. Loss of lin-57 function causes the hypodermis to terminally differentiate and acquire adult character prematurely. lin-57 is hbl-1, revealing a role for the worm hunchback homolog in control of developmental time. Significantly, fly hunchback (hb) temporally specifies cell fates in the nervous system. The hbl-1/lin-57 3'UTR is required for postembryonic downregulation in the hypodermis and nervous system and contains multiple putative binding sites for temporally regulated microRNAs, including let-7. Indeed, we find that hbl-1/lin-57 is regulated by let-7, at least in the nervous system. Examination of the hb 3'UTR reveals potential binding sites for known fly miRNAs. Thus, evolutionary conservation of hunchback genes may include temporal control of cell fate specification and microRNA-mediated regulation."

        "title": "The C elegans hunchback homolog, hbl-1, controls temporal patterning and is a probable microRNA target.",
        "abstract": "hunchback regulates the temporal identity of neuroblasts in Drosophila. Here we show that hbl-1, the C. elegans hunchback ortholog, also controls temporal patterning. Furthermore, hbl-1 is a probable target of microRNA regulation through its 3'UTR. hbl-1 loss-of-function causes the precocious expression of adult seam cell fates. This phenotype is similar to loss-of-function of lin-41, a known target of the let-7 microRNA. Like lin-41 mutations, hbl-1 loss-of-function partially suppresses a let-7 mutation. The hbl-1 3'UTR is both necessary and sufficient to downregulate a reporter gene during development, and the let-7 and lin-4 microRNAs are both required for HBL-1/GFP downregulation. Multiple elements in the hbl-1 3'UTR show complementarity to regulatory microRNAs, suggesting that microRNAs directly control hbl-1. MicroRNAs may likewise function to regulate Drosophila hunchback during temporal patterning of the nervous system."

        "abstract": "In animals, double-stranded short interfering RNA (siRNA) and single-stranded microRNA (miRNA) regulate gene expression by targeting homologous mRNA for cleavage or by interfering with their translation, respectively. siRNAs are processed from injected or transgene-derived, long, perfect double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), while miRNAs are processed from short, imperfect dsRNA precursors transcribed from endogenous intergenic regions. In plants, both siRNAs and miRNAs activate cleavage of homologous RNA targets, but little is known about the genes controlling their production or action. The SGS2/SDE1 protein contributes to produce transgene siRNA, while DCL1 and HEN1 contribute to endogenous miRNA accumulation. Here, we show that: i) SGS2, SGS3, AGO1, and HEN1 contribute to produce transgene siRNA involved in sense posttranscriptional gene silencing (S-PTGS); ii) HEN1, but not SGS2, SGS3, or AGO1, contributes to the accumulation of the endogenous miR171 miRNA and to the cleavage of Scarecrow target mRNA by miR171; iii) SGS2, SGS3, AGO1, and HEN1 contribute to resistance against cucumber mosaic virus, but not to siRNA and IR-PTGS triggered by hairpin transgenes directly producing perfect dsRNA; and iv) the actions of HEN1 in miRNA/development and siRNA/S-PTGS can be uncoupled by single-point mutations at different positions in the protein."

Among the ncRNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs) have recently been highlighted extensively for their pivotal role in disease, fertility and development through post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. The presence and spatio-temporal expression of miRNAs and miRNA processing machinery genes in oocytes and preimplantation embryos has evidenced the involvement of miRNAs for growth and maturation of mammalian oocytes, early embryonic development, stem cell lineage differentiation and implantation. Therefore, this article aims to highlight primary evidences on the importance of miRNAs and their mediated translational reprogramming in the physiology and development of mammalian oocytes and embryos."

        "abstract": "As master gene regulators, microRNAs are involved in diverse cellular pathways. It is well known that microRNAs are often dysregulated in many types of cancer and other human diseases. In cancer, microRNAs may function as oncogenes or tumor suppressors. Interestingly, recent evidence suggests that microRNA-mediated gene regulation interconnects with the Akt pathway, forming an Akt-microRNA regulatory network. MicroRNAs and Akt in this network work together to exert their cellular functions. Thus, a better understanding of this Akt-microRNA regulatory network is critical to successful targeting of the PI3K/Akt pathway for cancer therapy. We review recent advances in the understanding of how microRNAs affect Akt activity as well as how microRNAs are regulated through the Akt pathway. We also briefly discuss the clinical implication of gene regulation mediated through Akt-associated microRNAs."

        "abstract": "RNA interference (RNAi) was first recognized in Caenorhabditis elegans as a biological response to exogenous double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), which induces sequence-specific gene silencing. RNAi represents a conserved regulatory motif, which is present in a wide range of eukaryotic organisms. Recently, we and others have shown that endogenously encoded triggers of gene silencing act through elements of the RNAi machinery to regulate the expression of protein-coding genes. These small temporal RNAs (stRNAs) are transcribed as short hairpin precursors (approximately 70 nt), processed into active, 21-nt RNAs by Dicer, and recognize target mRNAs via base-pairing interactions. Here, we show that short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) can be engineered to suppress the expression of desired genes in cultured Drosophila and mammalian cells. shRNAs can be synthesized exogenously or can be transcribed from RNA polymerase III promoters in vivo, thus permitting the construction of continuous cell lines or transgenic animals in which RNAi enforces stable and heritable gene silencing."

        "abstract": "In plants, RNA silencing can be induced by highly transcribed sense transgenes (S-PTGS) or by transgene loci producing double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) due to the presence of inverted repeats (IR-PTGS). Both phenomena correlate with accumulation of 21-25 nt sense and anti-sense RNA homologous to the silent gene and with methylation of the coding sequence. We have challenged IR-PTGS with four viruses known to inhibit S-PTGS: CMV, TuMV, TVCV, and TCV ( this work) and in sgs2, sgs3, and ago1 mutants impaired in S-PTGS. Surprisingly, whereas the four viruses inhibit IR-PTGS, IR-PTGS and methylation of a GUS trangene and IR-PTGS of three endogeneous genes occur in the sgs2, sgs3, and ago1 mutations. Based on these results, we propose a branched pathway for RNA silencing in plants. RNA silencing would occur via the action of dsRNA produced either via the action of SGS2 (also known as SDE1), SGS3, and AGO1 on the S-PTGS branch or by transgenes arranged as inverted repeats on the IR-PTGS branch. Moreover, transgene methylation would result from production or action of dsRNA, since it does not require SGS2/SDE1, SGS3, and AGO1."

        "abstract": "RNA silencing is a sequence-specific RNA degradation process that follows the recognition of double-stranded RNA. Here, we show that virus vectors carrying parts of a green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgene targeted RNA silencing in Nicotiana benthamiana and Arabidopsis against the entire GFP RNA. These results indicate that there was spreading of RNA targeting from the initiator region into the adjacent 5' and 3' regions of the target gene. Spreading was accompanied by methylation of the corresponding GFP DNA. It also was dependent on transcription of the transgene and on the putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, SDE1/SGS2. These findings indicate that SDE1/SGS2 produces double-stranded RNA using the target RNA as a template. RNA silencing of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase and phytoene desaturase was not associated with the spreading of RNA targeting or DNA methylation, indicating that these endogenous RNAs are not templates for SDE1/SGS2."

Using Cox regression and risk-score analysis, we identified a five-microRNA signature for the prediction of treatment outcome of NSCLC in the training set. This microRNA signature was validated by the testing set and an independent cohort. Patients with high-risk scores in their microRNA signatures had poor overall and disease-free survivals compared to the low-risk-score patients. This microRNA signature is an independent predictor of the cancer relapse and survival of NSCLC patients."

        "title": "In vitro reconstitution of the human RISC-loading complex.",
        "abstract": "Targeted gene silencing by RNAi requires the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), whose core component is the protein Argonaute (Ago) bound to a microRNA (miRNA) or an siRNA. In humans, Ago2 is loaded with miRNAs by the action of a specialized assembly called the RISC-loading complex (RLC), comprising the proteins Ago2, Dicer, and TRBP. Here we show that the human RLC assembles spontaneously in vitro from purified components. No cofactors or chaperones are required for the complex to form. The reconstituted RLC, containing one copy of each protein, has the dicing, slicing, guide-strand selection, and Ago2-loading activities observed for the endogenous RLC. Furthermore, once Ago2 is loaded with an miRNA, it tends to dissociate from the rest of the complex. These results lay the groundwork for future structural and functional dissection of RISC loading in humans."

        "title": "Endogenous human microRNAs that suppress breast cancer metastasis.",
        "abstract": "A search for general regulators of cancer metastasis has yielded a set of microRNAs for which expression is specifically lost as human breast cancer cells develop metastatic potential. Here we show that restoring the expression of these microRNAs in malignant cells suppresses lung and bone metastasis by human cancer cells in vivo. Of these microRNAs, miR-126 restoration reduces overall tumour growth and proliferation, whereas miR-335 inhibits metastatic cell invasion. miR-335 regulates a set of genes whose collective expression in a large cohort of human tumours is associated with risk of distal metastasis. miR-335 suppresses metastasis and migration through targeting of the progenitor cell transcription factor SOX4 and extracellular matrix component tenascin C. Expression of miR-126 and miR-335 is lost in the majority of primary breast tumours from patients who relapse, and the loss of expression of either microRNA is associated with poor distal metastasis-free survival. miR-335 and miR-126 are thus identified as metastasis suppressor microRNAs in human breast cancer."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNAs of 19 to 25 nucleotides that are negative regulators of gene expression. To determine whether miRNAs are associated with cytogenetic abnormalities and clinical features in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we evaluated the miRNA expression of CD34(+) cells and 122 untreated adult AML cases using a microarray platform. After background subtraction and normalization using a set of housekeeping genes, data were analyzed using Significance Analysis of Microarrays. An independent set of 60 untreated AML patients was used to validate the outcome signatures using real-time polymerase chain reaction. We identified several miRNAs differentially expressed between CD34(+) normal cells and the AML samples. miRNA expression was also closely associated with selected cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities, such as t(11q23), isolated trisomy 8, and FLT3-ITD mutations. Furthermore, patients with high expression of miR-191 and miR-199a had significantly worse overall and event-free survival than AML patients with low expression (overall survival: miR-191, P = .03; and miR-199a, P = .001, Cox regression). In conclusion, miRNA expression in AML is closely associated with cytogenetics and FLT3-ITD mutations. A small subset of miRNAs is correlated with survival."

Many of these sRNAs remain to be validated and functionally characterized. Recent advances in microRNA (miRNA)-expression profiling of different tissues, stages of development and physiological or pathological states are beginning to be explored using several technological approaches. In this review, these recent advances in miRNA microarray technology and their applications, particularly in basic research and clinical diagnosis, will be summarized and discussed. The methods for miRNA enrichment and probe design and labeling will also be discussed with an emphasis on evaluation of predicted miRNA sequences, analysis of miRNA expression and exploration of the potential roles of miRNA sequences in the regulation of stem cell differentiation and tissue- and time-specific profiling patterns of their target genes."

Whereas mRNA-analysis has become a well established technique in many forensic laboratories, micro-RNA has only recently been introduced to forensic science. Herein we provide a short outline of biogenesis, mode of function and regulation of miRNAs and take a look at tissue and cell specific miRNA expression. After recapitulating the role of mRNA analysis in forensic science we compare it to miRNA analysis and discuss the results of two recent studies applying miRNA analysis to a forensic research setting. We conclude that analysis of miRNA and perhaps small non-coding RNAs in general clearly has potential for forensic applications and merits attention of forensic scientists."

        "title": "The miR-15/107 group of microRNA genes: evolutionary biology, cellular functions, and roles in human diseases.",
        "abstract": "The miR-15/107 group of microRNA (miRNA) gene is increasingly appreciated to serve key functions in humans. These miRNAs regulate gene expression involved in cell division, metabolism, stress response, and angiogenesis in vertebrate species. The miR-15/107 group has also been implicated in human cancers, cardiovascular disease and neurodegenerative disease, including Alzheimer's disease. Here we provide an overview of the following: (1) the evolution of miR-15/107 group member genes; (2) the expression levels of miRNAs in mammalian tissues; (3) evidence for overlapping gene-regulatory functions by different miRNAs; (4) the normal biochemical pathways regulated by miR-15/107 group miRNAs; and (5) the roles played by these miRNAs in human diseases. Membership in this group is defined based on sequence similarity near the mature miRNAs' 5' end: all include the sequence AGCAGC. Phylogeny of this group of miRNAs is incomplete; thus, a definitive taxonomic classification (e.g., designation as a \"superfamily\") is currently not possible. While all vertebrates studied to date express miR-15a, miR-15b, miR-16, miR-103, and miR-107, mammals alone are known to express miR-195, miR-424, miR-497, miR-503, and miR-646. Multiple different miRNAs in the miR-15/107 group are expressed at moderate to high levels in human tissues. We present data on the expression of all known miR-15/107 group members in human cerebral cortical gray matter and white matter using new miRNA profiling microarrays. There is extensive overlap in the mRNAs targeted by miR-15/107 group members. We show new data from cultured H4 cancer cells that demonstrate similarities in mRNAs targeted by miR-16 and miR-103 and also support the importance of the mature miRNAs' 5' seed region in mRNA target recognition. In conclusion, the miR-15/107 group of miRNA genes is a fascinating topic of study for evolutionary biologists, miRNA biochemists, and clinically oriented translational researchers alike."

Host endogenous small RNAs are essential in this gene expression reprogramming process. Here, we discuss recent findings on pathogen-regulated host microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and their roles in plant-microbe interaction. We further introduce small RNA pathway components, including Dicer-like proteins (DCLs), double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) binding protein, RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RDRs), small RNA methyltransferase HEN1, and Argonaute (AGO) proteins, that contribute to plant immune responses. The strategies that pathogens have evolved to suppress host small RNA pathways are also discussed. Collectively, host small RNAs and RNA silencing machinery constitute a critical layer of defense in regulating the interaction of pathogens with plants."

Here, we show that maturation of miR-451, a functional miRNA that is perfectly conserved among vertebrates, is independent of Dicer. Instead, structure-function and knockdown studies indicate that Drosha generates a short pre-mir-451 hairpin that is directly cleaved by Ago2 and followed by resection of its 3' terminus. We provide stringent evidence for this model by showing that Dicer knockout cells can generate mature miR-451 but not other miRNAs, whereas Ago2 knockout cells reconstituted with wild-type Ago2, but not Slicer-deficient Ago2, can process miR-451. Finally, we show that the mir-451 backbone is amenable to reprogramming, permitting vector-driven expression of diverse functional miRNAs in the absence of Dicer. Beyond the demonstration of an alternative strategy to direct gene silencing, these observations open the way for transgenic rescue of Dicer conditional knockouts."

        "title": "Practical Aspects of microRNA Target Prediction.",
        "abstract": "microRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous non-coding RNAs that control gene expression at the posttranscriptional level. These small regulatory molecules play a key role in the majority of biological processes and their expression is also tightly regulated. Both the deregulation of genes controlled by miRNAs and the altered miRNA expression have been linked to many disorders, including cancer, cardiovascular, metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, it is of particular interest to reliably predict potential miRNA targets which might be involved in these diseases. However, interactions between miRNAs and their targets are complex and very often there are numerous putative miRNA recognition sites in mRNAs. Many miRNA targets have been computationally predicted but only a limited number of these were experimentally validated. Although a variety of miRNA target prediction algorithms are available, results of their application are often inconsistent. Hence, finding a functional miRNA target is still a challenging task. In this review, currently available and frequently used computational tools for miRNA target prediction, i.e., PicTar, TargetScan, DIANA-microT, miRanda, rna22 and PITA are outlined and various practical aspects of miRNA target analysis are extensively discussed. Moreover, the performance of three algorithms (PicTar, TargetScan and DIANA-microT) is both demonstrated and evaluated by performing an in-depth analysis of miRNA interactions with mRNAs derived from genes triggering hereditary neurological disorders known as trinucleotide repeat expansion diseases (TREDs), such as Huntington's disease (HD), a number of spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), and myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1)."

        "title": "SMAD proteins control DROSHA-mediated microRNA maturation.",
        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that participate in the spatiotemporal regulation of messenger RNA and protein synthesis. Aberrant miRNA expression leads to developmental abnormalities and diseases, such as cardiovascular disorders and cancer; however, the stimuli and processes regulating miRNA biogenesis are largely unknown. The transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) family of growth factors orchestrates fundamental biological processes in development and in the homeostasis of adult tissues, including the vasculature. Here we show that induction of a contractile phenotype in human vascular smooth muscle cells by TGF-beta and BMPs is mediated by miR-21. miR-21 downregulates PDCD4 (programmed cell death 4), which in turn acts as a negative regulator of smooth muscle contractile genes. Surprisingly, TGF-beta and BMP signalling promotes a rapid increase in expression of mature miR-21 through a post-transcriptional step, promoting the processing of primary transcripts of miR-21 (pri-miR-21) into precursor miR-21 (pre-miR-21) by the DROSHA (also known as RNASEN) complex. TGF-beta- and BMP-specific SMAD signal transducers are recruited to pri-miR-21 in a complex with the RNA helicase p68 (also known as DDX5), a component of the DROSHA microprocessor complex. The shared cofactor SMAD4 is not required for this process. Thus, regulation of miRNA biogenesis by ligand-specific SMAD proteins is critical for control of the vascular smooth muscle cell phenotype and potentially for SMAD4-independent responses mediated by the TGF-beta and BMP signalling pathways."

Silencing pathways couple the destruction of double-stranded RNA with the use of the resulting small RNAs to target other nucleic acid molecules that contain the complementary sequence. This discovery has revolutionized our ideas about host defense and genetic regulatory mechanisms in eukaryotes. Small RNAs can direct the degradation of mRNAs and single-stranded viral RNAs, the modification of DNA and histones, and the inhibition of translation. Viruses might even use small RNAs to do some targeting of their own to manipulate host gene expression. This review highlights the current understanding and new insights concerning the roles of small RNAs in virus infection and host defense in plants."

        "title": "Role of microRNAs in vascular diseases, inflammation, and angiogenesis.",
        "abstract": "The integrity of the endothelial monolayer is fundamental for the homoeostasis of the vascular system. Functional endothelial cells are also required for the growth of new blood vessels during neovascularization. Although multiple growth factors have been shown to regulate angiogenesis and vascular development, little is known about the complex upstream regulation of gene expression and translation. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an emerging class of highly conserved, non-coding small RNAs that regulate gene expression on the post-transcriptional level by inhibiting the translation of protein from mRNA or by promoting the degradation of mRNA. More than 500 human miRNAs have been identified so far, and increasing evidence indicates that miRNAs have distinct expression profiles and play crucial roles in various physiological and pathological processes such as cardiogenesis, haematopoietic lineage differentiation, and oncogenesis. Meanwhile, a few specific miRNAs that regulate endothelial cell functions and angiogenesis have been described. Let7-f, miR-27b, and mir-130a were identified as pro-angiogenic miRNAs. In contrast, miR-221 and miR-222 inhibit endothelial cell migration, proliferation, and angiogenesis in vitro by targeting the stem cell factor receptor c-kit and indirectly regulating endothelial nitric oxide synthase expression. Moreover, some miRNAs are involved in tumour angiogenesis such as the miR-17-92 cluster and miR-378. Early studies also indicate the contribution of specific miRNAs (e.g. miR-155, miR-21, and miR-126) to vascular inflammation and diseases. Thus, the identification of miRNAs and their respective targets may offer new therapeutic strategies to treat vascular diseases such as atherosclerosis, to improve neovascularization after ischaemia, or to prevent tumour progression."

        "title": "Dual roles of the nuclear cap-binding complex and SERRATE in pre-mRNA splicing and microRNA processing in Arabidopsis thaliana.",
        "abstract": "The processing of Arabidopsis thaliana microRNAs (miRNAs) from longer primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs) requires the activity of several proteins, including DICER-LIKE1 (DCL1), the double-stranded RNA-binding protein HYPONASTIC LEAVES1 (HYL1), and the zinc finger protein SERRATE (SE). It has been noted before that the morphological appearance of weak se mutants is reminiscent of plants with mutations in ABH1/CBP80 and CBP20, which encode the two subunits of the nuclear cap-binding complex. We report that, like SE, the cap-binding complex is necessary for proper processing of pri-miRNAs. Inactivation of either ABH1/CBP80 or CBP20 results in decreased levels of mature miRNAs accompanied by apparent stabilization of pri-miRNAs. Whole-genome tiling array analyses reveal that se, abh1/cbp80, and cbp20 mutants also share similar splicing defects, leading to the accumulation of many partially spliced transcripts. This is unlikely to be an indirect consequence of improper miRNA processing or other mRNA turnover pathways, because introns retained in se, abh1/cbp80, and cbp20 mutants are not affected by mutations in other genes required for miRNA processing or for nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Taken together, our results uncover dual roles in splicing and miRNA processing that distinguish SE and the cap-binding complex from specialized miRNA processing factors such as DCL1 and HYL1."

Studies that overexpress individual miRNAs typically uncover relative subtle inhibition of the predicted targets. Accordingly, most miRNAs expressed in a given cell type may serve the function to broadly inhibit cell-type-inappropriate gene expression and deepen a pre-existing differentiation program. However, recent functional analyses of miRNAs in the immune system reveal that many cellular decisions are controlled by single miRNAs that entail significant downregulation of one or few target proteins. Investigations of these miRNA/mRNA pairs showed that miRNA-adjusted target protein levels are crucial at specific cellular transition points. Here, we will review recent advances in the regulation of the miRNA pathway and discuss how miRNAs control immune functions."

        "abstract": "In plants and several other organisms, the effects of RNA silencing can be amplified by the action of cellular RNA-DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASES (RDRs). These enzymes were primarily studied for their role in antiviral defense in plants, but it is becoming increasingly apparent that they also have important endogenous functions, including the control of chromatin structure and the regulation of cellular gene expression. Recent evidence suggests that endogenous RDR activities intercept several RNA quality control pathways that normally prevent or restrain widespread amplification of silencing, which is likely to be detrimental. Plants appear, however, to have evolved sophisticated measures to tolerate or exploit amplified silencing under specific biological circumstances."

        "abstract": "A hallmark of mammalian embryonic development is the widespread induction of microRNA (miRNA) expression. Surprisingly, the transcription of many of these small, noncoding RNAs is unchanged through development; rather, a post-transcriptional regulatory event prevents accumulation of the mature miRNA species. Here, we present a biochemical framework for the regulated production of the Let-7 family of miRNAs. Embryonic cells contain a Drosha Inhibitor that prevents processing of the Let-7 primary transcript. This inhibitor specifically binds to conserved nucleotides in the loop region of the Let-7 precursor, and competitor RNAs that mimic the binding site restore Let-7 processing. We have identified the Drosha Inhibitor as the embryonic stem cell specific protein Lin-28. Lin-28 has been previously implicated in developmental regulatory pathways in Caenorhabditis elegans, and it promotes reprogramming of human somatic cells into pluripotent stem cells. Our findings outline a microRNA post-transcriptional regulatory network and establish a novel role for the miRNA precursor loop in the regulated production of mature Let-7."

        "title": "Proliferating cells express mRNAs with shortened 3' untranslated regions and fewer microRNA target sites.",
        "abstract": "Messenger RNA (mRNA) stability, localization, and translation are largely determined by sequences in the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR). We found a conserved increase in expression of mRNAs terminating at upstream polyadenylation sites after activation of primary murine CD4+ T lymphocytes. This program, resulting in shorter 3'UTRs, is a characteristic of gene expression during immune cell activation and correlates with proliferation across diverse cell types and tissues. Forced expression of full-length 3'UTRs conferred reduced protein expression. In some cases the reduction in protein expression could be reversed by deletion of predicted microRNA target sites in the variably included region. Our data indicate that gene expression is coordinately regulated, such that states of increased proliferation are associated with widespread reductions in the 3'UTR-based regulatory capacity of mRNAs."

        "abstract": "The Piwi proteins of the Argonaute superfamily are required for normal germline development in Drosophila, zebrafish, and mice and associate with 24-30 nucleotide RNAs termed piRNAs. We identify a class of 21 nucleotide RNAs, previously named 21U-RNAs, as the piRNAs of C. elegans. Piwi and piRNA expression is restricted to the male and female germline and independent of many proteins in other small-RNA pathways, including DCR-1. We show that Piwi is specifically required to silence Tc3, but not other Tc/mariner DNA transposons. Tc3 excision rates in the germline are increased at least 100-fold in piwi mutants as compared to wild-type. We find no evidence for a Ping-Pong model for piRNA amplification in C. elegans. Instead, we demonstrate that Piwi acts upstream of an endogenous siRNA pathway in Tc3 silencing. These data might suggest a link between piRNA and siRNA function."

In this work, we addressed whether in vitro angiogenesis is an miRNA-regulated process. We performed large-scale analysis of miRNA expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and found that 15 highly expressed miRNAs have the receptors of angiogenic factors as putative targets. In particular, we demonstrated that miR-221 and miR-222 affect c-Kit expression and, as a consequence, the angiogenic properties of its ligand stem cell factor. Interaction between miR-222 and c-Kit is likely to be part of a complex circuit that controls the ability of endothelial cells to form new capillaries."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNA molecules playing regulatory roles by repressing translation or cleaving RNA transcripts. Although the number of verified human miRNA is still expanding, only few have been functionally described. However, emerging evidences suggest the potential involvement of altered regulation of miRNA in pathogenesis of cancers and these genes are thought to function as both tumours suppressor and oncogenes. In our study, we examined by Real-Time PCR the expression of 156 mature miRNA in colorectal cancer. The analysis by several bioinformatics algorithms of colorectal tumours and adjacent non-neoplastic tissues from patients and colorectal cancer cell lines allowed identifying a group of 13 miRNA whose expression is significantly altered in this tumor. The most significantly deregulated miRNA being miR-31, miR-96, miR-133b, miR-135b, miR-145, and miR-183. In addition, the expression level of miR-31 was correlated with the stage of CRC tumor. Our results suggest that miRNA expression profile could have relevance to the biological and clinical behavior of colorectal neoplasia."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of regulatory RNAs of approximately 21 nucleotides that posttranscriptionally regulate gene expression by directing mRNA cleavage or translational inhibition. Increasing evidence points to a potential role of miRNAs in diverse physiological processes. miR398 targets two closely related Cu/Zn superoxide dismutases (cytosolic CSD1 and chloroplastic CSD2) that can detoxify superoxide radicals. CSD1 and CSD2 transcripts are induced in response to oxidative stress, but the regulatory mechanism of the induction is unknown. Here, we show that miR398 expression is downregulated transcriptionally by oxidative stresses, and this downregulation is important for posttranscriptional CSD1 and CSD2 mRNA accumulation and oxidative stress tolerance. We also provide evidence for an important role of miR398 in specifying the spatial and temporal expression patterns of CSD1 and CSD2 mRNAs. Our results suggest that CSD1 and CSD2 expression is fine-tuned by miR398-directed mRNA cleavage. Additionally, we show that transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants overexpressing a miR398-resistant form of CSD2 accumulate more CSD2 mRNA than plants overexpressing a regular CSD2 and are consequently much more tolerant to high light, heavy metals, and other oxidative stresses. Thus, relieving miR398-guided suppression of CSD2 in transgenic plants is an effective new approach to improving plant productivity under oxidative stress conditions."

        "title": "The small RNA world of plants.",
        "abstract": "RNA has many functions in addition to being a simple messenger between the genome and the proteome. Over two decades, several classes of small noncoding RNAs c. 21 nucleotides (nt) long have been uncovered in eukaryotic genomes, which appear to play a central role in diverse and fundamental processes. In plants, small RNA-based mechanisms are involved in genome stability, gene expression and defense. Many of the discoveries in this new \"small RNA world\" were made by plant biologists. Here, we discuss the three major classes of small RNAs that are found in the plant kingdom, namely small interfering RNAs, microRNAs, and the recently discovered trans-acting small interfering RNAs. Recent results shed light on the identification, integration and specialization of the different components (Dicer-like, Argonaute, and others) involved in the biogenesis of the different classes of small RNAs in plants. Owing to the development of better experimental and computational methods, an ever increasing number of small noncoding RNAs are uncovered in different plant genomes. In particular the well-studied microRNAs seem to act as key regulators in several different developmental pathways, with a marked preference for transcription factors as targets. In addition, an increasing amount of data suggest that they also play an important role in other mechanisms, such as response to stress or environmental changes."

        "abstract": "Human adenocarcinomas commonly harbor mutations in the KRAS and MYC proto-oncogenes and the TP53 tumor suppressor gene. All three genetic lesions are potentially pro-angiogenic, as they sustain production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Yet Kras-transformed mouse colonocytes lacking p53 formed indolent, poorly vascularized tumors, whereas additional transduction with a Myc-encoding retrovirus promoted vigorous vascularization and growth. In addition, VEGF levels were unaffected by Myc, but enhanced neovascularization correlated with downregulation of anti-angiogenic thrombospondin-1 (Tsp1) and related proteins, such as connective tissue growth factor (CTGF). Both Tsp1 and CTGF are predicted targets for repression by the miR-17-92 microRNA cluster, which was upregulated in colonocytes coexpressing K-Ras and c-Myc. Indeed, miR-17-92 knockdown with antisense 2'-O-methyl oligoribonucleotides partly restored Tsp1 and CTGF expression; in addition, transduction of Ras-only cells with a miR-17-92-encoding retrovirus reduced Tsp1 and CTGF levels. Notably, miR-17-92-transduced cells formed larger, better-perfused tumors. These findings establish a role for microRNAs in non-cell-autonomous Myc-induced tumor phenotypes."

The term encompasses related pathways found in a broad range of eukaryotic organisms, including fungi, plants, and animals. In plants, it serves as an antiviral defense, and many plant viruses encode suppressors of silencing. The emerging view is that RNA silencing is part of a sophisticated network of interconnected pathways for cellular defense, RNA surveillance, and development and that it may become a powerful tool to manipulate gene expression experimentally."

        "abstract": "Drought is a normal and recurring climate feature in most parts of the world and plays a major role in limiting crop productivity. However, plants have their own defence systems to cope with adverse climatic conditions. One of these defence mechanisms is the reprogramming of gene expression by microRNAs (miRNAs). miRNAs are small noncoding RNAs of approximately 22 nucleotides length, which have emerged as important regulators of genes at post-transcriptional levels in a range of organisms. Some miRNAs are functionally conserved across plant species and are regulated by drought stress. These properties suggest that miRNA-based genetic modifications have the potential to enhance drought tolerance in cereal crops. This review summarizes the current understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of plant miRNAs, involvement of plant miRNAs in drought stress responses in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), wheat (Triticum spp.) and other plant species, and the involvement of miRNAs in plant-adaptive mechanisms under drought stress. Potential strategies and directions for future miRNA research and the utilization of miRNAs in the improvement of cereal crops for drought tolerance are also discussed."

        "abstract": "A group of small non-coding RNA molecules, termed microRNAs (miRNAs), have generated considerable interest in recent years due to their central role in a growing number of biologic processes. Serving as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression, miRNAs have also emerged as critical factors in the pathogenesis of many diseases. As a result, they show great potential as accurate diagnostic and prognostic markers, as well as viable therapeutic targets for treating disease. It has been proposed that miRNAs play a significant role in cutaneous wound repair and that aberrant miRNA expression may result in disorganized or poor healing. Specific patterns of miRNA expression have been identified in wound healing models. miRNAs are important regulators of leucocyte function and the cytokine network, and are necessary for endothelial cell migration and capillary formation. These molecules also control proliferation and differentiation of wound-specific cells and can determine extracellular matrix composition. This article reviews the evidence for miRNA regulation of inflammation, angiogenesis, fibroblast function, keratinocyte function, and apoptosis, which are essential components for effective wound repair. The future potential for improving wound healing outcomes using miRNA-based therapies is also discussed."

        "abstract": "We recently found that hnRNP A1, a protein implicated in many aspects of RNA processing, acts as an auxiliary factor for the Drosha-mediated processing of a microRNA precursor, pri-miR-18a. Here, we provide the mechanism by which hnRNP A1 regulates this event. We show that hnRNP A1 binds to the loop of pri-miR-18a and induces a relaxation at the stem, creating a more favorable cleavage site for Drosha. We found that approximately 14% of all pri-miRNAs have highly conserved loops, which we predict act as landing pads for trans-acting factors influencing miRNA processing. In agreement, we show that 2'O-methyl oligonucleotides targeting conserved loops (LooptomiRs) abolish miRNA processing in vitro. Furthermore, we present evidence to support an essential role of conserved loops for pri-miRNA processing. Altogether, these data suggest the existence of auxiliary factors for the processing of specific miRNAs, revealing an additional level of complexity for the regulation of miRNA biogenesis."

Much progress has been made in computational target prediction of miRNAs in recent years. More than 10 miRNA target prediction programs have been established, yet, the prediction of animal miRNA targets remains a challenging task. We have developed miRecords, an integrated resource for animal miRNA-target interactions. The Validated Targets component of this resource hosts a large, high-quality manually curated database of experimentally validated miRNA-target interactions with systematic documentation of experimental support for each interaction. The current release of this database includes 1135 records of validated miRNA-target interactions between 301 miRNAs and 902 target genes in seven animal species. The Predicted Targets component of miRecords stores predicted miRNA targets produced by 11 established miRNA target prediction programs. miRecords is expected to serve as a useful resource not only for experimental miRNA researchers, but also for informatics scientists developing the next-generation miRNA target prediction programs. The miRecords is available at http://miRecords.umn.edu/miRecords."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that control diverse cellular and developmental events through repression of large sets of target mRNAs. Regulated transcription of the genes encoding miRNAs by RNA polymerase II promotes specific expression patterns of individual miRNAs. However, recent studies have established that substantial regulation of mature miRNA accumulation also occurs after transcription. Here, we review the mechanisms of such post-transcriptional regulation, with a particular focus on examples where molecular mechanisms or physiological principles are beginning to emerge. Elucidating these mechanisms will increase our understanding of gene regulation and provide new insights into causes of miRNA misexpression in diseases such as cancer."

        "abstract": "Despite advances in detection and therapies, breast cancer is still the leading cause of cancer death in women worldwide. The etiology of this neoplasm is complex, and both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the complicated scenario. Gene profiling studies have been extensively used over the past decades as a powerful tool in defining the signature of different cancers and in predicting outcome and response to therapies. More recently, a new class of small non-coding RNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs), able to regulate gene expression binding seed sequences on the 3'UTR of mRNA targets, has been linked to several human diseases, including cancer. An increasing amount of experimental evidence shows that miRNAs are aberrantly expressed in different tumour types, and that they can have a causal role in tumourigenesis. Here, we describe and discuss the evidence supporting the association between miRNAs and breast cancer, underlining their role in the development of this neoplasia, and the impact on putative innovative therapeutical approaches."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a large family of endogenous noncoding RNAs that, together with the Argonaute family of proteins (AGOs), silence the expression of complementary mRNA targets posttranscriptionally. Perfectly complementary targets are cleaved within the base-paired region by catalytically active AGOs. In the case of partially complementary targets, however, AGOs are insufficient for silencing and need to recruit a protein of the GW182 family. GW182 proteins induce translational repression, mRNA deadenylation and exonucleolytic target degradation. Recent work has revealed a direct molecular link between GW182 proteins and cellular deadenylase complexes. These findings shed light on how miRNAs bring about target mRNA degradation and promise to further our understanding of the mechanism of miRNA-mediated repression."

        "title": "Experimental strategies for microRNA target identification.",
        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important regulators of eukaryotic gene expression in most biological processes. They act by guiding the RNAi-induced silencing complex (RISC) to partially complementary sequences in target mRNAs to suppress gene expression by a combination of translation inhibition and mRNA decay. The commonly accepted mechanism of miRNA targeting in animals involves an interaction between the 5'-end of the miRNA called the 'seed region' and the 3' untranslated region (3'-UTR) of the mRNA. Many target prediction algorithms are based around such a model, though increasing evidence demonstrates that targeting can also be mediated through sites other than the 3'-UTR and that seed region base pairing is not always required. The power and validity of such in silico data can be therefore hindered by the simplified rules used to represent targeting interactions. Experimentation is essential to identify genuine miRNA targets, however many experimental modalities exist and their limitations need to be understood. This review summarizes and critiques the existing experimental techniques for miRNA target identification."

        "title": "MicroRNAs as Haematopoiesis Regulators.",
        "abstract": "The production of different types of blood cells including their formation, development, and differentiation is collectively known as haematopoiesis. Blood cells are divided into three lineages erythriod (erythrocytes), lymphoid (B and T cells), and myeloid (granulocytes, megakaryocytes, and macrophages). Haematopoiesis is a complex process regulated by several mechanisms including microRNAs (miRNAs). miRNAs are small RNAs which regulate the expression of a number of genes involved in commitment and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells. Evidence shows that miRNAs play an important role in haematopoiesis; for example, myeloid and erythroid differentiation is blocked by the overexpression of miR-15a. miR-221, miR-222, and miR-24 inhibit the erythropoiesis, whereas miR-150 plays a role in B and T cell differentiation. miR-146 and miR-10a are downregulated in megakaryopoiesis. Aberrant expression of miRNAs was observed in hematological malignancies including chronic myelogenous leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, multiple myelomas, and B cell lymphomas. In this review we have focused on discussing the role of miRNA in haematopoiesis."

        "abstract": "In recent times, microRNA (miRNA) have emerged as primary regulators of fundamental biological processes including cellular differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, as well as synaptic plasticity. However, miRNAs bind their targets with only partial complementarity, making it very challenging to determine exactly how a miRNA is functioning in specific biological environments. This review discusses key principles of miRNA target recognition and function which have emerged through the progressive advancement of biological and bioinformatics approaches. Ultimately, the integration of gene expression and biochemical methods with sequence- and systems-based bioinformatics approaches will reveal profound insights regarding the importance of target contextual features in determining miRNA target recognition and regulatory outcome, as well as the importance of RNA interaction networks in enabling miRNA to regulate different target genes and functions in specific biological contexts. There is therefore a demand for the elegant design of future experiments such that principles of context-specific miRNA target recognition and regulatory outcome can be accurately modeled in normal developmental and disease states."

Biogenesis of miRNAs involves nucleolytic processing of a precursor transcript with extensive foldback structure. Here, we provide evidence that genes encoding miRNAs in plants originated by inverted duplication of target gene sequences. Several recently evolved genes encoding miRNAs in Arabidopsis thaliana and other small RNA-generating loci possess the hallmarks of inverted duplication events that formed the arms on each side of their respective foldback precursors. We propose a model for miRNA evolution that suggests a mechanism for de novo generation of new miRNA genes with unique target specificities."

        "abstract": "A critical step during human microRNA maturation is the processing of the primary microRNA transcript by the nuclear RNaseIII enzyme Drosha to generate the approximately 60-nucleotide precursor microRNA hairpin. How Drosha recognizes primary RNA substrates and selects its cleavage sites has remained a mystery, especially given that the known targets for Drosha processing show no discernable sequence homology. Here, we show that human Drosha selectively cleaves RNA hairpins bearing a large (>/=10 nucleotides) terminal loop. From the junction of the loop and the adjacent stem, Drosha then cleaves approximately two helical RNA turns into the stem to produce the precursor microRNA. Beyond the precursor microRNA cleavage sites, approximately one helix turn of stem extension is also essential for efficient processing. While the sites of Drosha cleavage are determined largely by the distance from the terminal loop, variations in stem structure and sequence around the cleavage site can fine-tune the actual cleavage sites chosen."

The fundamental engines of RNA silencing are RISC and RITS complexes, whose common components are 21-25 nt RNA and an Argonaute protein containing a PIWI domain of unknown function. The crystal structure of an archaeal Piwi protein (AfPiwi) is organised into two domains, one resembling the sugar-binding portion of the lac repressor and another with similarity to RNase H. Invariant residues and a coordinated metal ion lie in a pocket that surrounds the conserved C-terminus of the protein, defining a key functional region in the PIWI domain. Furthermore, two Asp residues, conserved in the majority of Argonaute sequences, align spatially with the catalytic Asp residues of RNase H-like catalytic sites, suggesting that in eukaryotic Argonaute proteins the RNase H-like domain may possess nuclease activity. The conserved region around the C-terminus of the PIWI domain, which is required for small interfering RNA (siRNA) binding to AfPiwi, may function as the receptor site for the obligatory 5' phosphate of siRNAs, thereby specifying the cleavage position of the target mRNA."

        "title": "The Drosha-DGCR8 complex in primary microRNA processing.",
        "abstract": "RNase III proteins play key roles in microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis. The nuclear RNase III Drosha cleaves primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs) to release hairpin-shaped pre-miRNAs that are subsequently cut by the cytoplasmic RNase III Dicer to generate mature miRNAs. While Dicer (class III) and other simple RNase III proteins (class I) have been studied intensively, the class II enzyme Drosha remains to be characterized. Here we dissected the action mechanism of human Drosha by generating mutants and by characterizing its new interacting partner, DGCR8. The basic action mechanism of Drosha was found to be similar to that of human Dicer; the RNase III domains A and B form an intramolecular dimer and cleave the 3' and 5' strands of the stem, respectively. Human Drosha fractionates at approximately 650 kDa, indicating that Drosha functions as a large complex. In this complex, Drosha interacts with DGCR8, which contains two double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-binding domains. By RNAi and biochemical reconstitution, we show that DGCR8 may be an essential component of the pri-miRNA processing complex, along with Drosha. Based on these results, we propose a model for the action mechanism of class II RNase III proteins."

        "title": "MicroRNA expression detected by oligonucleotide microarrays: system establishment and expression profiling in human tissues.",
        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (MIRs) are a novel group of conserved short approximately 22 nucleotide-long RNAs with important roles in regulating gene expression. We have established a MIR-specific oligonucleotide microarray system that enables efficient analysis of the expression of the human MIRs identified so far. We show that the 60-mer oligonucleotide probes on the microarrays hybridize with labeled cRNA of MIRs, but not with their precursor hairpin RNAs, derived from amplified, size-fractionated, total RNA of human origin. Signal intensity is related to the location of the MIR sequences within the 60-mer probes, with location at the 5' region giving the highest signals, and at the 3' end, giving the lowest signals. Accordingly, 60-mer probes harboring one MIR copy at the 5' end gave signals of similar intensity to probes containing two or three MIR copies. Mismatch analysis shows that mutations within the MIR sequence significantly reduce or eliminate the signal, suggesting that the observed signals faithfully reflect the abundance of matching MIRs in the labeled cRNA. Expression profiling of 150 MIRs in five human tissues and in HeLa cells revealed a good overall concordance with previously published results, but also with some differences. We present novel data on MIR expression in thymus, testes, and placenta, and have identified MIRs highly enriched in these tissues. Taken together, these results highlight the increased sensitivity of the DNA microarray over other methods for the detection and study of MIRs, and the immense potential in applying such microarrays for the study of MIRs in health and disease."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) negatively regulate partially complementary target messenger RNAs. Target selection in animals is dictated primarily by sequences at the miRNA 5' end. We demonstrated that despite their small size, specific miRNAs contain additional sequence elements that control their posttranscriptional behavior, including their subcellular localization. We showed that human miR-29b, in contrast to other studied animal miRNAs, is predominantly localized to the nucleus. The distinctive hexanucleotide terminal motif of miR-29b acts as a transferable nuclear localization element that directs nuclear enrichment of miRNAs or small interfering RNAs to which it is attached. Our results indicate that miRNAs sharing common 5' sequences, considered to be largely redundant, might have distinct functions because of the influence of cis-acting regulatory motifs."

        "title": "MicroRNAs regulate the expression of the alternative splicing factor nPTB during muscle development.",
        "abstract": "Alternative pre-mRNA splicing determines many changes in gene expression during development. Two regulators known to control splicing patterns during neuron and muscle differentiation are the polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) and its neuronal homolog nPTB. These proteins repress certain exons in early myoblasts, but upon differentiation of mature myotubes PTB/nPTB expression is reduced, leading to increased inclusion of their target exons. We show here that the repression of nPTB expression during myoblast differentiation results from its targeting by the muscle-restricted microRNA miR-133. During differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts, nPTB protein but not mRNA expression is strongly reduced, concurrent with the up-regulation of miR-133 and the induction of splicing for several PTB-repressed exons. Introduction of synthetic miR-133 into undifferentiated C2C12 cells leads to a decrease in endogenous nPTB expression. Both the miR-133 and the coexpressed miR-1/206 microRNAs are extremely conserved across animal species, and PTB proteins are predicted targets for these miRNAs in Drosophila, mice, and humans. There are two potential miR-133-responsive elements (MRE) within the nPTB 3' untranslated region (UTR), and a luciferase reporter carrying this 3' UTR is repressed by miR-133 in an MRE-dependent manner. Transfection of locked nucleic acid (LNA) oligonucleotides designed to block the function of miR-133 and miR-1/206 increases expression of nPTB and decreases the inclusion of PTB dependent exons. These results indicate that miR-133 directly down-regulates a key splicing factor during muscle development and establishes a role for microRNAs in the control of a developmentally dynamic splicing program."

        "abstract": "Changes in the patterns of gene expression are widely believed to underlie many of the phenotypic differences within and between species. Although much emphasis has been placed on changes in transcriptional regulation, gene expression is regulated at many levels, all of which must ultimately be studied together to obtain a complete picture of the evolution of gene expression. Here we compare the evolution of transcriptional regulation and post-transcriptional regulation that is mediated by microRNAs, a large class of small, non-coding RNAs in plants and animals, focusing on the evolution of the individual regulators and their binding sites. As an initial step towards integrating these mechanisms into a unified framework, we propose a simple model that describes the transcriptional regulation of new microRNA genes."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs are endogenous small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression by interfering with translation or stability of target transcripts. The importance of microRNAs for maintaining biological functions is illustrated by the fact that microRNAs are exploited in nature to regulate phenotypes, and by the diverse disease phenotypes that result when microRNAs are mutated or improperly expressed. Disease-associated microRNAs might therefore represent a new class of therapeutic targets. With the recent demonstration that inhibition of miR-122 reduces viral load in hepatitis C patients, microRNA modulators are no longer merely theoretical, but rather, have become strong candidate therapeutics. The complexity of microRNA biology offers a novel mechanism of action for therapeutic intervention but also poses unique challenges for the development of therapeutic modulators as drugs."

To examine the physiologic effects of an individual miRNA-mRNA interaction in vivo, we generated mice that carry a mutation in the putative microRNA-155 (miR-155) binding site in the 3'-untranslated region of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), designated Aicda(155) mice. AID is required for immunoglobulin gene diversification in B lymphocytes, but it also promotes chromosomal translocations. Aicda(155) caused an increase in steady-state Aicda mRNA and protein amounts by increasing the half-life of the mRNA, resulting in a high degree of Myc-Igh translocations. A similar but more pronounced translocation phenotype was also found in miR-155-deficient mice. Our experiments indicate that miR-155 can act as a tumor suppressor by reducing potentially oncogenic translocations generated by AID."

We studied miRNA deregulation in human epithelial ovarian cancer by integrative genomic approach, including miRNA microarray (n = 106), array-based comparative genomic hybridization (n = 109), cDNA microarray (n = 76), and tissue array (n = 504). miRNA expression is markedly down-regulated in malignant transformation and tumor progression. Genomic copy number loss and epigenetic silencing, respectively, may account for the down-regulation of approximately 15% and at least approximately 36% of miRNAs in advanced ovarian tumors and miRNA down-regulation contributes to a genome-wide transcriptional deregulation. Last, eight miRNAs located in the chromosome 14 miRNA cluster (Dlk1-Gtl2 domain) were identified as potential tumor suppressor genes. Therefore, our results suggest that miRNAs may offer new biomarkers and therapeutic targets in epithelial ovarian cancer."

        "abstract": "microRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that regulate mRNA stability and translation through the action of the RNAi-induced silencing complex (RISC). Our current understanding of miRNA function is inferred largely from studies of the effects of miRNAs on steady-state mRNA levels and from seed match conservation and context in putative targets. Here we have taken a more direct approach to these issues by comprehensively assessing the miRNAs and mRNAs that are physically associated with Argonaute 2 (Ago2), which is a core RISC component. We transfected HEK293T cells with epitope-tagged Ago2, immunopurified Ago2 together with any associated miRNAs and mRNAs, and quantitatively determined the levels of these RNAs by microarray analyses. We found that Ago2 immunopurified samples contained a representative repertoire of the cell's miRNAs and a select subset of the cell's total mRNAs. Transfection of the miRNAs miR-1 and miR-124 caused significant changes in the association of scores of mRNAs with Ago2. The mRNAs whose association with Ago2 increased upon miRNA expression were much more likely to contain specific miRNA seed matches and to have their overall mRNA levels decrease in response to the miRNA transfection than expected by chance. Hundreds of mRNAs were recruited to Ago2 by each miRNA via seed sequences in 3'-untranslated regions and coding sequences and a few mRNAs appear to be targeted via seed sequences in 5'-untranslated regions. Microarray analysis of Ago2 immunopurified samples provides a simple, direct method for experimentally identifying the targets of miRNAs and for elucidating roles of miRNAs in cellular regulation."

        "title": "The Drosophila hairpin RNA pathway generates endogenous short interfering RNAs.",
        "abstract": "In contrast to microRNAs and Piwi-associated RNAs, short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are seemingly dispensable for host-directed gene regulation in Drosophila. This notion is based on the fact that mutants lacking the core siRNA-generating enzyme Dicer-2 or the predominant siRNA effector Argonaute 2 are viable, fertile and of relatively normal morphology. Moreover, endogenous Drosophila siRNAs have not yet been identified. Here we report that siRNAs derived from long hairpin RNA genes (hpRNAs) programme Slicer complexes that can repress endogenous target transcripts. The Drosophila hpRNA pathway is a hybrid mechanism that combines canonical RNA interference factors (Dicer-2, Hen1 (known as CG12367) and Argonaute 2) with a canonical microRNA factor (Loquacious) to generate approximately 21-nucleotide siRNAs. These novel regulatory RNAs reveal unexpected complexity in the sorting of small RNAs, and open a window onto the biological usage of endogenous RNA interference in Drosophila."

        "title": "An endogenous small interfering RNA pathway in Drosophila.",
        "abstract": "Drosophila endogenous small RNAs are categorized according to their mechanisms of biogenesis and the Argonaute protein to which they bind. MicroRNAs are a class of ubiquitously expressed RNAs of approximately 22 nucleotides in length, which arise from structured precursors through the action of Drosha-Pasha and Dicer-1-Loquacious complexes. These join Argonaute-1 to regulate gene expression. A second endogenous small RNA class, the Piwi-interacting RNAs, bind Piwi proteins and suppress transposons. Piwi-interacting RNAs are restricted to the gonad, and at least a subset of these arises by Piwi-catalysed cleavage of single-stranded RNAs. Here we show that Drosophila generates a third small RNA class, endogenous small interfering RNAs, in both gonadal and somatic tissues. Production of these RNAs requires Dicer-2, but a subset depends preferentially on Loquacious rather than the canonical Dicer-2 partner, R2D2 (ref. 14). Endogenous small interfering RNAs arise both from convergent transcription units and from structured genomic loci in a tissue-specific fashion. They predominantly join Argonaute-2 and have the capacity, as a class, to target both protein-coding genes and mobile elements. These observations expand the repertoire of small RNAs in Drosophila, adding a class that blurs distinctions based on known biogenesis mechanisms and functional roles."

        "title": "Drosophila endogenous small RNAs bind to Argonaute 2 in somatic cells.",
        "abstract": "RNA silencing is a conserved mechanism in which small RNAs trigger various forms of sequence-specific gene silencing by guiding Argonaute complexes to target RNAs by means of base pairing. RNA silencing is thought to have evolved as a form of nucleic-acid-based immunity to inactivate viruses and transposable elements. Although the activity of transposable elements in animals has been thought largely to be restricted to the germ line, recent studies have shown that they may also actively transpose in somatic cells, creating somatic mosaicism in animals. In the Drosophila germ line, Piwi-interacting RNAs arise from repetitive intergenic elements including retrotransposons by a Dicer-independent pathway and function through the Piwi subfamily of Argonautes to ensure silencing of retrotransposons. Here we show that, in cultured Drosophila S2 cells, Argonaute 2 (AGO2), an AGO subfamily member of Argonautes, associates with endogenous small RNAs of 20-22 nucleotides in length, which we have collectively named endogenous short interfering RNAs (esiRNAs). esiRNAs can be divided into two groups: one that mainly corresponds to a subset of retrotransposons, and the other that arises from stem-loop structures. esiRNAs are produced in a Dicer-2-dependent manner from distinctive genomic loci, are modified at their 3' ends and can direct AGO2 to cleave target RNAs. Mutations in Dicer-2 caused an increase in retrotransposon transcripts. Together, our findings indicate that different types of small RNAs and Argonautes are used to repress retrotransposons in germline and somatic cells in Drosophila."

        "title": "Endogenous siRNA and miRNA targets identified by sequencing of the Arabidopsis degradome.",
        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate the expression of target mRNAs in plants and animals [1]. Plant miRNA targets have been predicted on the basis of their extensive and often conserved complementarity to the miRNAs [2-4], as well as on miRNA overexpression experiments [5]; many of these target predictions have been confirmed by isolation of the products of miRNA-directed cleavage. Here, we present a transcriptome-wide experimental method, called \"degradome sequencing,\" to directly detect cleaved miRNA targets without relying on predictions or overexpression. The 5' ends of polyadenylated, uncapped mRNAs from Arabidopsis were directly sampled, resulting in an empirical snapshot of the degradome. miRNA-mediated-cleavage products were easily discerned from an extensive background of degraded mRNAs, which collectively covered the majority of the annotated transcriptome. Many previously known Arabidopsis miRNA targets were confirmed, and several novel targets were also discovered. Quantification of cleavage fragments revealed that those derived from TAS transcripts, which are unusual in their production of abundant secondary small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), accumulated to very high levels. A subset of secondary siRNAs are also known to direct cleavage of targets in trans[6]; degradome sequencing revealed many cleaved targets of these trans-acting siRNAs (ta-siRNAs). This empirical method is broadly applicable to the discovery and quantification of cleaved targets of small RNAs without a priori predictions."

MicroRNAs (miRNAs), small non-coding RNAs approximately 22 nucleotides in length, have been reported to be upregulated or downregulated in disease states and specific cell types. Recently, miRNAs have gained recognition as major regulators of human gene expression. MiRNAs can control highly complex signal transduction pathways and other biological pathways by targeting and controlling gene expression, accounting for their important role in lung cancer. Findings from recent studies on the roles of miRNAs in lung cancer are summarized in this review. Understanding miRNA functions in lung cancer will bring molecular-level insight leading to better prognosis, diagnosis, and therapeutic approaches."

        "abstract": "RNA silencing phenomena were first discovered in plants, yet only the RNA interference pathway in animals has been subject to biochemical analysis. Here, we extend biochemical analysis to plant RNA silencing. We find that standard wheat germ extract contains Dicer-like enzymes that convert double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) into two classes of small interfering RNAs, as well as an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity that can convert exogenous single-stranded RNA into dsRNA. In this plant embryo extract, an endogenous microRNA (miRNA) that lacks perfect complementarity to its RNA targets nonetheless acts as a small interfering RNA. The miRNA guides an endonuclease to cleave efficiently wild-type Arabidopsis PHAVOLUTA mRNA, but not a dominant mutant previously shown to perturb leaf development. This finding supports the view that plant miRNAs direct RNAi and that miRNA-specified mRNA destruction is important for proper plant development. Thus, endonuclease complexes guided by small RNAs are a common feature of RNA silencing in both animals and plants."

We cloned ARGONAUTE4 (AGO4) from a screen for mutants that suppress silencing of the Arabidopsis SUPERMAN (SUP) gene. The ago4-1 mutant reactivated silent SUP alleles and decreased CpNpG and asymmetric DNA methylation as well as histone H3 lysine-9 methylation. In addition, ago4-1 blocked histone and DNA methylation and the accumulation of 25-nucleotide small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that correspond to the retroelement AtSN1. These results suggest that AGO4 and long siRNAs direct chromatin modifications, including histone methylation and non-CpG DNA methylation."

        "abstract": "The higher-order assembly of chromatin imposes structural organization on the genetic information of eukaryotes and is thought to be largely determined by posttranslational modification of histone tails. Here, we study a 20-kilobase silent domain at the mating-type region of fission yeast as a model for heterochromatin formation. We find that, although histone H3 methylated at lysine 9 (H3 Lys9) directly recruits heterochromatin protein Swi6/HP1, the critical determinant for H3 Lys9 methylation to spread in cis and to be inherited through mitosis and meiosis is Swi6 itself. We demonstrate that a centromere-homologous repeat (cenH) present at the silent mating-type region is sufficient for heterochromatin formation at an ectopic site, and that its repressive capacity is mediated by components of the RNA interference (RNAi) machinery. Moreover, cenH and the RNAi machinery cooperate to nucleate heterochromatin assembly at the endogenous mat locus but are dispensable for its subsequent inheritance. This work defines sequential requirements for the initiation and propagation of regional heterochromatic domains."

By using affinity-tagged siRNAs, we demonstrate that a single-stranded siRNA resides in the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) together with eIF2C1 and/or eIF2C2 (human GERp95) Argonaute proteins. RISC is rapidly formed in HeLa cell cytoplasmic extract supplemented with 21 nt siRNA duplexes, but also by adding single-stranded antisense RNAs, which range in size between 19 and 29 nucleotides.

        "abstract": "Aberrant micro RNA (miRNA) expression has been described in human malignancies including B-cell lymphomas. We here report BCR-ABL- and c-MYC-dependent regulation of miRNA expression in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) using microarray analysis (miCHIP) and miRNA-specific quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (miR-qRT-PCR). In 3 bcr-abl-positive cell lines, expression of miRNAs encoded within the polycistronic miR-17-92 cluster is specifically down-regulated (2- to 5-fold) by both imatinib treatment and anti-BCR-ABL RNA interference (RNAi). In addition, anti-c-MYC RNAi reduces miR-17-92 expression in K562 cells in which miRNAs can specifically repress reporter gene expression, as demonstrated by specific miRNA inhibition with antagomirs. Furthermore, lentivirus-mediated overexpression of polycistronic miRNAs in K562 cells confers increased proliferation, partial resistance against anti-c-MYC RNAi, and enhanced sensitivity to imatinib-induced cell death. Finally, we determined miR-17-92 expression in purified normal (n = 4), early chronic-phase (CP) (n = 24), and blast-crisis (BC) (n = 7) CML CD34(+) cells and found up-regulation of polycistronic pri-miRNA transcripts in CML and mature miRNAs in CP but not in BC CML. These data are in accordance with a BCR-ABL-c-MYC-miR-17-92 pathway that mediates enhanced miRNA expression in CP but not BC CML CD34(+) cells. Altered miRNA expression may contribute to the pathophysiology of the disease and may provide potential targets for therapeutic intervention."

        "title": "Redundancy and specialization among plant microRNAs: role of the MIR164 family in developmental robustness.",
        "abstract": "In plants, members of microRNA (miRNA) families are often predicted to target the same or overlapping sets of genes. It has thus been hypothesized that these miRNAs may act in a functionally redundant manner. This hypothesis is tested here by studying the effects of elimination of all three members of the MIR164 family from Arabidopsis. It was found that a loss of miR164 activity leads to a severe disruption of shoot development, in contrast to the effect of mutation in any single MIR164 gene. This indicates that these miRNAs are indeed functionally redundant. Differences in the expression patterns of the individual MIR164 genes imply, however, that redundancy among them is not complete, and that these miRNAs show functional specialization. Furthermore, the results of molecular and genetic analyses of miR164-mediated target regulation indicate that miR164 miRNAs function to control the transcript levels, as well as the expression patterns, of their targets, suggesting that they might contribute to developmental robustness. For two of the miR164 targets, namely CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON1 (CUC1) and CUC2, we provide evidence for their involvement in the regulation of growth and show that their derepression in miR164 loss-of-function mutants is likely to account for most of the mutant phenotype."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a recently identified class of epigenetic elements consisting of small noncoding RNAs that bind to the 3' untranslated region of mRNAs and down-regulate their translation to protein. miRNAs play critical roles in many different cellular processes including metabolism, apoptosis, differentiation, and development. We found 33 miRNAs expressed in CD34+ hematopoietic stem-progenitor cells (HSPCs) from normal human bone marrow and mobilized human peripheral blood stem cell harvests. We then combined these data with human HSPC mRNA expression data and with miRNA-mRNA target predictions, into a previously undescribed miRNA:mRNA interaction database called the Transcriptome Interaction Database. The in silico predictions from the Transcriptome Interaction Database pointed to miRNA control of hematopoietic differentiation through translational control of mRNAs critical to hematopoiesis. From these predictions, we formulated a model for miRNA control of stages of hematopoiesis in which many of the genes specifying hematopoietic differentiation are expressed by HSPCs, but are held in check by miRNAs until differentiation occurs. We validated miRNA control of several of these target mRNAs by demonstrating that their translation in fact is decreased by miRNAs. Finally, we chose miRNA-155 for functional characterization in hematopoiesis, because we predicted that it would control both myelopoiesis and erythropoiesis. As predicted, miRNA-155 transduction greatly reduced both myeloid and erythroid colony formation of normal human HSPCs."

        "abstract": "Neuroblastoma (NB) is one of the most common forms of cancer in children, accounting for 15% of pediatric cancer deaths. The clinical course of these tumors is highly variable and is dependent on such factors as age at presentation, stage, ploidy and genomic abnormalities. Hemizygous deletion of chromosome 1p occurs in approximately 30% of advanced stage tumors, is associated with a poor prognosis, and likely leads to the loss of one or more tumor suppressor genes. We show here that microRNA (miRNA)-34a (1p36.23) is generally expressed at lower levels in unfavorable primary NB tumors and cell lines relative to normal adrenal tissue and that reintroduction of this miRNA into three different NB cell lines causes a dramatic reduction in cell proliferation through the induction of a caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway. As a potential mechanistic explanation for this observation, we demonstrate that miR-34a directly targets the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) encoding E2F3 and significantly reduces the levels of E2F3 protein, a potent transcriptional inducer of cell-cycle progression. Furthermore, miR-34a expression increases during retinoic acid-induced differentiation of the SK-N-BE cell line, whereas E2F3 protein levels decrease. Thus, adding to the increasing role of miRNAs in cancer, miR-34a may act as a suppressor of NB tumorgenesis."

        "abstract": "Eukaryotes contain a diversified set of small RNA-guided pathways that control genes, repeated sequences, and viruses at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. Genome-wide profiles and analyses of small RNAs, particularly the large class of 24-nucleotide (nt) short interfering RNAs (siRNAs), were done for wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana and silencing pathway mutants with defects in three RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDR) and four Dicer-like (DCL) genes. The profiling involved direct analysis using a multiplexed, parallel-sequencing strategy. Small RNA-generating loci, especially those producing predominantly 24-nt siRNAs, were found to be highly correlated with repetitive elements across the genome. These were found to be largely RDR2- and DCL3-dependent, although alternative DCL activities were detected on a widespread level in the absence of DCL3. In contrast, no evidence for RDR2-alternative activities was detected. Analysis of RDR2- and DCL3-dependent small RNA accumulation patterns in and around protein-coding genes revealed that upstream gene regulatory sequences systematically lack siRNA-generating activities. Further, expression profiling suggested that relatively few genes, proximal to abundant 24-nt siRNAs, are regulated directly by RDR2- and DCL3-dependent silencing. We conclude that the widespread accumulation patterns for RDR2- and DCL3-dependent siRNAs throughout the Arabidopsis genome largely reflect mechanisms to silence highly repeated sequences."

        "abstract": "In plants, microRNAs (miRNAs) comprise one of two classes of small RNAs that function primarily as negative regulators at the posttranscriptional level. Several MIRNA genes in the plant kingdom are ancient, with conservation extending between angiosperms and the mosses, whereas many others are more recently evolved. Here, we use deep sequencing and computational methods to identify, profile and analyze non-conserved MIRNA genes in Arabidopsis thaliana. 48 non-conserved MIRNA families, nearly all of which were represented by single genes, were identified. Sequence similarity analyses of miRNA precursor foldback arms revealed evidence for recent evolutionary origin of 16 MIRNA loci through inverted duplication events from protein-coding gene sequences. Interestingly, these recently evolved MIRNA genes have taken distinct paths. Whereas some non-conserved miRNAs interact with and regulate target transcripts from gene families that donated parental sequences, others have drifted to the point of non-interaction with parental gene family transcripts. Some young MIRNA loci clearly originated from one gene family but form miRNAs that target transcripts in another family. We suggest that MIRNA genes are undergoing relatively frequent birth and death, with only a subset being stabilized by integration into regulatory networks."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are critical regulators of gene expression. As miRNAs are frequently deregulated in many human diseases, including cancer and immunological disorders, it is important to understand their biological functions. Typically, miRNA-encoding genes are transcribed by RNA Polymerase II and generate primary transcripts that are processed by RNase III-endonucleases DROSHA and DICER into small RNAs of approximately 21 nucleotides. All miRNAs are loaded into Argonaute proteins in the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and act as post-transcriptional regulators by binding to the 3'- untranslated region (UTR) of mRNAs. This seed-dependent miRNA binding inhibits the translation and/or promotes the degradation of mRNA targets. Surprisingly, recent data presents evidence for a target-mediated decay mechanism that controls the level of specific miRNAs. In addition, several non-canonical miRNA-containing genes have been recently described and unexpected functions of miRNAs have been identified. For instance, several miRNAs are located in the nucleus, where they are involved in the transcriptional activation or silencing of target genes. These epigenetic modifiers are recruited by RISC and guided by miRNAs to specific loci in the genome. Here, we will review non-canonical aspects of miRNA biology, including novel regulators of miRNA expression and functions of miRNAs in the nucleus."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are genomically encoded small RNAs used by organisms to regulate the expression of proteins generated from messenger RNA transcripts. The in vivo requirement of specific miRNAs in mammals through targeted deletion remains unknown, and reliable prediction of mRNA targets is still problematic. Here, we show that miRNA biogenesis in the mouse heart is essential for cardiogenesis. Furthermore, targeted deletion of the muscle-specific miRNA, miR-1-2, revealed numerous functions in the heart, including regulation of cardiac morphogenesis, electrical conduction, and cell-cycle control. Analyses of miR-1 complementary sequences in mRNAs upregulated upon miR-1-2 deletion revealed an enrichment of miR-1 \"seed matches\" and a strong tendency for potential miR-1 binding sites to be located in physically accessible regions. These findings indicate that subtle alteration of miRNA dosage can have profound consequences in mammals and demonstrate the utility of mammalian loss-of-function models in revealing physiologic miRNA targets."

        "abstract": "Posttranscriptional RNA silencing of many endogenous transcripts, viruses, and transgenes involves the RNA-DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASE6/DICER-LIKE4 (RDR6/DCL4)-dependent short interfering RNA (siRNA) biogenesis pathway. Arabidopsis thaliana contains several families of trans-acting siRNAs (tasiRNAs) that form in 21-nucleotide phased arrays through the RDR6/DCL4-dependent pathway and that negatively regulate target transcripts. Using deep sequencing technology and computational approaches, the phasing patterns of known tasiRNAs and tasiRNA-like loci from across the Arabidopsis genome were analyzed in wild-type plants and silencing-defective mutants. Several gene transcripts were found to be routed through the RDR6/DCL4-dependent pathway after initial targeting by one or multiple miRNAs or tasiRNAs, the most conspicuous example of which was an expanding clade of genes encoding pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins. Interestingly, phylogenetic analysis using Populus trichocarpa revealed evidence for small RNA-mediated regulatory mechanisms within a similarly expanded group of PPR genes. We suggest that posttranscriptional silencing mechanisms operate on an evolutionary scale to buffer the effects of rapidly expanding gene families."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a new class of small noncoding RNAs that post-transcriptionally regulate the expression of target mRNA transcripts. Many of these target mRNA transcripts are involved in proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis, processes commonly altered during tumorigenesis. Recent work has shown a global decrease of mature miRNA expression in human cancers. However, it is unclear whether this global repression of miRNAs reflects the undifferentiated state of tumors or causally contributes to the transformed phenotype. Here we show that global repression of miRNA maturation promotes cellular transformation and tumorigenesis. Cancer cells expressing short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting three different components of the miRNA processing machinery showed a substantial decrease in steady-state miRNA levels and a more pronounced transformed phenotype. In animals, miRNA processing-impaired cells formed tumors with accelerated kinetics. These tumors were more invasive than control tumors, suggesting that global miRNA loss enhances tumorigenesis. Furthermore, conditional deletion of Dicer1 enhanced tumor development in a K-Ras-induced mouse model of lung cancer. Overall, these studies indicate that abrogation of global miRNA processing promotes tumorigenesis."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that repress protein synthesis by binding to target messenger RNAs. We investigated the effect of target secondary structure on the efficacy of repression by miRNAs. Using structures predicted by the Sfold program, we model the interaction between an miRNA and a target as a two-step hybridization reaction: nucleation at an accessible target site followed by hybrid elongation to disrupt local target secondary structure and form the complete miRNA-target duplex. This model accurately accounts for the sensitivity to repression by let-7 of various mutant forms of the Caenorhabditis elegans lin-41 3' untranslated region and for other experimentally tested miRNA-target interactions in C. elegans and Drosophila melanogaster. These findings indicate a potent effect of target structure on target recognition by miRNAs and establish a structure-based framework for genome-wide identification of animal miRNA targets."

        "abstract": "MiroRNAs (miRNAs) are double-stranded, noncoding RNA molecules (with an average size of 22bp) that serve as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression in higher eukaryotes. miRNAs play an important role in development and other cellular processes by hybridizing with complementary target mRNA transcripts, preventing their translation and thereby destabilizing the target transcripts. Though hundreds of miRNAs have been discovered in a variety of organisms, little is known about their cellular function. They have been implicated in the regulation of developmental timing and pattern formation, restriction of differentiation potential, regulation of insulin secretion, resistance to viral infection, and in genomic rearrangements associated with carcinogenesis or other genetic disorders, such as fragile X syndrome. Recent evidence suggests that the number of unique miRNA genes in humans exceeds 1000, and may be as high as 20,000. It is estimated that 20-30% of all human mRNAs are miRNA targets. During the last few years, special attention has been given to miRNAs as candidate drug targets for cancer, diabetes mellitus, obesity, and viral diseases."

After the discovery of the first miRNA in the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans, these short regulatory RNAs have been found to be an abundant class of RNAs in plants, animals, and DNA viruses. About 3% of human genes encode for miRNAs, and up to 30% of human protein coding genes may be regulated by miRNAs. MicroRNAs play a key role in diverse biological processes, including development, cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Accordingly, altered miRNA expression is likely to contribute to human disease, including cancer. This review will summarize the emerging knowledge of the connections between human miRNA biology and different aspects of carcinogenesis. Various techniques available to investigate miRNAs will also be discussed."

        "abstract": "Neuronal gene expression is tightly regulated in developing CNS. Here, we demonstrate the anti-neural function of phosphatase SCP1 (small C-terminal domain phosphatase 1) during development. We further show that the neuron-enriched microRNA miR-124 directly targets SCP1-3' untranslated region (UTR) to suppress SCP1 expression. In developing spinal cord, expression of miR-124 and SCP1 is complementary, and miR-124 antagonism phenocopies SCP1 overexpression and vice versa. In P19 cells, miR-124 suppresses SCP1 expression and induces neurogenesis, and SCP1 counteracts this proneural activity of miR-124. Our results suggest that, during CNS development, timely down-regulation of SCP1 is critical for inducing neurogenesis, and miR-124 contributes to this process at least in part by down-regulating SCP1 expression."

        "abstract": "Cellular expression of Mcl-1, an anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member, is tightly regulated. Recently, Bcl-2 expression was shown to be regulated by microRNAs, small endogenous RNA molecules that regulate protein expression through sequence-specific interaction with messenger RNA. By analogy, we reasoned that Mcl-1 expression may also be regulated by microRNAs. We chose human immortalized, but non-malignant, H69 cholangiocyte and malignant KMCH cholangiocarcinoma cell lines for these studies, because Mcl-1 is dysregulated in cells with the malignant phenotype. By in silico analysis, we identified a putative target site in the Mcl-1 mRNA for the mir-29 family, and found that mir-29b was highly expressed in cholangiocytes. Interestingly, mir-29b was downregulated in malignant cells, consistent with Mcl-1 protein upregulation. Enforced mir-29b expression reduced Mcl-1 protein expression in KMCH cells. This effect was direct, as mir-29b negatively regulated the expression of an Mcl-1 3' untranslated region (UTR)-based reporter construct. Enforced mir-29b expression reduced Mcl-1 cellular protein levels and sensitized the cancer cells to tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) cytotoxicity. Transfection of non-malignant cells (that express high levels of mir-29) with a locked-nucleic acid antagonist of mir-29b increased Mcl-1 levels and reduced TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. Thus mir-29 is an endogenous regulator of Mcl-1 protein expression, and thereby, apoptosis."

        "title": "MicroRNAs and cancer.",
        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a recently discovered group of small RNA molecules involved in the regulation of gene expression. Analogously to mRNAs, the non-protein-encoding pri-miRNAs are synthesized by RNA polymerase II and post-transcriptionally modified by addition of a 5'-cap and a 3'-poly (A) tail. Subsequently, the pri-miRNA undergoes a number of processing steps in the nucleus and cytoplasm, and ends up as a mature approximately 22 nt miRNA, which can exert its function by binding to the 3'-untranslated region of a subset of mRNAs. Binding of the miRNA to the mRNA results in a reduced translation rate and/or increased degradation of the mRNA. In this way a large number of cellular pathways, such as cellular proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, are regulated by mi-RNAs. As corruption of these pathways is the hallmark of many cancers, dysregulation of miRNA biogenesis or expression levels may lead to tumorigenesis. The mechanisms that alter the expression of miRNAs are similar to those that change the expression levels of mRNAs of tumor suppressor- and oncogenes, i.e. gross genomic aberrations, epigenetic changes, and minor mutations affecting the expression level, processing, or target-interaction potential of the miRNA. Furthermore, expression profiling of miRNAs has been found to be useful for classification of different tumor types. Taken together, miRNAs can be classified as onco-miRs or tumor suppressor-miRs, and may turn out to be potential targets for cancer therapy."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression for diverse functions, but only a limited number of mRNA targets have been experimentally identified. We show that GW182 family proteins AIN-1 and AIN-2 act redundantly to regulate the expression of miRNA targets, but not miRNA biogenesis. Immunoprecipitation (IP) and mass spectrometry indicate that AIN-1 and AIN-2 interact only with miRNA-specific Argonaute proteins ALG-1 and ALG-2 and with components of the core translational initiation complex. Known miRNA targets are enriched in AIN-2 complexes, correlating with the expression of corresponding miRNAs. Combining IP with pyrosequencing and microarray analysis of RNAs associated with AIN-1/AIN-2, we identified 106 previously annotated miRNAs plus nine new candidate miRNAs, but nearly no siRNAs, and more than 3500 potential miRNA targets, including nearly all known ones. Our results demonstrate an effective biochemical approach to systematically identify miRNA targets and provide valuable insights regarding the properties of miRNA effector complexes."

        "abstract": "Identifying the downstream targets of microRNAs (miRNAs) is essential to understanding cellular regulatory networks. We devised a direct biochemical method for miRNA target discovery that combined RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) purification with microarray analysis of bound mRNAs. Because targets of miR-124a have been analyzed, we chose it as our model. We honed our approach both by examining the determinants of stable binding between RISC and synthetic target RNAs in vitro and by determining the dependency of both repression and RISC coimmunoprecipitation on miR-124a seed sites in two of its well characterized targets in vivo. Examining the complete spectrum of miR-124 targets in 293 cells yielded both a set that were down-regulated at the mRNA level, as previously observed, and a set whose mRNA levels were unaffected by miR-124a. Reporter assays validated both classes, extending the spectrum of mRNA targets that can be experimentally linked to the miRNA pathway."

        "abstract": "AU-rich elements (AREs) and microRNA target sites are conserved sequences in messenger RNA (mRNA) 3' untranslated regions (3'UTRs) that control gene expression posttranscriptionally. Upon cell cycle arrest, the ARE in tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) mRNA is transformed into a translation activation signal, recruiting Argonaute (AGO) and fragile X mental retardation-related protein 1 (FXR1), factors associated with micro-ribonucleoproteins (microRNPs). We show that human microRNA miR369-3 directs association of these proteins with the AREs to activate translation. Furthermore, we document that two well-studied microRNAs-Let-7 and the synthetic microRNA miRcxcr4-likewise induce translation up-regulation of target mRNAs on cell cycle arrest, yet they repress translation in proliferating cells. Thus, activation is a common function of microRNPs on cell cycle arrest. We propose that translation regulation by microRNPs oscillates between repression and activation during the cell cycle."

In different experimental model systems, microRNAs (miRNAs) - a class of small, endogenous, noncoding RNAs that control the translation and stability of many mRNAs - are emerging as important regulators of various aspects of neuronal development. Further dissection of the in vivo physiological functions of individual miRNAs promises to offer novel mechanistic insights into the gene regulatory networks that ensure the precise assembly of a functional nervous system."

        "abstract": "Piwi proteins specify an animal-specific subclass of the Argonaute family that, in vertebrates, is specifically expressed in germ cells. We demonstrate that zebrafish Piwi (Ziwi) is expressed in both the male and the female gonad and is a component of a germline-specifying structure called nuage. Loss of Ziwi function results in a progressive loss of germ cells due to apoptosis during larval development. In animals that have reduced Ziwi function, germ cells are maintained but display abnormal levels of apoptosis in adults. In mammals, Piwi proteins associate with approximately 29-nucleotide-long, testis-specific RNA molecules called piRNAs. Here we show that zebrafish piRNAs are present in both ovary and testis. Many of these are derived from transposons, implicating a role for piRNAs in the silencing of repetitive elements in vertebrates. Furthermore, we show that piRNAs are Dicer independent and that their 3' end likely carries a 2'O-Methyl modification."

Here we show the intrinsic requirement for miR-155 in B cell responses to thymus-dependent and -independent antigens. B cells lacking miR-155 generated reduced extrafollicular and germinal center responses and failed to produce high-affinity IgG1 antibodies. Gene-expression profiling of activated B cells indicated that miR-155 regulates an array of genes with diverse function, many of which are predicted targets of miR-155. The transcription factor Pu.1 is validated as a direct target of miR155-mediated inhibition. When Pu.1 is overexpressed in wild-type B cells, fewer IgG1 cells are produced, indicating that loss of Pu.1 regulation is a contributing factor to the miR-155-deficient phenotype. Our results implicate post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression for establishing the terminal differentiation program of B cells."

Currently > 400 microRNAs have been experimentally identified in mammalian genomes, whereas estimates go up to 1000 and beyond. Here we show that many more mammalian microRNAs exist. We discovered novel microRNA candidates using two approaches: testing of computationally predicted microRNAs by a modified microarray-based detection system, and cloning and sequencing of large numbers of small RNAs from different human and mouse tissues. Together these efforts experimentally identified 348 novel mouse and 81 novel human microRNA candidate genes. Most novel microRNAs candidates are not conserved beyond mammals, and ~10% are taxon-specific. Our analyses indicate that the entire microRNA repertoire is not remotely exhausted."

        "abstract": "The Arabidopsis genome contains a highly complex and abundant population of small RNAs, and many of the endogenous siRNAs are dependent on RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase 2 (RDR2) for their biogenesis. By analyzing an rdr2 loss-of-function mutant using two different parallel sequencing technologies, MPSS and 454, we characterized the complement of miRNAs expressed in Arabidopsis inflorescence to considerable depth. Nearly all known miRNAs were enriched in this mutant and we identified 13 new miRNAs, all of which were relatively low abundance and constitute new families. Trans-acting siRNAs (ta-siRNAs) were even more highly enriched. Computational and gel blot analyses suggested that the minimal number of miRNAs in Arabidopsis is approximately 155. The size profile of small RNAs in rdr2 reflected enrichment of 21-nt miRNAs and other classes of siRNAs like ta-siRNAs, and a significant reduction in 24-nt heterochromatic siRNAs. Other classes of small RNAs were found to be RDR2-independent, particularly those derived from long inverted repeats and a subset of tandem repeats. The small RNA populations in other Arabidopsis small RNA biogenesis mutants were also examined; a dcl2/3/4 triple mutant showed a similar pattern to rdr2, whereas dcl1-7 and rdr6 showed reductions in miRNAs and ta-siRNAs consistent with their activities in the biogenesis of these types of small RNAs. Deep sequencing of mutants provides a genetic approach for the dissection and characterization of diverse small RNA populations and the identification of low abundance miRNAs."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, nonprotein-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression. Although hundreds of human miRNA genes have been discovered, the functions of most of these are unknown. Computational predictions indicate that miRNAs, which account for at least 1% of human protein-coding genes, regulate protein production for thousands of or possibly all of human genes. We discuss the functions of mammalian miRNAs and the experimental and computational methods used to detect and predict human miRNA target genes. Anticipating their impact on genome-wide discovery of miRNA targets, we describe the various computational tools and web-based resources available to predict miRNA targets."

This chapter focuses on the methods and strategies for dissecting miRNA function during hematopoietic lineage differentiation. We describe a modified miRNA cloning method and expression analysis approach for determining miRNA expression during hematopoietic lineage differentiation. We illustrate a retroviral vector and a general strategy for the ectopic expression of miRNAs in hemato-poietic stem/progenitor cells. We discuss in vitro and in vivo functional assays that can be used to examine the roles of miRNAs during hematopoietic lineage differentiation. The methods and principles described here should also be applicable to study the roles of miRNAs in the differentiation and function of nonhematopoietic cell types."

        "title": "Characterization of DGCR8/Pasha, the essential cofactor for Drosha in primary miRNA processing.",
        "abstract": "DGCR8/Pasha is an essential cofactor for Drosha, a nuclear RNase III that cleaves the local hairpin structures embedded in long primary microRNA transcripts (pri-miRNAs) in eukaryotes. Although our knowledge of pri-miRNA processing has significantly advanced in recent years, the precise role of DGCR8 in this pathway remains unclear. In our present study, we dissect the domains in DGCR8 that contribute to the processing of pri-miRNAs and the subcellular localization of DGCR8. Drosha is stabilized through an interaction between its middle domain and the conserved C-terminal domain of DGCR8. Furthermore, DGCR8, but not Drosha, can directly and stably interact with pri-miRNAs, and the tandem dsRNA-binding domains (dsRBDs) in DGCR8 are responsible for this recognition. Moreover, the DGCR8 N-terminal region upstream of its dsRBDs is unnecessary for pri-miRNA processing but is critical for nuclear localization. Our study thus provides further insights into the mechanism of action of the Drosha-DGCR8 complex in pri-miRNA processing."

        "abstract": "RNA interference and the microRNA (miRNA) pathway can induce sequence-specific mRNA degradation and/or translational repression. The human genome encodes hundreds of miRNAs that can post-transcriptionally repress thousands of genes. Using reporter constructs, we observed that degradation of mRNAs bearing sites imperfectly complementary to the endogenous let-7 miRNA is considerably stronger in human HEK293 than HeLa cells. The degradation did not result from the Ago2-mediated endonucleolytic cleavage but it was Dicer- and Ago2-dependent. We used this feature of HEK293 to address the size of a pool of transcripts regulated by RNA silencing in a single cell type. We generated HEK293 cell lines depleted of Dicer or individual Ago proteins. The cell lines were used for microarray analyses to obtain a comprehensive picture of RNA silencing. The 3'-untranslated region sequences of a few hundred transcripts that were commonly up-regulated upon Ago2 and Dicer knock-downs showed a significant enrichment of putative miRNA-binding sites. The up-regulation upon Ago2 and Dicer knock-downs was moderate and we found no evidence, at the mRNA level, for activation of silenced genes. Taken together, our data suggest that, independent of the effect on translation, miRNAs affect levels of a few hundred mRNAs in HEK293 cells."

Many miRNAs influence plant development by regulating the accumulation of transcripts that encode transcription factors. Mutants defective in miRNA accumulation, such as dcl1, hen1, hyl1 and ago1, have pleiotropic developmental phenotypes. The serrate-1 (se-1) mutant of Arabidopsis also shows a highly pleiotropic phenotype, which overlaps with the phenotypes of mutants defective in miRNA accumulation. Although it has been proposed that SERRATE (SE) functions specifically in miRNA-mediated repression of the leaf polarity genes PHABULOSA and PHAVOLUTA, microarray analysis shows upregulation of many genes known to be the targets of miRNAs in se-1. We show that SE is a general regulator of miRNA levels affecting the processing of primary miRNA to miRNA."

As a large fraction of protein-coding genes are under miRNA control, production of the appropriate level of specific miRNAs at the right time and in the right place is integral to most gene regulatory pathways. MiRNA biogenesis initiates with transcription, followed by multiple processing steps to produce the mature miRNA. Every step of miRNA production is subject to regulation and disruption of these control mechanisms has been linked to numerous human diseases, where the balance between the expression of miRNAs and their targets becomes distorted. Here we review the basic steps of miRNA biogenesis and describe the various factors that control miRNA transcription, processing, and stability in animal cells. The tremendous effort put into producing the appropriate type and level of specific miRNAs underscores the critical role of these small RNAs in gene regulation."

MicroRNAs were first discovered in Caenorhabditis elegans and were shown to be involved in the timed regulation of developmental events. Since their discovery in the 1990s, thousands of potential miRNAs have since been identified in various organisms through small RNA cloning methods and/or computational prediction, and have been shown to play functionally important roles of gene regulation in invertebrates, vertebrates, plants, fungi and viruses. Numerous functions of miRNAs identified in Drosophila melanogaster have demonstrated a great significance of these regulatory molecules.

        "abstract": "MicroRNA (miRNA) are a newly recognized class of small, noncoding RNA molecules that participate in the developmental control of gene expression. We have studied the regulation of a set of highly expressed neural miRNA during mouse brain development. Temporal control is a characteristic of miRNA regulation in C. elegans and Drosophila, and is also prominent in the embryonic brain. We observed significant differences in the onset and magnitude of induction for individual miRNAs. Comparing expression in cultures of embryonic neurons and astrocytes we found marked lineage specificity for each of the miRNA in our study. Two of the most highly expressed miRNA in adult brain were preferentially expressed in neurons (mir-124, mir-128). In contrast, mir-23, a miRNA previously implicated in neural specification, was restricted to astrocytes. mir-26 and mir-29 were more strongly expressed in astrocytes than neurons, others were more evenly distributed (mir-9, mir-125). Lineage specificity was further explored using reporter constructs for two miRNA of particular interest (mir-125 and mir-128). miRNA-mediated suppression of both reporters was observed after transfection of the reporters into neurons but not astrocytes. miRNA were strongly induced during neural differentiation of embryonic stem cells, suggesting the validity of the stem cell model for studying miRNA regulation in neural development."

        "title": "A cellular microRNA mediates antiviral defense in human cells.",
        "abstract": "In eukaryotes, 21- to 24-nucleotide-long RNAs engage in sequence-specific interactions that inhibit gene expression by RNA silencing. This process has regulatory roles involving microRNAs and, in plants and insects, it also forms the basis of a defense mechanism directed by small interfering RNAs that derive from replicative or integrated viral genomes. We show that a cellular microRNA effectively restricts the accumulation of the retrovirus primate foamy virus type 1 (PFV-1) in human cells. PFV-1 also encodes a protein, Tas, that suppresses microRNA-directed functions in mammalian cells and displays cross-kingdom antisilencing activities. Therefore, through fortuitous recognition of foreign nucleic acids, cellular microRNAs have direct antiviral effects in addition to their regulatory functions."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) affect the morphology of flowering plants by the posttranscriptional regulation of genes involved in critical developmental events. Understanding the spatial and temporal dynamics of miRNA activity during development is therefore central for understanding miRNA functions. We describe a microarray suitable for detection of plant miRNAs. Profiling of Arabidopsis thaliana miRNAs during normal development extends previous expression analyses, highlighting differential expression of miRNA families within specific organs and tissue types. Comparison of our miRNA expression data with existing mRNA microarray data provided a global intersection of plant miRNA and mRNA expression profiles and revealed that tissues in which a given miRNA is highly expressed are unlikely to also show high expression of the corresponding targets. Expression profiling was also used in a phylogenetic survey to test the depth of plant miRNA conservation. Of the 23 families of miRNAs tested, expression of 11 was detected in a gymnosperm and eight in a fern, directly demonstrating that many plant miRNAs have remained essentially unchanged since before the emergence of flowering plants. We also describe an empirical strategy for detecting miRNA target genes from unsequenced transcriptomes and show that targets in nonflowering plants as deeply branching as ferns and mosses are homologous to the targets in Arabidopsis. Therefore, several individual miRNA regulatory circuits have ancient origins and have remained intact throughout the evolution and diversification of plants."

        "abstract": "Plants and animals use small RNAs (microRNAs [miRNAs] and siRNAs) as guides for posttranscriptional and epigenetic regulation. In plants, miRNAs and trans-acting (ta) siRNAs form through distinct biogenesis pathways, although they both interact with target transcripts and guide cleavage. An integrated approach to identify targets of Arabidopsis thaliana miRNAs and ta-siRNAs revealed several new classes of small RNA-regulated genes, including conventional genes such as Argonaute2 and an E2-ubiquitin conjugating enzyme. Surprisingly, five ta-siRNA-generating transcripts were identified as targets of miR173 or miR390. Rather than functioning as negative regulators, miR173- and miR390-guided cleavage was shown to set the 21-nucleotide phase for ta-siRNA precursor processing. These data support a model in which miRNA-guided formation of a 5' or 3' terminus within pre-ta-siRNA transcripts, followed by RDR6-dependent formation of dsRNA and Dicer-like processing, yields phased ta-siRNAs that negatively regulate other genes."

To provide a model system to explore the role of Dicer-generated RNAs in the differentiation of mammalian cells in vivo, we have generated a conditional Dicer allele. Deletion of Dicer at an early stage of T cell development compromised the survival of alphabeta lineage cells, whereas the numbers of gammadelta-expressing thymocytes were not affected. In developing thymocytes, Dicer was not required for the maintenance of transcriptional silencing at pericentromeric satellite sequences (constitutive heterochromatin), the maintenance of DNA methylation and X chromosome inactivation in female cells (facultative heterochromatin), and the stable shutdown of a developmentally regulated gene (developmentally regulated gene silencing). Most remarkably, given that one third of mammalian mRNAs are putative miRNA targets, Dicer seems to be dispensable for CD4/8 lineage commitment, a process in which epigenetic regulation of lineage choice has been well documented. Thus, although Dicer seems to be critical for the development of the early embryo, it may have limited impact on the implementation of some lineage-specific gene expression programs."

        "abstract": "Plant and animal microRNAs (miRNAs) are evolutionarily ancient small RNAs, approximately 19-24 nucleotides in length, that are generated by cleavage from larger highly structured precursor molecules. In both plants and animals, miRNAs posttranscriptionally regulate gene expression through interactions with their target mRNAs, and these targets are often genes involved with regulating key developmental events. Despite these similarities, plant and animal miRNAs exert their control in fundamentally different ways. Generally, animal miRNAs repress gene expression by mediating translational attenuation through (multiple) miRNA-binding sites located within the 3' untranslated region of the target gene. In contrast, almost all plant miRNAs regulate their targets by directing mRNA cleavage at single sites in the coding regions. These and other differences suggest that the two systems may have originated independently, possibly as a prerequisite to the development of complex body plans."

We describe a simple, robust, inexpensive assay for quantitative analysis of microRNAs and short-interfering RNAs. The method relies on primer extension conversion of RNA to cDNA by reverse transcription followed by quantitative, real-time PCR. Technical parameters critical to the success of the assay are presented. Measurements of microRNA levels are sensitive, with most assays allowing measurements in the femtomolar range, which corresponds to tens of copies per cell or less. The assay has a high dynamic range and provides linear readout over differences in microRNA concentrations that span 6-7 orders of magnitude. The assay is capable of discriminating between related microRNA family members that differ by subtle sequence differences. We used the method for quantitative analysis of six microRNAs across 12 tissue samples. The data confirm striking variation in the patterns of expression of these noncoding regulatory RNAs."

Two heterochronic genes, let-7 and lin-4, encode microRNAs (miRNAs) that down-regulate a third heterochronic gene lin-41 by binding to complementary sites in its 3'UTR. let-7 and lin-4 are conserved in mammals. Here we report the cloning and sequencing of mammalian lin-41 orthologs. We find that mouse and human lin-41 genes contain predicted conserved complementary sites for let-7 and the lin-4 ortholog, mir-125, in their 3'UTRs. Mouse lin-41 (Mlin-41) is temporally expressed in developing mouse embryos, most dramatically in the limb buds. Mlin-41 is down-regulated during mid-embryogenesis at the time when mouse let-7c and mir-125 RNA levels are up-regulated. Our results suggest that mammalian lin-41 is temporally regulated by miRNAs in order to direct key developmental events such as limb formation."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an abundant class of non-coding RNAs that are believed to be important in many biological processes through regulation of gene expression. The precise molecular function of miRNAs in mammals is largely unknown and a better understanding will require loss-of-function studies in vivo. Here we show that a novel class of chemically engineered oligonucleotides, termed 'antagomirs', are efficient and specific silencers of endogenous miRNAs in mice. Intravenous administration of antagomirs against miR-16, miR-122, miR-192 and miR-194 resulted in a marked reduction of corresponding miRNA levels in liver, lung, kidney, heart, intestine, fat, skin, bone marrow, muscle, ovaries and adrenals. The silencing of endogenous miRNAs by this novel method is specific, efficient and long-lasting. The biological significance of silencing miRNAs with the use of antagomirs was studied for miR-122, an abundant liver-specific miRNA. Gene expression and bioinformatic analysis of messenger RNA from antagomir-treated animals revealed that the 3' untranslated regions of upregulated genes are strongly enriched in miR-122 recognition motifs, whereas downregulated genes are depleted in these motifs. Analysis of the functional annotation of downregulated genes specifically predicted that cholesterol biosynthesis genes would be affected by miR-122, and plasma cholesterol measurements showed reduced levels in antagomir-122-treated mice. Our findings show that antagomirs are powerful tools to silence specific miRNAs in vivo and may represent a therapeutic strategy for silencing miRNAs in disease."

The miRNA, miR132, was identified through a genome-wide screen as a target of the transcription factor, cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB). miR132 is enriched in neurons and, like many neuronal CREB targets, is highly induced by neurotrophins. Expression of miR132 in cortical neurons induced neurite outgrowth. Conversely, inhibition of miR132 function attenuated neuronal outgrowth. We provide evidence that miR132 regulates neuronal morphogenesis by decreasing levels of the GTPase-activating protein, p250GAP. These data reveal that a CREB-regulated miRNA regulates neuronal morphogenesis by responding to extrinsic trophic cues."

        "abstract": "The mRNA-cleavage step of RNA interference is mediated by an endonuclease, Argonaute2 (Ago2), within the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). Ago2 uses one strand of the small interfering (si) RNA duplex as a guide to find messenger RNAs containing complementary sequences and cleaves the phosphodiester backbone at a specific site measured from the guide strand's 5' end. Here, we show that both strands of siRNA get loaded onto Ago2 protein in Drosophila S2 cell extracts. The anti-guide strand behaves as a RISC substrate and is cleaved by Ago2. This cleavage event is important for the removal of the anti-guide strand from Ago2 protein and activation of RISC."

        "abstract": "In the Drosophila and mammalian RNA interference pathways, siRNAs direct the protein Argonaute2 (Ago2) to cleave corresponding mRNA targets, silencing their expression. Ago2 is the catalytic component of the RNAi enzyme complex, RISC. For each siRNA duplex, only one strand, the guide, is assembled into the active RISC; the other strand, the passenger, is destroyed. An ATP-dependent helicase has been proposed first to separate the two siRNA strands, then the resulting single-stranded guide is thought to bind Ago2. Here, we show that Ago2 instead directly receives the double-stranded siRNA from the RISC assembly machinery. Ago2 then cleaves the siRNA passenger strand, thereby liberating the single-stranded guide. For siRNAs, virtually all RISC is assembled through this cleavage-assisted mechanism. In contrast, passenger-strand cleavage is not important for the incorporation of miRNAs that derive from mismatched duplexes."

        "abstract": "RNA interference is implemented through the action of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). Although Argonaute2 has been identified as the catalytic center of RISC, the RISC polypeptide composition and assembly using short interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes has remained elusive. Here we show that RISC is composed of Dicer, the double-stranded RNA binding protein TRBP, and Argonaute2. We demonstrate that this complex can cleave target RNA using precursor microRNA (pre-miRNA) hairpin as the source of siRNA. Although RISC can also utilize duplex siRNA, it displays a nearly 10-fold greater activity using the pre-miRNA Dicer substrate. RISC distinguishes the guide strand of the siRNA from the passenger strand and specifically incorporates the guide strand. Importantly, ATP is not required for miRNA processing, RISC assembly, or multiple rounds of target-RNA cleavage. These results define the composition of RISC and demonstrate that miRNA processing and target-RNA cleavage are coupled."

        "abstract": "In RNA interference, the RNase-III enzyme Dicer processes exogenous double-stranded RNA into small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). siRNAs guide RNA-induced silencing complexes to cleave homologous transcripts, enabling gene-specific knock-down. In plants, double-stranded RNA is processed into siRNA species of 21 nucleotides (nt) and 24 nt (ref. 5), but, unlike in nematodes, the Dicer enzymes involved in this processing have not been identified. Additionally, in both plants and nematodes, systemic signals with RNA components convey the sequence-specific effects of RNA interference between cells. Here, we describe Arabidopsis thaliana mutants with altered silencing cell-to-cell movement beyond the vasculature. At least three SILENCING MOVEMENT DEFICIENT genes (SMD1, SMD2 and SMD3) are required for trafficking, the extent of which correlates with siRNA levels in the veins. Five alleles defective in synthesis of 21-nt, but not 24-nt, siRNAs carry mutations in Dicer-like 4 (DCL4) that are involved in biogenesis of trans-acting siRNAs. We show that the biogenesis and function of trans-acting siRNA can be genetically uncoupled from a bona fide DCL4-dependent pathway that accounts for RNA interference and for production of the 21-nt siRNA component of the plant cell-to-cell silencing signal."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an abundant class of approximately 22-nucleotide regulatory RNAs found in plants and animals. Some miRNAs of plants, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Drosophila play important gene-regulatory roles during development by pairing to target mRNAs to specify posttranscriptional repression of these messages. We identify three miRNAs that are specifically expressed in hematopoietic cells and show that their expression is dynamically regulated during early hematopoiesis and lineage commitment. One of these miRNAs, miR-181, was preferentially expressed in the B-lymphoid cells of mouse bone marrow, and its ectopic expression in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells led to an increased fraction of B-lineage cells in both tissue-culture differentiation assays and adult mice. Our results indicate that microRNAs are components of the molecular circuitry that controls mouse hematopoiesis and suggest that other microRNAs have similar regulatory roles during other facets of vertebrate development."

        "abstract": "RNA silencing (also known as RNA interference) is a conserved biological response to double-stranded RNA that regulates gene expression, and has evolved in plants as a defence against viruses. The response is mediated by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which guide the sequence-specific degradation of cognate messenger RNAs. As a counter-defence, many viruses encode proteins that specifically inhibit the silencing machinery. The p19 protein from the tombusvirus is such a viral suppressor of RNA silencing and has been shown to bind specifically to siRNA. Here, we report the 1.85-A crystal structure of p19 bound to a 21-nucleotide siRNA, where the 19-base-pair RNA duplex is cradled within the concave face of a continuous eight-stranded beta-sheet, formed across the p19 homodimer interface. Direct and water-mediated intermolecular contacts are restricted to the backbone phosphates and sugar 2'-OH groups, consistent with sequence-independent p19-siRNA recognition. Two alpha-helical 'reading heads' project from opposite ends of the p19 homodimer and position pairs of tryptophans for stacking over the terminal base pairs, thereby measuring and bracketing both ends of the siRNA duplex. Our structure provides an illustration of siRNA sequestering by a viral protein."

        "abstract": "microRNAs are functional, 22 nt, noncoding RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression. Disturbance of microRNA expression may play a role in the initiation and progression of certain diseases. A microRNA expression signature has been identified that is associated with pancreatic cancer. This has been accomplished with the application of real-time PCR profiling of over 200 microRNA precursors on specimens of human pancreatic adenocarcinoma, paired benign tissue, normal pancreas, chronic pancreatitis and nine pancreatic cancer cell lines. Hierarchical clustering was able to distinguish tumor from normal pancreas, pancreatitis and cell lines. The PAM algorithm correctly classified 28 of 28 tumors, 6 of 6 normal pancreas and 11 of 15 adjacent benign tissues. One hundred microRNA precursors were aberrantly expressed in pancreatic cancer or desmoplasia (p < 0.01), including microRNAs previously reported as differentially expressed in other human cancers (miR-155, miR-21, miR-221 and miR-222) as well as those not previously reported in cancer (miR-376a and miR-301). Most of the top aberrantly expressed miRNAs displayed increased expression in the tumor. Expression of the active, mature microRNA was validated using a real-time PCR assay to quantify the mature microRNA and Northern blotting. Reverse transcription in situ PCR showed that three of the top differentially expressed miRNAs (miR-221, -376a and -301) were localized to tumor cells and not to stroma or normal acini or ducts. Aberrant microRNA expression may offer new clues to pancreatic tumorigenesis and may provide diagnostic biomarkers for pancreatic adenocarcinoma."

However, only very few miRNAs have been functionally characterized and the general functions of miRNAs are not globally studied. In this study, we systematically analyzed the expression patterns of miRNA targets using several public microarray profiles. We found that the expression levels of miRNA targets are lower in all mouse and Drosophila tissues than in the embryos. We also found miRNAs more preferentially target ubiquitously expressed genes than tissue-specifically expressed genes. These results support the current suggestion that miRNAs are likely to be largely involved in embryo development and maintaining of tissue identity."

        "title": "Cucumber mosaic virus-encoded 2b suppressor inhibits Arabidopsis Argonaute1 cleavage activity to counter plant defense.",
        "abstract": "RNA silencing refers to small regulatory RNA-mediated processes that repress endogenous gene expression and defend hosts from offending viruses. As an anti-host defense mechanism, viruses encode suppressors that can block RNA silencing pathways. Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV)-encoded 2b protein was among the first suppressors identified that could inhibit post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS), but with little or no effect on miRNA functions. The mechanisms underlying 2b suppression of RNA silencing are unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the CMV 2b protein also interferes with miRNA pathways, eliciting developmental anomalies partially phenocopying ago1 mutant alleles. In contrast to most characterized suppressors, 2b directly interacts with Argonaute1 (AGO1) in vitro and in vivo, and this interaction occurs primarily on one surface of the PAZ-containing module and part of the PIWI-box of AGO1. Consistent with this interaction, 2b specifically inhibits AGO1 cleavage activity in RISC reconstitution assays. In addition, AGO1 recruits virus-derived small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in vivo, suggesting that AGO1 is a major factor in defense against CMV infection. We conclude that 2b blocks AGO1 cleavage activity to inhibit miRNA pathways, attenuate RNA silencing, and counter host defense. These findings provide insight on the molecular arms race between host antiviral RNA silencing and virus counterdefense."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate the expression of a large number of protein-coding genes. Their primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs) have to undergo multiple processing steps to reach the functional form. Little is known about how the processing of miRNAs is modulated. Here we show that the RNA-binding protein DiGeorge critical region-8 (DGCR8), which is essential for the first processing step, is a heme-binding protein. The association with heme promotes dimerization of DGCR8. The heme-bound DGCR8 dimer seems to trimerize upon binding pri-miRNAs and is active in triggering pri-miRNA cleavage, whereas the heme-free monomer is much less active. A heme-binding region of DGCR8 inhibits the pri-miRNA-processing activity of the monomer. This putative autoinhibition is overcome by heme. Our finding that heme is involved in pri-miRNA processing suggests that the gene-regulation network of miRNAs and signal-transduction pathways involving heme might be connected."

        "abstract": "Gene expression in normal cells is highly regulated by complex gene regulatory networks. Disruption of these networks may lead to cancer. Recent studies have revealed the existence of an abundant class of small nonprotein-coding regulatory RNAs, known as microRNAs (miRNAs). MiRNAs may regulate diverse biological processes including development, cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis, through suppressing the expression of their target genes. Posttranscriptional silencing of target genes by miRNAs occurs either by cleavage of homologous target messenger RNAs (mRNAs), or by inhibition of target protein synthesis. Computational predictions indicate that 1 miRNA may target on hundreds of genes, and suggest that over 50% of human protein-coding genes might be regulated by miRNAs. MiRNAs are receiving increased attention in cancer genomic research. We are beginning to understand that miRNAs may act as oncogenes and/or tumor suppressor genes within the molecular architecture of gene regulatory networks, thereby contributing to the development of cancer. MiRNAs may provide useful diagnostic and prognostic markers for cancer diagnosis and treatment, as well as serving as potential therapeutic targets or tools."

        "abstract": "Non-canonical microRNAs are a recently-discovered subset of microRNAs. They structurally and functionally resemble canonical miRNAs, but were found to follow distinct maturation pathways, typically bypassing one or more steps of the classic canonical biogenesis pathway. Non-canonical miRNAs were found to have diverse origins, including introns, snoRNAs, endogenous shRNAs and tRNAs. Our knowledge about their functions remains relatively primitive; however, many interesting discoveries have taken place in the past few years. They have been found to take part in several cellular processes, such as immune response and stem cell proliferation. Adversely, their deregulation has pathologic effects on several different tissues, which strongly suggests an integral role for non-canonical miRNAs in disease pathogenesis. In this review, we discuss the recently-discovered functional characteristics of non-canonical miRNAs and illustrate their principal maturation pathways as well as debating their potential role in multiple cellular processes."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small non-coding RNAs of ~23 nucleotides in length that form up a novel class of regulatory determinants, with a large set of target mRNAs postulated for every single miRNA. Thousands of miRNAs have been discovered so far, with hundreds of them shown to govern biological processes with impact on disease. However, very little is known about how they specifically interfere with biological pathways and disease mechanisms. To investigate this interaction, the hunt for direct miRNA targets that mediate the miRNA effects--the \"needle in the haystack\"--is an essential step. In this review we provide a comprehensive workflow of successfully applied methods starting from the identification of putative miRNA-target pairs, followed by validation of direct miRNA-mRNA interactions, and finally presenting methods that dissect the impact of particular miRNA-target pairs on a biological process or disease. This guide allows the way to be paved for obtaining biologically meaningful miRNA targets."

Here we demonstrate with potato virus X (PVX) that PTGS operates as a systemic, sequence-specific defense system. However, in grafting experiments or with movement defective forms of PVX, we could not detect systemic silencing unless the 25 kDa viral movement protein (p25) was made nonfunctional. Investigation of p25 revealed two branches to the PTGS pathway that converge in the production of 25 nucleotide RNAs corresponding to the target RNA. One of these branches is unique to virus-induced PTGS and is not affected by p25. The second branch is common to both virus- and transgene-induced PTGS, is blocked by p25, and is likely to generate the systemic silencing signal."

The seed segment (positions 2 to 8) adopts an A-helical-like Watson-Crick paired duplex, with both ends of the guide strand anchored in the complex. An arginine, inserted between guide-strand bases 10 and 11 in the binary complex, locking it in an inactive conformation, is released on ternary complex formation. The nucleic-acid-binding channel between the PAZ- and PIWI-containing lobes of argonaute widens on formation of a more open ternary complex. The relationship of structure to function was established by determining cleavage activity of ternary complexes containing position-dependent base mismatch, bulge and 2'-O-methyl modifications. Consistent with the geometry of the ternary complex, bulges residing in the seed segments of the target, but not the guide strand, were better accommodated and their complexes were catalytically active."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) mark a new paradigm of RNA-directed gene expression regulation in a wide spectrum of biological systems. These small non-coding RNAs can contribute to the repertoire of host-pathogen interactions during viral infection. This interplay has important consequences, both for the virus and the host. There have been reported evidences of host-cellular miRNAs modulating the expression of various viral genes, thereby playing a pivotal role in the host-pathogen interaction network. In the hide-and-seek game between the pathogens and the infected host, viruses have evolved highly sophisticated gene-silencing mechanisms to evade host-immune response. Recent reports indicate that virus too encode miRNAs that protect them against cellular antiviral response. Furthermore, they may exploit the cellular miRNA pathway to their own advantage. Nevertheless, our increasing knowledge of the host-virus interaction at the molecular level should lead us toward possible explanations to viral tropism, latency and oncogenesis along with the development of an effective, durable and nontoxic antiviral therapy. Here, we summarize the recent updates on miRNA-induced gene-silencing mechanism, modulating host-virus interactions with a glimpse of the miRNA-based antiviral therapy for near future."

Experimental evidence has shown that miRNAs can play roles as oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes, suggesting their contribution to cancer development and progression.

Therefore, miRNA profiling is used to create signatures for a variety of cancers, indicating that the profile will help further establish molecular diagnosis, prognosis and therapy using miRNAs. This paper introduces the aberrant expression of miRNAs in human cancer, and discusses the potential of these miRNAs as biomarkers and targets/molecules for molecular therapy."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in the regulation of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level by base pairing to the 3'-UTR (untranslated region) of mRNAs. The let-7 miRNA was first discovered in Caenorhabditis elegans and is evolutionarily conserved. We used zebrafish embryos as a vertebrate in vivo system to study substrate requirements for function of let-7. Injection of a double-stranded let-7 miRNA into the zygotes of zebrafish and frogs causes specific phenotypic defects. Only the antisense strand of the let-7 duplex has biological activity. In addition, co-injected mRNA of gfp fused to the 3'-UTR of a zebrafish lin-41 ortholog (a presumed target of let-7) is silenced by let-7. Point mutant studies revealed that the two let-7 target sites in the lin-41 3'-UTR are both essential and sufficient for silencing. let-7 and mir221 together, but not either of them alone, can silence a construct with one of the let-7 target sites replaced by a target site for mir221, showing that two different miRNAs can provide the required cooperative effect. let-7 target sites can be moved around: they are also functional when positioned in the coding sequence or even in the 5'-UTR of gfp. We took advantage of reporter and phenotypic assays to analyze the activity of all possible point mutant derivatives of let-7 and found that only the 5' region is critical for function of let-7."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) represent a family of small noncoding RNAs that are found in plants and animals (for recent reviews, see ). miRNAs are expressed in a developmentally and tissue-specific manner and regulate the translational efficiency and stability of partial or fully sequence-complementary mRNAs. miRNAs are excised in a stepwise process from double-stranded RNA precursors that are embedded in long RNA polymerase II primary transcripts (pri-miRNA). Drosha RNase III catalyzes the first excision event, the release in the nucleus of a hairpin RNA (pre-miRNA), which is followed by export of the pre-miRNA to the cytoplasm and further processing by Dicer to mature miRNAs. Here, we characterize the human DGCR8, the DiGeorge syndrome critical region gene 8, and its Drosophila melanogaster homolog. We provide biochemical and cell-based readouts to demonstrate the requirement of DGCR8 for the maturation of miRNA primary transcripts. RNAi knockdown experiments of fly and human DGCR8 resulted in accumulation of pri-miRNAs and reduction of pre-miRNAs and mature miRNAs. Our results suggest that DGCR8 and Drosha interact in human cells and reside in a functional pri-miRNA processing complex."

In order to exploit the improved hybridization properties of LNA with their target RNA molecules, we designed several LNA-modified oligonucleotide probes for detection of different microRNAs in animals and plants. By modifying DNA oligonucleotides with LNAs using a design, in which every third nucleotide position was substituted by LNA, we could use the probes in northern blot analysis employing standard end-labelling techniques and hybridization conditions. The sensitivity in detecting mature microRNAs by northern blots was increased by at least 10-fold compared to DNA probes, while simultaneously being highly specific, as demonstrated by the use of different single and double mismatched LNA probes. Besides being highly efficient as northern probes, the same LNA-modified oligonucleotide probes would also be useful for miRNA in situ hybridization and miRNA expression profiling by LNA oligonucleotide microarrays."

        "abstract": "RNAi-mediated heterochromatin assembly in fission yeast requires the RNA-induced transcriptional silencing (RITS) complex and a putative RNA-directed RNA polymerase (Rdp1). Here we show that Rdp1 is associated with two conserved proteins, Hrr1, an RNA helicase, and Cid12, a member of the polyA polymerase family, in a complex that has RNA-directed RNA polymerase activity (RDRC, RNA-directed RNA polymerase complex). RDRC physically interacts with RITS in a manner that requires the Dicer ribonuclease (Dcr1) and the Clr4 histone methyltransferase. Moreover, both complexes are localized to the nucleus and associate with noncoding centromeric RNAs in a Dcr1-dependent manner. In cells lacking Rdp1, Hrr1, or Cid12, RITS complexes are devoid of siRNAs and fail to localize to centromeric DNA repeats to initiate heterochromatin assembly. These findings reveal a physical and functional link between Rdp1 and RITS and suggest that noncoding RNAs provide a platform for siRNA-dependent localization of RNAi complexes to specific chromosome regions."

The C. elegans microRNA let-7 and its target lin-41 were the first microRNA::target interaction to be validated in vivo. let-7 molecules form imperfect duplexes with two required let-7 complementary sites in the lin-41 3' UTR. Here, we show that base pairing at both the 5' and 3' ends of the let-7 binding site, as well as the presence of unpaired RNA residues in the predicted duplexes, are required for lin-41 downregulation. In this study, our model for microRNA::target interactions also demonstrates that the context of a microRNA binding can be critical for function, revealing an unforeseen complexity in microRNA::target interactions."

        "abstract": "Plasmids or viral vectors that express short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) have emerged as important tools for the stable inhibition of specific genes by RNA interference. shRNAs are structural and functional homologs of pre-microRNAs, intermediates in the production of endogenously encoded microRNAs (miRNAs). Therefore, overexpressed shRNAs could inhibit miRNA function by competing for a limiting level of one or more factors involved in miRNA biogenesis or function. Here, we demonstrate that overexpressed shRNAs can saturate the activity of endogenous Exportin 5, a factor required for nuclear export of both shRNAs and pre-miRNAs. While shRNA overexpression can therefore inhibit miRNA function, simultaneous overexpression of Exportin 5 reverses this effect. Moreover, Exportin 5 overexpression can significantly enhance RNA interference mediated by shRNAs. These data have implications for the future clinical utilization of shRNAs and also provide a simple method to enhance RNA interference by shRNAs in culture."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are believed to play important roles in developmental and other cellular processes by hybridizing to complementary target mRNA transcripts. This results in either cleavage of the hybridized transcript or negative regulation of translation. Little is known about the regulation or pattern of miRNA expression. The predicted presence of numerous miRNA sequences in higher eukaryotes makes it highly likely that the expression levels of individual miRNA molecules themselves should play an important role in regulating multiple cellular processes. Therefore, determining the pattern of global miRNA expression levels in mammals and other higher eukaryotes is essential to help understand both the mechanism of miRNA transcriptional regulation as well as to help identify miRNA regulated gene expression. Here, we describe a novel method to detect global processed miRNA expression levels in higher eukaryotes, including human, mouse and rats, by using a high-density oligonucleotide array. Array results have been validated by subsequent confirmation of mir expression using northern-blot analysis. Major differences in mir expression have been detected in samples from diverse sources, suggesting highly regulated mir expression, and specific gene regulatory functions for individual miRNA transcripts. For example, five different miRNAs were found to be preferentially expressed in human kidney compared with other human tissues. Comparative analysis of surrounding genomic sequences of the kidney-specific miRNA clusters revealed the occurrence of specific transcription factor binding sites located in conserved phylogenetic foot prints, suggesting that these may be involved in regulating mir expression in kidney."

        "title": "Fatality in mice due to oversaturation of cellular microRNA/short hairpin RNA pathways.",
        "abstract": "RNA interference (RNAi) is a universal and evolutionarily conserved phenomenon of post-transcriptional gene silencing by means of sequence-specific mRNA degradation, triggered by small double-stranded RNAs. Because this mechanism can be efficiently induced in vivo by expressing target-complementary short hairpin RNA (shRNA) from non-viral and viral vectors, RNAi is attractive for functional genomics and human therapeutics. Here we systematically investigate the long-term effects of sustained high-level shRNA expression in livers of adult mice. Robust shRNA expression in all the hepatocytes after intravenous infusion was achieved with an optimized shRNA delivery vector based on duplex-DNA-containing adeno-associated virus type 8 (AAV8). An evaluation of 49 distinct AAV/shRNA vectors, unique in length and sequence and directed against six targets, showed that 36 resulted in dose-dependent liver injury, with 23 ultimately causing death. Morbidity was associated with the downregulation of liver-derived microRNAs (miRNAs), indicating possible competition of the latter with shRNAs for limiting cellular factors required for the processing of various small RNAs. In vitro and in vivo shRNA transfection studies implied that one such factor, shared by the shRNA/miRNA pathways and readily saturated, is the nuclear karyopherin exportin-5. Our findings have fundamental consequences for future RNAi-based strategies in animals and humans, because controlling intracellular shRNA expression levels will be imperative. However, the risk of oversaturating endogenous small RNA pathways can be minimized by optimizing shRNA dose and sequence, as exemplified here by our report of persistent and therapeutic RNAi against human hepatitis B virus in vivo."

        "abstract": "RNA silencing is an evolutionarily conserved system that functions as an antiviral mechanism in higher plants and insects. To counteract RNA silencing, viruses express silencing suppressors that interfere with both siRNA- and microRNA-guided silencing pathways. We used comparative in vitro and in vivo approaches to analyse the molecular mechanism of suppression by three well-studied silencing suppressors. We found that silencing suppressors p19, p21 and HC-Pro each inhibit the intermediate step of RNA silencing via binding to siRNAs, although the molecular features required for duplex siRNA binding differ among the three proteins. None of the suppressors affected the activity of preassembled RISC complexes. In contrast, each suppressor uniformly inhibited the siRNA-initiated RISC assembly pathway by preventing RNA silencing initiator complex formation."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNAs involved in a wide range of basic processes such as cell proliferation, development, apoptosis and stress response. It has recently been found that they are also abnormally expressed in many types of human cancer. We analyzed the genome-wide miRNA expression profile in human thyroid papillary carcinomas (PTCs) using a microarray (miRNACHIP microarray) containing hundreds of human precursor and mature miRNA oligonucleotide probes. Using this approach, we found an aberrant miRNA expression profile that clearly differentiates PTCs from normal thyroid tissues. In particular, a significant increase in miRNA (miR)-221, -222 and -181b was detected in PTCs in comparison with normal thyroid tissue. These results were further confirmed by northern blot and quantitative RT-PCR analyses. Moreover, RT-PCR revealed miR-221, -222 and -181b overexpression in fine needle aspiration biopsies corresponding to thyroid nodules, which were eventually diagnosed as papillary carcinomas after surgery. Finally, miR-221, -222 and -181b overexpression was also demonstrated in transformed rat thyroid cell lines and in mouse models of thyroid carcinogenesis. Functional studies, performed by blocking miR-221 function and by overexpressing miR-221 in human PTC-derived cell lines, suggest a critical role of miR-221 overexpression in thyroid carcinogenesis. In conclusion, these data, taken together, indicate an miRNA signature associated with PTCs, and suggest miRNA deregulation as an important event in thyroid cell transformation."

        "abstract": "Since their discovery as key regulators of early animal development, microRNAs now are recognized as widespread regulators of gene expression. Despite their abundance, little is known regarding the regulation of microRNA biogenesis. We show that three highly conserved muscle-specific microRNAs, miR-1, miR-133 and miR-206, are robustly induced during the myoblast-myotube transition, both in primary human myoblasts and in the mouse mesenchymal C2C12 stem cell line. These microRNAs were not induced during osteogenic conversion of C2C12 cells. Moreover, both loci encoding miR-1, miR-1-1, and miR-1-2, and two of the three encoding miR-133, miR-133a-1 and miR-133a-2, are strongly induced during myogenesis. Some of the induced microRNAs are in intergenic regions, whereas two are transcribed in the opposite direction to the nonmuscle-specific gene in which they are embedded. By using CHIP analysis, we demonstrate that the myogenic factors Myogenin and MyoD bind to regions upstream of these microRNAs and, therefore, are likely to regulate their expression. Because miR-1 and miR-206 are predicted to repress similar mRNA targets, our work suggests that induction of these microRNAs is important in regulating the expression of muscle-specific proteins."

Our increasing knowledge of the role and importance of virally encoded miRNAs will probably offer new insights into how viruses that establish latent infections, such as herpesviruses, avoid elimination by the host innate or adaptive immune system.

This review focuses on the regulatory roles of plant miRNAs during development, in the adaptive response to stresses and in the miRNA pathway itself.

        "abstract": "In recent years, microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as a major class of regulatory genes, present in most metazoans and important for a diverse range of biological functions. Because experimental identification of miRNA targets is difficult, there has been an explosion of computational target predictions. Although the initial round of predictions resulted in very diverse results, subsequent computational and experimental analyses suggested that at least a certain class of conserved miRNA targets can be confidently predicted and that this class of targets is large, covering, for example, at least 30% of all human genes when considering about 60 conserved vertebrate miRNA gene families. Most recent approaches have also shown that there are correlations between domains of miRNA expression and mRNA levels of their targets. Our understanding of miRNA function is still extremely limited, but it may be that by integrating mRNA and miRNA sequence and expression data with other comparative genomic data, we will be able to gain global and yet specific insights into the function and evolution of a broad layer of post-transcriptional control."

The method uses highly specific washing conditions for RNA oligonucleotide probes conjugated to a fluorescein hapten. We show that this method detects predominantly mature miRNAs rather than the miRNA precursors or primary transcripts. We have determined expression patterns for several miRNAs expressed in the developing and adult nervous system, including miR-124a, miR-9, miR-92, and miR-204. Whereas miR-124a is expressed in neurons, miR-9 is expressed in neural progenitors and some neurons, and miR-204 is expressed in the choroid plexus, retinal pigment epithelium, and ciliary body. miR-204 is located in an intron of the TRPM3 gene, and the TRPM3 mRNA is coexpressed with miR-204 in the choroid plexus. We also find that primary transcripts for miR-124a and miR-9 genes are expressed in patterns similar to their respective mature miRNAs. The ability to visualize expression of specific miRNAs in embryos and tissues should aid studies on miRNA function."

Many mammalian miRNAs are expressed in a tissue-specific manner, a phenomenon that has so far been attributed to transcriptional regulation. We here show by Northern blots and in situ hybridization experiments that the expression of mammalian miRNAs can be regulated at the post-transcriptional level. In particular, miR-138 is spatially restricted to distinct cell types, while its precursor, pre-miR-138-2, is ubiquitously expressed throughout all tissues analyzed. Furthermore, pre-miR-138-2 is exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, suggesting that cleavage of this pre-miRNA by Dicer is restricted to certain tissues and cell types. Thus, differential processing of pre-miRNAs might be an alternative mechanism to control miRNA function."

We show here that virus-derived small RNAs produced by Arabidopsis Dicer-like 4 (DCL4) program an effector complex conferring antiviral immunity. Inhibition of DCL4 by a viral-encoded suppressor revealed the subordinate antiviral activity of DCL2. Accordingly, inactivating both DCL2 and DCL4 was necessary and sufficient to restore systemic infection of a suppressor-deficient virus. The effects of DCL2 were overcome by increasing viral dosage in inoculated leaves, but this could not surmount additional, non-cell autonomous effects of DCL4 specifically preventing viral unloading from the vasculature. These findings define a molecular framework for studying antiviral silencing and defense in plants."

        "abstract": "microRNAs (miRNAs) are short ~22 nucleotides (nt) ribonucleic acids which post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression. miRNAs are key regulators of all cellular processes, and the correct expression of miRNAs in an organism is crucial for proper development and cellular function. As a result, the miRNA biogenesis pathway is highly regulated. In this review, we outline the basic steps of miRNA biogenesis and miRNA mediated gene regulation focusing on the role of RNA binding proteins (RBPs). We also describe multiple mechanisms that regulate the canonical miRNA pathway, which depends on a wide range of RBPs. Moreover, we hypothesise that the interaction between miRNA regulation and RBPs is potentially more widespread based on the analysis of available high-throughput datasets."

        "title": "Molecular basis for the recognition of primary microRNAs by the Drosha-DGCR8 complex.",
        "abstract": "The Drosha-DGCR8 complex initiates microRNA maturation by precise cleavage of the stem loops that are embedded in primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs). Here we propose a model for this process that is based upon evidence from both computational and biochemical analyses. A typical metazoan pri-miRNA consists of a stem of approximately 33 bp, with a terminal loop and flanking segments. The terminal loop is unessential, whereas the flanking ssRNA segments are critical for processing. The cleavage site is determined mainly by the distance (approximately 11 bp) from the stem-ssRNA junction. Purified DGCR8, but not Drosha, interacts with pri-miRNAs both directly and specifically, and the flanking ssRNA segments are vital for this binding to occur. Thus, DGCR8 may function as the molecular anchor that measures the distance from the dsRNA-ssRNA junction. Our current study thus facilitates the prediction of novel microRNAs and will assist in the rational design of small hairpin RNAs for RNA interference."

        "title": "A mutation creating a potential illegitimate microRNA target site in the myostatin gene affects muscularity in sheep.",
        "abstract": "Texel sheep are renowned for their exceptional meatiness. To identify the genes underlying this economically important feature, we performed a whole-genome scan in a Romanov x Texel F2 population. We mapped a quantitative trait locus with a major effect on muscle mass to chromosome 2 and subsequently fine-mapped it to a chromosome interval encompassing the myostatin (GDF8) gene. We herein demonstrate that the GDF8 allele of Texel sheep is characterized by a G to A transition in the 3' UTR that creates a target site for mir1 and mir206, microRNAs (miRNAs) that are highly expressed in skeletal muscle. This causes translational inhibition of the myostatin gene and hence contributes to the muscular hypertrophy of Texel sheep. Analysis of SNP databases for humans and mice demonstrates that mutations creating or destroying putative miRNA target sites are abundant and might be important effectors of phenotypic variation."

        "title": "A novel class of small RNAs bind to MILI protein in mouse testes.",
        "abstract": "Small RNAs bound to Argonaute proteins recognize partially or fully complementary nucleic acid targets in diverse gene-silencing processes. A subgroup of the Argonaute proteins--known as the 'Piwi family'--is required for germ- and stem-cell development in invertebrates, and two Piwi members--MILI and MIWI--are essential for spermatogenesis in mouse. Here we describe a new class of small RNAs that bind to MILI in mouse male germ cells, where they accumulate at the onset of meiosis. The sequences of the over 1,000 identified unique molecules share a strong preference for a 5' uridine, but otherwise cannot be readily classified into sequence families. Genomic mapping of these small RNAs reveals a limited number of clusters, suggesting that these RNAs are processed from long primary transcripts. The small RNAs are 26-31 nucleotides (nt) in length--clearly distinct from the 21-23 nt of microRNAs (miRNAs) or short interfering RNAs (siRNAs)--and we refer to them as 'Piwi-interacting RNAs' or piRNAs. Orthologous human chromosomal regions also give rise to small RNAs with the characteristics of piRNAs, but the cloned sequences are distinct. The identification of this new class of small RNAs provides an important starting point to determine the molecular function of Piwi proteins in mammalian spermatogenesis."

        "abstract": "Small RNAs associate with Argonaute proteins and serve as sequence-specific guides to regulate messenger RNA stability, protein synthesis, chromatin organization and genome structure. In animals, Argonaute proteins segregate into two subfamilies. The Argonaute subfamily acts in RNA interference and in microRNA-mediated gene regulation using 21-22-nucleotide RNAs as guides. The Piwi subfamily is involved in germline-specific events such as germline stem cell maintenance and meiosis. However, neither the biochemical function of Piwi proteins nor the nature of their small RNA guides is known. Here we show that MIWI, a murine Piwi protein, binds a previously uncharacterized class of approximately 29-30-nucleotide RNAs that are highly abundant in testes. We have therefore named these Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs). piRNAs show distinctive localization patterns in the genome, being predominantly grouped into 20-90-kilobase clusters, wherein long stretches of small RNAs are derived from only one strand. Similar piRNAs are also found in human and rat, with major clusters occurring in syntenic locations. Although their function must still be resolved, the abundance of piRNAs in germline cells and the male sterility of Miwi mutants suggest a role in gametogenesis."

        "abstract": "Canonical RNAi, one of the so-called RNA-silencing mechanisms, is defined as sequence-specific RNA degradation induced by long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). RNAi occurs in four basic steps: (i) processing of long dsRNA by RNase III Dicer into small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes, (ii) loading of one of the siRNA strands on an Argonaute protein possessing endonucleolytic activity, (iii) target recognition through siRNA basepairing, and (iv) cleavage of the target by the Argonaute's endonucleolytic activity. This basic pathway diversified and blended with other RNA silencing pathways employing small RNAs. In some organisms, RNAi is extended by an amplification loop employing an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which generates secondary siRNAs from targets of primary siRNAs. Given the high specificity of RNAi and its presence in invertebrates, it offers an opportunity for highly selective pest control. The aim of this text is to provide an introductory overview of key mechanistic aspects of RNA interference for understanding its potential and constraints for its use in pest control."

        "abstract": "Thousands of mammalian messenger RNAs are under selective pressure to maintain 7-nucleotide sites matching microRNAs (miRNAs). We found that these conserved targets are often highly expressed at developmental stages before miRNA expression and that their levels tend to fall as the miRNA that targets them begins to accumulate. Nonconserved sites, which outnumber the conserved sites 10 to 1, also mediate repression. As a consequence, genes preferentially expressed at the same time and place as a miRNA have evolved to selectively avoid sites matching the miRNA. This phenomenon of selective avoidance extends to thousands of genes and enables spatial and temporal specificities of miRNAs to be revealed by finding tissues and developmental stages in which messages with corresponding sites are expressed at lower levels."

        "abstract": "A novel microRNA (miRNA) quantification method has been developed using stem-loop RT followed by TaqMan PCR analysis. Stem-loop RT primers are better than conventional ones in terms of RT efficiency and specificity. TaqMan miRNA assays are specific for mature miRNAs and discriminate among related miRNAs that differ by as little as one nucleotide. Furthermore, they are not affected by genomic DNA contamination. Precise quantification is achieved routinely with as little as 25 pg of total RNA for most miRNAs. In fact, the high sensitivity, specificity and precision of this method allows for direct analysis of a single cell without nucleic acid purification. Like standard TaqMan gene expression assays, TaqMan miRNA assays exhibit a dynamic range of seven orders of magnitude. Quantification of five miRNAs in seven mouse tissues showed variation from less than 10 to more than 30,000 copies per cell. This method enables fast, accurate and sensitive miRNA expression profiling and can identify and monitor potential biomarkers specific to tissues or diseases. Stem-loop RT-PCR can be used for the quantification of other small RNA molecules such as short interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Furthermore, the concept of stem-loop RT primer design could be applied in small RNA cloning and multiplex assays for better specificity and efficiency."

The finding that microRNAs are misexpressed in cancers has reinforced the idea that their regulatory roles are very important."

        "abstract": "Our current knowledge of the deregulation that occurs during the onset and progression of cancer and other diseases leads us to recognize both genetic and epigenetic alterations as being at the core of the pathological state. The epigenetic landscape includes a variety of covalent modifications that affect the methylation status of DNA but also the post-translational modifications of histones, and determines the structural features of chromatin that ultimately control the transcriptional outcome of the cell to accommodate developmental, proliferative or environmental requirements. MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that regulate the expression of complementary messenger RNAs and function as key controllers in a myriad of cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. In the last few years, increasing evidence has indicated that a substantial number of microRNA genes are subjected to epigenetic alterations, resulting in aberrant patterns of expression upon the occurrence of cancer. In this review we discuss microRNA genes that are epigenetically modified in cancer cells, and the role that microRNAs themselves can have as chromatin modifiers."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an abundant class of gene regulatory molecules (reviewed in refs 1, 2). Although computational work indicates that miRNAs repress more than a third of human genes, their roles in vertebrate development are only now beginning to be determined. Here we show that miR-196 acts upstream of Hoxb8 and Sonic hedgehog (Shh) in vivo in the context of limb development, thereby identifying a previously observed but uncharacterized inhibitory activity that operates specifically in the hindlimb. Our data indicate that miR-196 functions in a fail-safe mechanism to assure the fidelity of expression domains that are primarily regulated at the transcriptional level, supporting the idea that many vertebrate miRNAs may function as a secondary level of gene regulation."

Each miRNA is believed to regulate the expression of multiple mRNA targets, and many miRNAs have been linked to the initiation and progression of human cancer. miRNAs control various activities of the immune system and different stages of hematopoietic development, and their misexpression is the cause of various blood malignancies. Certain miRNAs have oncogenic activities, whereas others have the potential to act as tumor suppressors. Because they control fundamental processes such as differentiation, cell growth and cell death, the study of the role of miRNAs in human neoplasms holds great promise for novel forms of therapy. Here, we summarize the role of miRNAs and their targets in contributing to human cancers and their function as regulators of apoptotic pathways and the immune system."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been implicated in regulating various aspects of animal development, but their functions in neurogenesis are largely unknown. Here we report that loss of miR-9a function in the Drosophila peripheral nervous system leads to ectopic production of sensory organ precursors (SOPs), whereas overexpression of miR-9a results in a severe loss of SOPs. We further demonstrate a strong genetic interaction between miR-9a and senseless (sens) in controlling the formation of SOPs in the adult wing imaginal disc. Moreover, miR-9a suppresses Sens expression through its 3' untranslated region. miR-9a is expressed in epithelial cells, including those adjacent to SOPs within proneural clusters, suggesting that miR-9a normally inhibits neuronal fate in non-SOP cells by down-regulating Sens expression. These results indicate that miR-9a ensures the generation of the precise number of neuronal precursor cells during development."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an abundant new class of non-coding approximately 20-24 nt small RNAs. To date, 872 miRNAs, belonging to 42 families, have been identified in 71 plant species by genetic screening, direct cloning after isolation of small RNAs, computational strategy, and expressed sequence tag (EST) analysis. Many plant miRNAs are evolutionarily conserved from species to species, some from angiosperms to mosses. miRNAs may originate from inverted duplications of target gene sequences in plants. Although miRNA precursors display high variability, their mature sequences display extensive sequence complementarity to their target mRNA sequences. miRNAs play important roles in plant post-transcriptional gene regulation by targeting mRNAs for cleavage or repressing translation. miRNAs are involved in plant development, signal transduction, protein degradation, response to environmental stress and pathogen invasion, and regulate their own biogenesis. miRNAs regulate the expression of many important genes; a majority of these genes are transcriptional factors."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs play important roles in cell differentiation by acting as translational inhibitors of specific target genes. Here we show that human granulocytic differentiation is controlled by a regulatory circuitry involving miR-223 and two transcriptional factors, NFI-A and C/EBPalpha. The two factors compete for binding to the miR-223 promoter: NFI-A maintains miR-223 at low levels, whereas its replacement by C/EBPalpha, following retinoic acid (RA)-induced differentiation, upregulates miR-223 expression. The competition by C/EBPalpha and the granulocytic differentiation are favored by a negative-feedback loop in which miR-223 represses NFI-A translation. In line with this, both RNAi against NFI-A and ectopic expression of miR-223 in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells enhance differentiation, whereas miR-223 knockdown inhibits the differentiation response to RA. Altogether, our data indicate that miR-223 plays a crucial role during granulopoiesis and point to the NFI-A repression as an important molecular pathway mediating gene reprogramming in this cell lineage."

        "abstract": "In Arabidopsis, canonical 21-nt miRNAs are generated by Dicer-like (DCL) 1 from hairpin precursors. We have identified a novel class of functional 23- to 25-nt long-miRNAs that is generated independently from the same miRNA precursors by DCL3. Long-miRNAs are developmentally regulated and in some cases have been conserved during evolution implying that they have biological functions. Plant microRNA genes (MIR) have been proposed to evolve by inverted duplication of the target gene. We found that recently evolved MIR genes consistently give rise to long-miRNAs, while ancient MIR genes give rise predominantly to canonical miRNAs. Transcripts from inverted repeats representing evolving proto-MIR genes were processed by DCL3 into long-miRNAs and also by DCL1, DCL2 or DCL4 depending on hairpin stem length to produce different sizes of miRNAs. Our results suggest that evolution of MIR genes is associated with gradual, overlapping changes in DCL usage resulting in specific size classes of miRNAs."

The present review focuses on recent findings in this exciting new area of research, with special emphasis on the involvement of miRNAs in cancer development and progression.

Discovered only recently, it has become clear that they are involved in many biological processes such as developmental timing, differentiation and cell death. Data that connect miRNAs to various kinds of diseases, particularly cancer, are accumulating. miRNAs can influence cancer development in many ways, including the regulation of cell proliferation, cell transformation, and cell death. In this review, we focus on miRNAs that have been shown to play a role in the regulation of apoptosis. We first describe in detail how Drosophila has been utilized as a model organism to connect several miRNAs with the cell death machinery. We discuss the genetic approaches that led to the identification of those miRNAs and subsequent work that helped to establish their function. In the second part of the review article, we focus on the involvement of miRNAs in apoptosis regulation in mammals. Intriguingly, many of the miRNAs that regulate apoptosis have been shown to affect cancer development. In the end, we discuss a virally encoded miRNA that influences the cell death response in the mammalian host cell. In summary, the data gathered over the recent years clearly show the potential and important role of miRNAs to regulate apoptosis at various levels and in several organisms."

Examination of tumor-specific miRNA expression profiles has revealed widespread dysregulation of these molecules in diverse cancers. Although studies addressing their role in cancer pathogenesis are at an early stage, it is apparent that loss- or gain-of-function of specific miRNAs contributes to cellular transformation and tumorigenesis. The available evidence clearly demonstrates that these molecules are intertwined with cellular pathways regulated by classical oncogenes and tumor suppressors such as MYC, RAS and p53. Incorporation of miRNA regulation into current models of molecular cancer pathogenesis will be essential to achieve a complete understanding of this group of diseases."

The genetic dissection of hot spots for chromosomal abnormalities in the age of the sequenced human genome resulted in the discovery that microRNA (miRNA) genes, encoding for a class of small noncoding RNAs, frequently resides in such genomic regions. The combination of nonrandom chromosomal abnormalities and other types of genetic alterations or epigenetic events contribute to downregulation or overexpression of miRNAs.

Here, we report the spatial patterns of miRNA transcription during Drosophila embryonic development, as revealed by in situ hybridization to nascent miRNA transcripts. We detect expression of 15 \"stand-alone\" miRNA loci and 9 intronic miRNA loci, which collectively represent 38 miRNA genes. We observe great variety in the spatial patterns of miRNA transcription, including preblastoderm stripes, in aspects of the central and peripheral nervous systems, and in cellular subsets of the mesoderm and endoderm. We also describe an intronic miRNA (miR-7) whose expression pattern is distinct from that of its host mRNA (bancal), which demonstrates that intronic miRNAs can be subject to independent cis-regulatory control. Intriguingly, the expression patterns of several fly miRNAs are analogous to those of their vertebrate counterparts, suggesting that these miRNAs may have ancient roles in animal patterning."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRs) are small noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression primarily through translational repression. In erythropoietic (E) culture of cord blood CD34+ progenitor cells, the level of miR 221 and 222 is gradually and sharply down-modulated. Hypothetically, this decline could promote erythropoiesis by unblocking expression of key functional proteins. Indeed, (i) bioinformatic analysis suggested that miR 221 and 222 target the 3' UTR of kit mRNA; (ii) the luciferase assay confirmed that both miRs directly interact with the kit mRNA target site; and (iii) in E culture undergoing exponential cell growth, miR down-modulation is inversely related to increasing kit protein expression, whereas the kit mRNA level is relatively stable. Functional studies show that treatment of CD34+ progenitors with miR 221 and 222, via oligonucleotide transfection or lentiviral vector infection, causes impaired proliferation and accelerated differentiation of E cells, coupled with down-modulation of kit protein: this phenomenon, observed in E culture releasing endogenous kit ligand, is magnified in E culture supplemented with kit ligand. Furthermore, transplantation experiments in NOD-SCID mice reveal that miR 221 and 222 treatment of CD34+ cells impairs their engraftment capacity and stem cell activity. Finally, miR 221 and 222 gene transfer impairs proliferation of the kit+ TF-1 erythroleukemic cell line. Altogether, our studies indicate that the decline of miR 221 and 222 during exponential E growth unblocks kit protein production at mRNA level, thus leading to expansion of early erythroblasts. Furthermore, the results on kit+ erythroleukemic cells suggest a potential role of these miRs in cancer therapy."

These transcripts are associated with cell proliferation, cell differentiation, cell death and carcinogenesis. We analysed the miRNA expression profiles in 25 pairs of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and adjacent non-tumorous tissue (NT) and nine additional chronic hepatitis (CH) specimens using a human miRNA microarray. Targets and references samples were co-hybridized to a microarray containing whole human mature and precursor miRNA sequences. Whereas three miRNAs exhibited higher expression in the HCC samples than that in the NT samples, five miRNAs demonstrated lower expression in the HCC samples than in the NT samples (P<0.0001). Classification of samples as HCC or NT by using support vector machine algorithms based on these data provided an overall prediction accuracy of 97.8% (45/46). In addition, the expression levels of four miRNAs were inversely correlated with the degree of HCC differentiation (P<0.01). A comparison of CH and liver cirrhosis samples revealed significantly different pattern of miRNA expression (P<0.01). There were no differences, however, between hepatitis B-positive and hepatitis C-positive samples. This information may help clarify the molecular mechanisms involved in the progression of liver disease, potentially serving as a diagnostic tool of HCC."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs are small noncoding RNAs that serve as posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression in higher eukaryotes. Their widespread and important role in animals is highlighted by recent estimates that 20%-30% of all genes are microRNA targets. Here, we report that a large set of genes involved in basic cellular processes avoid microRNA regulation due to short 3'UTRs that are specifically depleted of microRNA binding sites. For individual microRNAs, we find that coexpressed genes avoid microRNA sites, whereas target genes and microRNAs are preferentially expressed in neighboring tissues. This mutually exclusive expression argues that microRNAs confer accuracy to developmental gene-expression programs, thus ensuring tissue identity and supporting cell-lineage decisions."

        "title": "In-depth characterization of the microRNA transcriptome in a leukemia progression model.",
        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to play important roles in physiological as well as multiple malignant processes, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In an effort to gain further insight into the role of miRNAs in AML, we have applied the Illumina massively parallel sequencing platform to carry out an in-depth analysis of the miRNA transcriptome in a murine leukemia progression model. This model simulates the stepwise conversion of a myeloid progenitor cell by an engineered overexpression of the nucleoporin 98 (NUP98)-homeobox HOXD13 fusion gene (ND13), to aggressive AML inducing cells upon transduction with the oncogenic collaborator Meis1. From this data set, we identified 307 miRNA/miRNA species in the ND13 cells and 306 miRNA/miRNA species in ND13+Meis1 cells, corresponding to 223 and 219 miRNA genes. Sequence counts varied between two and 136,558, indicating a remarkable expression range between the detected miRNA species. The large number of miRNAs expressed and the nature of differential expression suggest that leukemic progression as modeled here is dictated by the repertoire of shared, but differentially expressed miRNAs. Our finding of extensive sequence variations (isomiRs) for almost all miRNA and miRNA species adds additional complexity to the miRNA transcriptome. A stringent target prediction analysis coupled with in vitro target validation revealed the potential for miRNA-mediated release of oncogenes that facilitates leukemic progression from the preleukemic to leukemia inducing state. Finally, 55 novel miRNAs species were identified in our data set, adding further complexity to the emerging world of small RNAs."

        "title": "siRNA function in RNAi: a chemical modification analysis.",
        "abstract": "Various chemical modifications were created in short-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to determine the biochemical properties required for RNA interference (RNAi). Remarkably, modifications at the 2'-position of pentose sugars in siRNAs showed the 2'-OHs were not required for RNAi, indicating that RNAi machinery does not require the 2'-OH for recognition of siRNAs and catalytic ribonuclease activity of RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISCs) does not involve the 2'-OH of guide antisense RNA. In addition, 2' modifications predicted to stabilize siRNA increased the persistence of RNAi as compared with wild-type siRNAs. RNAi was also induced with chemical modifications that stabilized interactions between A-U base pairs, demonstrating that these types of modifications may enhance mRNA targeting efficiency in allele-specific RNAi. Modifications altering the structure of the A-form major groove of antisense siRNA-mRNA duplexes abolished RNAi, suggesting that the major groove of these duplexes was required for recognition by activated RISC*. Comparative analysis of the stability and RNAi activities of chemically modified single-stranded antisense RNA and duplex siRNA suggested that some catalytic mechanism(s) other than siRNA stability were linked to RNAi efficiency. Modified or mismatched ribonucleotides incorporated at internal positions in the 5' or 3' half of the siRNA duplex, as defined by the antisense strand, indicated that the integrity of the 5' and not the 3' half of the siRNA structure was important for RNAi, highlighting the asymmetric nature of siRNA recognition for initiation of unwinding. Collectively, this study defines the mechanisms of RNAi in human cells and provides new rules for designing effective and stable siRNAs for RNAi-mediated gene-silencing applications."

        "abstract": "We have identified microRNAs (miRNAs) in undifferentiated and differentiated mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. Some of these appear to be ES cell specific, have related sequences, and are encoded by genomic loci clustered within 2.2 kb of each other. Their expression is repressed as ES cells differentiate into embryoid bodies and is undetectable in adult mouse organs. In contrast, the levels of many previously described miRNAs remain constant or increase upon differentiation. Our results suggest that miRNAs may have a role in the maintenance of the pluripotent cell state and in the regulation of early mammalian development."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a large family of small, approximately 20-22 nucleotide, noncoding RNAs that regulate the expression of target genes, at the post-transcriptional level. miRNAs are involved in virtually diverse biological processes and play crucial roles in cellular processes, such as cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. Accumulating lines of evidence have indicated that miRNAs play important roles in the maintenance of biological homeostasis and that aberrant expression levels of miRNAs are associated with the onset of many diseases, including cancer. It is possible that the diverse roles that miRNAs play, have potential to provide valuable information in a clinical setting, demonstrating the potential to act as both screening tools for the stratification of high-risk patients, while informing the treatment decision-making process. Increasing evidence suggests that some miRNAs may even provide assistance in the diagnosis of patients with breast cancer. In addition, miRNAs may themselves be considered therapeutic targets, with inhibition or reintroduction of a particular miRNA capable of inducing a response in-vivo. This chapter discusses the role of miRNAs as oncogenes and tumor suppressors in breast cancer development and metastasis . It focuses on miRNAs that have prognostic, diagnostic, or predictive potential in breast cancer as well as the possible challenges in the translation of such observations to the clinic."

        "title": "Developmental defects by antisense-mediated inactivation of micro-RNAs 2 and 13 in Drosophila and the identification of putative target genes.",
        "abstract": "Micro-RNAs are a class of small non-coding regulatory RNAs that impair translation by imperfect base pairing to mRNAs. For analysis of their cellular function we injected different miRNA-specific DNA antisense oligonucleotides in Drosophila embryos. In four cases we observed severe interference with normal development, one had a moderate impact and six oligonucleotides did not cause detectable phenotypes. We further used the miR-13a DNA antisense oligonucleotide as a PCR primer on a cDNA library template. In this experimental way we identified nine Drosophila genes, which are characterised by 3' untranslated region motifs that allow imperfect duplex formation with miR-13 or related miRNAs. These genes, which include Sos and Myd88, represent putative targets for miRNA regulation. Mutagenesis of the target motif of two genes followed by transfection in Drosophila Schneider 2 (S2) cells and subsequent reporter gene analysis confirmed the hypothesis that the binding potential of miR-13 is inversely correlated with gene expression."

        "abstract": "Plants with altered microRNA metabolism have pleiotropic developmental defects, but direct evidence for microRNAs regulating specific aspects of plant morphogenesis has been lacking. In a genetic screen, we identified the JAW locus, which produces a microRNA that can guide messenger RNA cleavage of several TCP genes controlling leaf development. MicroRNA-guided cleavage of TCP4 mRNA is necessary to prevent aberrant activity of the TCP4 gene expressed from its native promoter. In addition, overexpression of wild-type and microRNA-resistant TCP variants demonstrates that mRNA cleavage is largely sufficient to restrict TCP function to its normal domain of activity. TCP genes with microRNA target sequences are found in a wide range of species, indicating that microRNA-mediated control of leaf morphogenesis is conserved in plants with very different leaf forms."

        "abstract": "Regulation of gene activity by microRNAs is critical to myriad aspects of eukaryotic development and physiology. Amidst an extensive regulatory web that is predicted to involve thousands of transcripts, emergent themes are now beginning to illustrate how microRNAs have been incorporated into diverse settings. These include potent inhibition of individual key targets, fine-tuning of target activity, the coordinated regulation of target batteries, and the reversibility of some aspects of microRNA-mediated repression. Such themes may reflect some of the inherent advantages of exploiting microRNA control in biological circuits, and provide insight into the consequences of microRNA dysfunction in disease."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in gene regulatory networks in animals. Yet, the mechanistic details of their function in translation inhibition or messenger RNA (mRNA) destabilization remain controversial. To directly examine the earliest events in this process, we have developed an in vitro translation system using mouse Krebs-2 ascites cell-free extract that exhibits an authentic miRNA response. We show here that translation initiation, specifically the 5' cap recognition process, is repressed by endogenous let-7 miRNAs within the first 15 minutes of mRNA exposure to the extract when no destabilization of the transcript is observed. Our results indicate that inhibition of translation initiation is the earliest molecular event effected by miRNAs. Other mechanisms, such as mRNA degradation, may subsequently consolidate mRNA silencing."

        "abstract": "microRNAs (miRNAs) are a newly identified and surprisingly large class of endogenous tiny regulatory RNAs. They exhibit various expressional patterns and are highly conserved across species. Recently, several regulatory targets of miRNAs have been predicted. Functional analysis of the potential targets indicated that miRNAs may be involved in a wide range of pivotally biological events. The nature of miRNAs and their intersection with small interfering RNAs endow them with many regulatory advantages over proteins and make them a potent and novel means to regulate gene expression at almost all levels. Here we argue that miRNAs are key participants in gene regulatory network."

        "abstract": "One manifestation of RNA silencing, known as post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) in plants and RNA interference (RNAi) in animals, is a nucleotide sequence-specific RNA turnover mechanism with the outstanding property of propagating throughout the organism, most likely via movement of nucleic acids. Here, the cell-to-cell movement of RNA silencing in plants is investigated. We show that a short-distance movement process, once initiated from a small group of cells, can spread over a limited and nearly constant number of cells, independent of the presence of homologous transcripts. There is also a long-range cell-to-cell movement process that occurs as a relay amplification, which requires the combined activity of SDE1, a putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and SDE3, a putative RNA helicase. Extensive and limited cell-to-cell movements of silencing are triggered by the same molecules, occur within the same tissues and likely recruit the same plasmodesmata channels. We propose that they are in fact manifestations of the same process, and that extensive cell-to-cell movement of RNA silencing results from re-iterated short-distance signalling events. The likely nature of the nucleic acids involved is presented."

In a few short years, their mechanism of action has been described in various cell lineages within the immune system, targets have been defined and their unique contributions to immune cell function have been examined. Certain miRNAs serve in important negative feedback loops in the immune system, whereas others serve to amplify the response of the immune system by repressing inhibitors of the response. Here, we review some of the better understood mechanisms as well as some emerging concepts of miRNA function. Future work will likely involve defining the function of specific miRNAs in specific immune cell lineages and to utilize them in the design of therapeutic strategies for diseases involving the immune system."

        "abstract": "Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) guide distinct classes of RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISCs) to repress mRNA expression in biological processes ranging from development to antiviral defense. In Drosophila, separate but conceptually similar endonucleolytic pathways produce siRNAs and miRNAs. Here, we show that despite their distinct biogenesis, double-stranded miRNAs and siRNAs participate in a common sorting step that partitions them into Ago1- or Ago2-containing effector complexes. These distinct complexes silence their target RNAs by different mechanisms. miRNA-loaded Ago2-RISC mediates RNAi, but only Ago1 is able to repress an mRNA with central mismatches in its miRNA-binding sites. Conversely, Ago1 cannot mediate RNAi, because it is an inefficient nuclease whose catalytic rate is limited by the dissociation of its reaction products. Thus, the two members of the Drosophila Ago subclade of Argonaute proteins are functionally specialized, but specific small RNA classes are not restricted to associate with Ago1 or Ago2."

        "abstract": "In Drosophila, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which direct RNA interference through the Argonaute protein Ago2, are produced by a biogenesis pathway distinct from microRNAs (miRNAs), which regulate endogenous mRNA expression as guides for Ago1. Here, we report that siRNAs and miRNAs are sorted into Ago1 and Ago2 by pathways independent from the processes that produce these two classes of small RNAs. Such small-RNA sorting reflects the structure of the double-stranded assembly intermediates--the miRNA/miRNA( *) and siRNA duplexes--from which Argonaute proteins are loaded. We find that the Dcr-2/R2D2 heterodimer acts as a gatekeeper for the assembly of Ago2 complexes, promoting the incorporation of siRNAs and disfavoring miRNAs as loading substrates for Drosophila Ago2. A separate mechanism acts in parallel to favor miRNA/miRNA( *) duplexes and exclude siRNAs from assembly into Ago1 complexes. Thus, in flies small-RNA duplexes are actively sorted into Argonaute-containing complexes according to their intrinsic structures."

        "abstract": "A fundamental process during both embryo development and stem cell differentiation is the control of cell lineage determination. In developing skeletal muscle, many of the diffusible signaling molecules, transcription factors and more recently non-coding RNAs that contribute to this process have been identified. This has facilitated advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the control of cell fate choice. Here we will review the role of non-coding RNAs, in particular microRNAs (miRNAs), in embryonic muscle development and differentiation, and in satellite cells of adult muscle, which are essential for muscle growth and regeneration. Some of these short post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression are restricted to skeletal muscle, but their expression can also be more widespread. In addition, we discuss a few examples of long non-coding RNAs, which are numerous but much less well understood."

        "title": "MicroRNAs as therapeutic targets in human diseases.",
        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important endogenous regulators of gene expression. The specific regulation at both the transcription and the translation level (inhibition or mRNA degradation) opens an avenue to use these small RNA molecules as potential targets for the development of novel drugs as well as for the diagnosis of several human diseases. Important information about the role of a miRNA in disease can be deduced by mimicking or inhibiting its activity and examining its impact on the phenotype/behaviour of the cell or organism. Modulating the activity of a miRNA is expected to lead to improvement in disease symptoms and this implies that the target miRNA plays an important role in the disease. It is also now possible to develop miRNA-based therapeutic products that can either increase or decrease the levels of proteins in pathophysiological conditions such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, viral diseases, metabolic disorders and programmed cell death. The commercial potential of miRNA and related drugs is expected to exponentially increase within the next few years, yet there are several areas in miRNA biology and delivery that need to be extensively investigated."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are 19-24 nucleotide noncoding RNAs that regulate the translation and degradation of target mRNAs and are extensively involved in human cancers. One unexpected conclusion of the profiling and functional studies in tumourigenesis is that some miRNAs behave in cancer cells in a dual mode, resembling the 'Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde' story, which centers on a conception of humanity as dual in nature. The authors and others have found that onco-miRNAs and suppressor-miRNAs can represent two different looks of the same gene, behaving as oncogenes or tumour suppressors depending on tissue type and specific targets. In this review, the authors analyse the regulatory mechanisms of the main miRNA genes involved in human tumourigenesis."

Here we describe a recapitulation of let-7 miRNA-mediated translational repression in a cell-free system, which was established with extracts prepared from HEK293F cells overexpressing miRNA pathway components. In this system, both the cap and poly(A) tail are required for the translational repression, and let-7 directs the deadenylation of target mRNAs. Our work suggests that let-7 miRNPs containing Argonaute and GW182 impair the synergistic enhancement of translation by the 5'-cap and 3'-poly(A) tail, resulting in translational repression."

        "abstract": "Non-coding RNAs generally form ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes with their partner proteins to exert their functions. Small RNAs, including microRNAs, small interfering RNAs, and PIWI-interacting RNAs, assemble with Argonaute (Ago) family proteins into the effector complex called RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which mediates sequence-specific target gene silencing. RISC assembly is not a simple binding between a small RNA and Ago; rather, it follows an ordered multi-step pathway that requires specific accessory factors. Some steps of RISC assembly and RISC-mediated gene silencing are dependent on or facilitated by particular intracellular platforms, suggesting their spatial regulation. In this review, we summarize the currently known mechanisms for RISC assembly of each small RNA class and propose a revised model for the role of the chaperone machinery in the duplex-initiated RISC assembly pathway.

Here, we review the salient aspects of recent studies on the biogenesis and function of three classes of small RNAs: miRNAs, siRNAs, and piRNAs. Although the mechanisms are becoming clear by which siRNA-triggered mRNA cleavage silences genes, more studies are needed on several issues regarding miRNA-mediated translation repression. Piwi proteins have been suggested to co-operate in amplifying piRNA biogenesis to maintain transposon silencing in the germ line genome, but details of this process are still unknown as well as the functional consequences of piRNA expression at discrete genomic loci."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a novel class of small noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level and play a critical role in many important biological processes. Most miRNAs are conserved between humans and mice, which makes it possible to analyze their expressions with a set of selected array probes. Here, we report a simple array platform that can detect 553 nonredundant miRNAs encompassing the entire set of miRNAs for humans and mice. The platform features carefully selected and designed probes with optimized hybridization parameters. Potential cross-reaction between mature miRNAs and their precursors was investigated. The array platform was used to analyze miRNAs in the mouse central nervous system (CNS, spinal cord and brain), and two other non-CNS organs (liver and heart). Two types of miRNAs, differentially expressed organ/tissue-associated miRNAs and ubiquitously expressed miRNAs, were detected in the array analysis. In addition to the previously reported neuron-related miR-124a, liver-related miR-122a, and muscle-related miR-133a, we also detected new tissue-associated miRNAs (e.g., liver-associated miR-194). Interestingly, while the majority of pre-miRNAs were undetectable, miR690, miR709, and miR720 were clearly detected at both mature and precursor levels by the array analysis, indicating a limited cross-reaction between pre-miRNAs and their mature miRNAs. The reliability of this array technology was validated by comparing the results with independent Northern blot analyses and published data. A new approach of data normalization based on Northern blot analysis of one ubiquitously expressed miRNA is introduced and compared with traditional approaches. We expect this miRNA array platform to be useful for a wide variety of biological studies."

        "abstract": "Both microRNAs and alternative pre-mRNA splicing have been implicated in the development of the nervous system (NS), but functional interactions between these two pathways are poorly understood. We demonstrate that the neuron-specific microRNA miR-124 directly targets PTBP1 (PTB/hnRNP I) mRNA, which encodes a global repressor of alternative pre-mRNA splicing in nonneuronal cells. Among the targets of PTBP1 is a critical cassette exon in the pre-mRNA of PTBP2 (nPTB/brPTB/PTBLP), an NS-enriched PTBP1 homolog. When this exon is skipped, PTBP2 mRNA is subject to nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). During neuronal differentiation, miR-124 reduces PTBP1 levels, leading to the accumulation of correctly spliced PTBP2 mRNA and a dramatic increase in PTBP2 protein. These events culminate in the transition from non-NS to NS-specific alternative splicing patterns. We also present evidence that miR-124 plays a key role in the differentiation of progenitor cells to mature neurons. Thus, miR-124 promotes NS development, at least in part by regulating an intricate network of NS-specific alternative splicing."

        "abstract": "One recently identified mechanism that regulates mRNA abundance is RNA silencing, and pioneering work in Arabidopsis thaliana and other genetic model organisms helped define this process. RNA silencing pathways are triggered by either self-complementary fold-back structures or the production of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) that gives rise to small RNAs (smRNAs) known as microRNAs (miRNAs) or small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs). These smRNAs direct sequence-specific regulation of various gene transcripts, repetitive sequences, viruses, and mobile elements via RNA cleavage, translational inhibition, or transcriptional silencing through DNA methylation and heterochromatin formation. Early genetic screens in Arabidopsis were instrumental in uncovering numerous proteins required for these important regulatory pathways. Among the factors identified by these studies were RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RDRs), which are proteins that synthesize siRNA-producing dsRNA molecules using a single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) molecule as a template. Recently, a growing body of evidence has implicated RDR-dependent RNA silencing in many different aspects of plant biology ranging from reproductive development to pathogen resistance. Here, we focus on the specific functions of the six Arabidopsis RDRs in RNA silencing, their ssRNA substrates and resulting RDR-dependent smRNAs, and the numerous biological functions of these proteins in plant development and stress responses."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are members of the small non-coding RNAs, which are principally known for their functions as post-transcriptional regulators of target genes. Regulation by miRNAs is triggered by the translational repression or degradation of their complementary target messenger RNAs (mRNAs). The growing number of reported miRNAs and the estimate that hundreds or thousands of genes are regulated by them suggest a magnificent gene regulatory network in which these molecules are embedded. Indeed, recent reports have suggested critical roles for miRNAs in various biological functions, such as cell differentiation, development, oncogenesis, and the immune responses, which are mediated by systems-wide changes in gene expression profiles. Therefore, it is essential to analyze this complex regulatory network at the transcriptome and proteome levels, which should be possible with approaches that include both high-throughput experiments and computational methodologies. Here, we introduce several systems-level approaches that have been applied to miRNA research, and discuss their potential to reveal miRNA-guided gene regulatory systems and their impacts on biological functions."

SiRNAs typically induce endonucleolytic cleavage of mRNA with near-perfect complementarity. For targets with less complementarity, both translational repression and mRNA destabilization mechanisms have been implicated in miRNA-mediated gene repression, although the timing, coupling, and relative importance of these events have not been determined. Here, we review gene-specific and global approaches that probe miRNA function and mechanism, looking for a unifying model. More systematic analyses of the molecular specificities of the core components coupled with analysis of the relative timing of the different events will ultimately shed light on the mechanism of miRNA-mediated repression."

        "abstract": "Designing potent silencing triggers is key to the successful application of RNA interference (RNAi) in mammals. Recent studies suggest that the assembly of RNAi effector complexes is coupled to Dicer cleavage. Here we examine whether transfection of optimized Dicer substrates results in an improved RNAi response. Dicer cleavage of chemically synthesized short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) with 29-base-pair stems and 2-nucleotide 3' overhangs produced predictable homogeneous small RNAs comprising the 22 bases at the 3' end of the stem. Consequently, direct comparisons of synthetic small interfering RNAs and shRNAs that yield the same small RNA became possible. We found synthetic 29-mer shRNAs to be more potent inducers of RNAi than small interfering RNAs. Maximal inhibition of target genes was achieved at lower concentrations and silencing at 24 h was often greater. These studies provide the basis for an improved approach to triggering experimental silencing via the RNAi pathway."

        "abstract": "The Caenorhabditis elegans heterochronic gene lin-14 generates a temporal gradient of the LIN-14 proteins to control stage-specific patterns of cell lineage during development. Down-regulation of LIN-14 is mediated by the lin-14 3' untranslated region (UTR), which bears seven sites that are complementary to the regulatory lin-4 RNA. Here we report molecular and genetic evidence that RNA duplexes between the lin-4 and lin-14 RNAs form in vivo and are necessary for LIN-14 temporal gradient generation. lin-4 RNA binds in vitro to a lin-14 mRNA bearing the seven lin-4 complementary sites but not to a lin-14 mRNA bearing point mutations in these sites. In vivo, the lin-4 complementary regions are necessary for lin-14 3' UTR-mediated temporal gradient formation. Based on lin-14 3' UTR sequence comparisons between C. elegans and C. briggsae, four of the seven lin-4/lin-14 RNA duplexes are predicted to bulge a lin-4 C residue, and three sites are predicted to form nonbulged RNA duplexes. Reporter genes bearing multimerized bulged C lin-4 binding sites show almost wild-type temporal gradient formation, whereas those bearing multimerized nonbulged lin-4 binding sites do not form a temporal gradient. Paradoxically, lin-4 RNA binds in vitro to nonbulged lin-14 RNA more avidly than to the bulged lin-14 RNA. This suggests that a specific secondary structure of lin-4/lin-14 RNA duplex that may be recognized by an accessory protein, rather than an RNA duplex per se, is required in vivo for the generation of the LIN-14 temporal gradient."

        "abstract": "RNA silencing is a central regulator of gene expression in most eukaryotes and acts both at the transcriptional level through DNA methylation and at the post-transcriptional level through direct mRNA interference mediated by small RNAs. In plants and invertebrates, the same pathways also function directly in host defence against viruses by targeting viral RNA for degradation. Successful viruses have consequently evolved diverse mechanisms to avoid silencing, most notably through the expression of viral suppressors of RNA silencing. RNA silencing suppressors have also been recently identified in plant pathogenic bacteria and oomycetes, suggesting that disruption of host silencing is a general virulence strategy across several kingdoms of plant pathogens. There is also increasing evidence that plants have evolved specific defences against RNA-silencing suppression by pathogens, providing yet another illustration of the never-ending molecular arms race between plant pathogens and their hosts."

By directing the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) to bind specific target mRNAs, miRNA can repress target genes and affect various biological phenotypes. Functional miRNA target recognition is known to majorly attribute specificity to consecutive pairing with seed region (position 2-8) of miRNA. Recent advances in a transcriptome-wide method of mapping miRNA binding sites (Ago HITS-CLIP) elucidated that a large portion of miRNA-target interactions in vivo are mediated not only through the canonical \"seed sites\" but also via non-canonical sites (\u223c15-80%), setting the stage to expand and determine their properties. Here we focus on recent findings from transcriptome-wide non-canonical miRNA-target interactions, specifically regarding \"nucleation bulges\" and \"seed-like motifs\". We also discuss insights from Ago HITS-CLIP data alongside structural and biochemical studies, which highlight putative mechanisms of miRNA target recognition, and the biological significance of these non-canonical sites mediating marginal repression."

This discovery opened the field of regulatory RNAs with no or little protein-coding potential. Since then many new classes of regulatory non-coding RNAs, including endogenous small interfering RNAs (endo-siRNAs), PIWI-associated RNAs (piRNAs), and long non-coding RNAs, have been identified and we have made amazing progress in elucidating their expression, biogenesis, mechanisms and mode of action, and function in many, if not all, biological processes.

        "abstract": "Posttranscriptional gene regulation is a regulatory mechanism which occurs \"above the genome\" and confers different phenotypes and functions within a cell. Transcript and protein abundance above the level of transcription can be regulated via noncoding ribonucleic acid (ncRNA) molecules, which potentially play substantial roles in the regulation of reproductive function. MicroRNA (miRNA), endogenous small interfering RNA (endo-siRNA), and PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) are three primary classes of small ncRNA. Similarities and distinctions between their biogenesis and in the interacting protein machinery that facilitate their function distinguish these three classes. Characterization of the expression and importance of the critical components for the biogenesis of each class in different tissues contributes a clearer understanding of their contributions in specific reproductive tissues and their ability to influence fertility in both males and females. This chapter discusses the expression and potential roles of miRNA, endo-siRNA, and piRNA in the regulation of reproductive function. Additionally, this chapter elaborates on investigations aimed to address and characterize specific mechanisms through which miRNA may influence infertility and the use of miRNA as biomarkers associated with several reproductive calamities such as defective spermatogenesis in males, polycystic ovarian failure, endometriosis and obesity, and chemical-induced subfertility."

        "title": "Aberrant regulation and function of microRNAs in cancer.",
        "abstract": "Malignant neoplasms are consistently among the top four leading causes of death in all age groups in the United States, despite a concerted effort toward developing novel therapeutic approaches. Our understanding of and therapeutic strategy for treating each of these neoplastic diseases have been improved through decades of research on the genetics, signaling pathways, and cellular biology that govern tumor cell initiation, progression and maintenance. Much of this work has concentrated on post-translational modifications and abnormalities at the DNA level, including point mutations, amplifications/deletions, and chromosomal translocations, and how these aberrant events affect the expression and function of protein-coding genes. Only recently has a novel class of conserved gene regulatory molecules been identified as a major contributor to malignant neoplastic disease. This review focuses on how these small non-coding RNA molecules, termed microRNAs (miRNAs), can function as oncogenes or tumor suppressors, and how the misexpression of miRNAs and dysregulation of factors that regulate miRNAs contribute to the tumorigenic process. Specific focus is given to more recently discovered regulatory mechanisms that go awry in cancer, and how these changes alter miRNA expression, processing, and function."

They regulate gene expression through posttranscriptional mechanisms to attenuate protein output in various genetic networks. The discovery of miRNAs has transformed our understanding of gene regulation and sparked intense efforts intended to harness their potential as diagnostic markers and therapeutic tools. Over the last decade, a flurry of studies has shed light on placental miRNAs but has also raised many questions regarding the scope of their biologic action. Moreover, the recognition that miRNAs of placental origin are released continually in the maternal circulation throughout pregnancy suggested that circulating miRNAs might serve as biomarkers for placental function during pregnancy. Although this generated much enthusiasm, recently recognized challenges have delayed the application of miRNA-based biomarkers and therapeutics in clinical practice. In this review, we summarize key findings in the field and discuss current knowledge related to miRNAs in the context of placental biology."

Approximately, 18 - 24 nucleotides long, miRNAs can up-regulate or down-regulate gene expression in many cancer types and are respectively categorized as oncogenes (oncomirs) or tumor suppressors. Expression profiles of miRNAs with biomarker potential can be used for the classification, diagnosis, therapeutic treatment, and prognosis of different cancer types. miRNA mimics and miRNA antagonists are the two main approaches to miRNA-based cancer therapies that respectively inhibit oncomirs or restore the expression of tumor suppressive miRNAs.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are currently the best-described class of post-transcriptional regulators that follow a specific biogenesis pathway characterized by Drosha/DGCR8 and Dicer processing. However, more exotic miRNA-like species that bypass particular steps of the canonical miRNA biogenesis pathway continue to emerge, with one of the most recent additions being the agotrons, which escape both Drosha/DGCR8- and Dicer-processing. We review here the current knowledge and most recent discoveries relating to alternative functions and biogenesis strategies for Ago-associated RNAs in mammals."

However, recent developments have revealed that there is also extensive involvement of RNAi-related processes in regulation at the genome level. dsRNA and proteins of the RNAi machinery can direct epigenetic alterations to homologous DNA sequences to induce transcriptional gene silencing or, in extreme cases, DNA elimination. Furthermore, in some organisms RNAi silences unpaired DNA regions during meiosis. These mechanisms facilitate the directed silencing of specific genomic regions."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression in animals and plants. Comparative genomic computational methods have been developed to predict new miRNAs in worms, flies, and humans. Here, we present a novel single genome approach for the detection of miRNAs in Arabidopsis thaliana. This was initiated by producing a candidate miRNA-target data set using an algorithm called findMiRNA, which predicts potential miRNAs within candidate precursor sequences that have corresponding target sites within transcripts. From this data set, we used a characteristic divergence pattern of miRNA precursor families to select 13 potential new miRNAs for experimental verification, and found that corresponding small RNAs could be detected for at least eight of the candidate miRNAs. Expression of some of these miRNAs appears to be under developmental control. Our results are consistent with the idea that targets of miRNAs encompass a wide range of transcripts, including those for F-box factors, ubiquitin conjugases, Leucine-rich repeat proteins, and metabolic enzymes, and that regulation by miRNAs might be widespread in the genome. The entire set of annotated transcripts in the Arabidopsis genome has been run through find MiRNA to yield a data set that will enable identification of potential miRNAs directed against any target gene."

        "abstract": "Conservation of microRNAs (miRNAs) among species suggests that they bear conserved biological functions. However, sequencing of new miRNAs has not always been accompanied by a search for orthologues in other species. I report herein the results of a systematic search for interspecies orthologues of miRNA precursors, leading to the identification of 35 human and 45 mouse new putative miRNA genes. MicroRNA tracks were written to visualize miRNAs in human and mouse genomes on the UCSC Genome Browser. Based on their localization, miRNA precursors can be excised either from introns or exons of mRNAs. When intronic miRNAs are antisense to the apparent host gene, they appear to originate from ill-characterized antisense transcription units. Exonic miRNAs are, in general, nonprotein-coding, poorly conserved genes in sense orientation. In three cases, the excision of an miRNA from a protein-coding mRNA might lead to the degradation of the rest of the transcript. Moreover, three new examples of miRNAs fully complementary to an mRNA are reported. Among these, miR135a might control the stability and/or translation of an alternative form of the glycerate kinase mRNA by RNA interference. I also discuss the presence of human miRNAs in introns of paralogous genes and in miRNA clusters."

They can trigger destruction of homologous mRNA or inhibition of cognate mRNA translation and play an important role in maintaining the stable state of chromosome structure and regulating the expression of protein-coding genes. Furthermore, the recent research showed that there exists close relationship between small RNAs and human diseases. Several human diseases have surfaced in which miRNAs or their machinery might be implicated, such as some neurological diseases and cancers. The specificity and potency of small RNAs suggest that they might be promising as therapeutic agents. This article will review the role of small RNAs in some human diseases etiology and investigations of taking siRNAs as therapeutic tools for treating viral infection, cancer, and other diseases. We also discuss the potential of miRNAs in gene therapy."

MiRNAs have emerged as a new class of regulators of the expression and function of eukaryotic genomes. Tumor suppressive or oncogenic functions have been attributed to some miRNAs. Recent studies have shown that p53 can alter the transcription of several miRNAs, and in some cases, it can also influence miRNA maturation. Conversely, miRNAs can also modulate the abundance and activity of p53 by direct or indirect mechanisms. Moreover, mutant p53 can actively repress the expression of some miRNAs that are activated by wild-type p53. In this review, we discuss recent evidences of this crosstalk between miRNAs and the p53 network and also highlight its implications in cancer."

Understanding how miRNAs silence targeted mRNAs has been the focus of intensive research. Multiple models have been proposed, with few mechanistic details having been worked out. However, the past few years have witnessed a quantum leap forward in our understanding of the molecular mechanics of miRNA-mediated gene silencing. In this review we describe recent discoveries, with an emphasis on how miRISC post-transcriptionally controls gene expression by inhibiting translation and/or initiating mRNA decay, and how trans-acting factors control miRNA action."

        "abstract": "Micro RNAs (miRs) are small noncoding RNAs, functioning as antisense regulators of other RNAs. miR-15a and miR-16-1 genes are located at chromosome 13q14, a region which is frequently deleted in pituitary tumors. An inverse correlation has been shown in B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) between miR-15a and miR-16-1 expression and the expression levels of arginyl-tRNA synthetase (RARS), an enzyme which associates with the cofactor p43 in the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex. When secreted, p43 regulates local inflammatory response and macrophage chemotaxis, and seems to have anti-neoplastic properties in mice. We explored miR-15a and miR-16-1 expression in 10 GH-secreting and in 10 PRL-secreting pituitary macroadenomas by Northern blot, and investigated the possible correlation with in vivo and in vitro characteristics. We found that miR-15a and miR-16-1 are expressed at lower levels in pituitary adenomas as compared to normal pituitary tissue. Moreover, their expression inversely correlates with tumor diameter and with RARS expression (P < 0.05), but directly correlates with p43 secretion (P < 0.02). Therefore, miR15 and miR16 down-regulation in pituitary adenomas correlates with a greater tumor diameter and a lower p43 secretion, suggesting that these genes may, at least in part, influence tumor growth."

        "title": "Small players with big roles: microRNAs as targets to inhibit breast cancer progression.",
        "abstract": "As modulators of gene expression, microRNAs (miRNAs) are essential for normal development. Not surprisingly, aberrant expression of miRNAs is associated with many diseases, including cancer. Studies of various breast cancer subtypes have demonstrated that, like gene expression profiles and pathological differences, miRNA profiles can distinguish various tumor subtypes. Over the last few years, roles for miRNAs during many stages of breast cancer progression have been established. This includes potential breast cancer associated polymorphisms in miRNA target sites or miRNAs themselves, miRNAs that can act as tumor suppressors or oncogenes, and miRNAs that can modulate metastatic spread. Recent studies have also suggested key roles for miRNAs in regulating cancer stem cells. Thus, miRNAs have now become important therapeutic targets. This can be achieved by replacing miRNA expression where it has been lost or decreased, or conversely by inhibiting miRNA expression where it has been amplified or overexpressed in cancers. Ultimately, miRNAs should provide both important prognostic biomarkers as well as new targetable molecules for the treatment of breast cancer."

        "title": "The role of MicroRNA in chemical carcinogenesis.",
        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important regulators of gene expression. Alteration of miRNA expression caused by exposure of different carcinogens has been well reported. This review aims to present the miRNAs dysregulated by exposure of different types of carcinogens in different biological systems and to discuss their potential roles in different stages of chemical carcinogenesis, following an introduction of miRNA biogenesis, regulatory mechanisms, and target identification. Available information shows that expression of a large number of miRNAs is readily changed by exposure of carcinogens in tissue- and chemical-specific manners. Carcinogenic agents generally induce many more changes in miRNA expression than non-carcinogenic chemicals. There are many more changes in cancer-target tissues than in the non-target tissues after acute or chronic exposure to carcinogens. Many of the miRNAs deregulated by carcinogens are involved in regulation of genes that are important for every stage of chemical carcinogenesis, including xenobiotic metabolism, carcinogen-induced hypomethylation, DNA repair, apoptosis, cell proliferation, tumor suppression, cell transformation, oncogenesis, tumor angiogenesis, tumor progress, mangliant transformation, and other functions. Many miRNAs function as putative oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. The carcinogenic functions of carcinogens may be dependent on the balance between tumor-suppressor miRNAs and oncogenic miRNAs. Thus, the miRNA profiles and miRNAs specific to carcinogen exposure have the potential to be used as biomarkers for identifying genotoxicity and carcinogenicity of chemicals and indicating exposure of carcinogens."

        "title": "A structural perspective of the protein-RNA interactions involved in virus-induced RNA silencing and its suppression.",
        "abstract": "Small RNAs, including small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs) and Piwi-associated interfering RNAs (piRNAs), are powerful gene expression regulators. This RNA-mediated regulation results in sequence-specific inhibition of gene expression by translational repression and/or mRNA degradation. siRNAs and miRNAs are generated by RNase III enzymes and subsequently loaded into Argonaute protein, a key component of the RNA induced silencing complex (RISC), to form the core of the RNA silencing machinery. RNA silencing acts as an ancient cell defense system against molecular parasites, such as transgenes, viruses and transposons. RNA silencing also plays an important role in the control of development. In plants, RNA silencing serves as a potent antiviral defense system. In response, many viruses have developed strategies to suppress RNA silencing. The striking sequence diversity among viral suppressors suggests that different viral suppressors could target different components of the RNA silencing machinery at different steps in different suppressing modes. Significant progresses have been made in this field for the past 5 years on the basis of structural information derived from RNase III family proteins, Dicer fragments and homologs, Argonaute homologs and viral suppressors. In this paper, we will review the current progress on the understanding of molecular mechanisms of RNA silencing; highlight the structural principles determining the protein-RNA recognition events along the RNA silencing pathways and the suppression mechanisms displayed by viral suppressors."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) repress hundreds of target messenger RNAs (mRNAs), but the physiological roles of specific miRNA-mRNA interactions remain largely elusive. We report that zebrafish microRNA-430 (miR-430) dampens and balances the expression of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) Nodal agonist squint and the TGF-beta Nodal antagonist lefty. To disrupt the interaction of specific miRNA-mRNA pairs, we developed target protector morpholinos complementary to miRNA binding sites in target mRNAs. Protection of squint or lefty mRNAs from miR-430 resulted in enhanced or reduced Nodal signaling, respectively. Simultaneous protection of squint and lefty or absence of miR-430 caused an imbalance and reduction in Nodal signaling. These findings establish an approach to analyze the in vivo roles of specific miRNA-mRNA pairs and reveal a requirement for miRNAs in dampening and balancing agonist/antagonist pairs."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are evolutionarily conserved, 18- to 25-nucleotide, non-protein coding transcripts that posttranscriptionally regulate gene expression during development. miRNAs also occur in postmitotic cells, such as neurons in the mammalian central nervous system, but their function is less well characterized. We investigated the role of miRNAs in mammalian midbrain dopaminergic neurons (DNs). We identified a miRNA, miR-133b, that is specifically expressed in midbrain DNs and is deficient in midbrain tissue from patients with Parkinson's disease. miR-133b regulates the maturation and function of midbrain DNs within a negative feedback circuit that includes the paired-like homeodomain transcription factor Pitx3. We propose a role for this feedback circuit in the fine-tuning of dopaminergic behaviors such as locomotion."

        "title": "Target RNA-directed trimming and tailing of small silencing RNAs.",
        "abstract": "In Drosophila, microRNAs (miRNAs) typically guide Argonaute1 to repress messenger RNA (mRNA), whereas small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) guide Argonaute2 to destroy viral and transposon RNA. Unlike siRNAs, miRNAs rarely form extensive numbers of base pairs to the mRNAs they regulate. We find that extensive complementarity between a target RNA and an Argonaute1-bound miRNA triggers miRNA tailing and 3'-to-5' trimming. In flies, Argonaute2-bound small RNAs--but not those bound to Argonaute1--bear a 2'-O-methyl group at their 3' ends. This modification blocks target-directed small RNA remodeling: In flies lacking Hen1, the enzyme that adds the 2'-O-methyl group, Argonaute2-associated siRNAs are tailed and trimmed. Target complementarity also affects small RNA stability in human cells. These results provide an explanation for the partial complementarity between animal miRNAs and their targets."

        "abstract": "The miR-17-92 locus encodes a cluster of 7 microRNAs transcribed as a single primary transcript. It can accelerate c-Myc induced B cell lymphoma development and is highly expressed in many tumors, including lung tumors. However, the role of miR-17-92 in development has not been well studied. From analysis of microRNAs during lung development, expression of the miR-17-92 cluster is high at early stages, but declines as development proceeds. We used the mouse surfactant protein C (Sftpc) promoter to over-express the cluster in embryonic lung epithelium. Transgenic lungs have a very abnormal lethal phenotype. They contain numerous proliferative epithelial cells that retain high levels of Sox9, a marker of distal progenitors. The differentiation of proximal epithelial cells was also inhibited. Furthermore, a significant increase in the number of neuroendocrine cell clusters was observed in the lungs of dead transgenic pups. We identify a tumor suppressor, Rbl2 which belongs to the Rb family, as a new target for miR-17-5p. Together, these studies suggest that mir-17-92 normally promotes the high proliferation and undifferentiated phenotype of lung epithelial progenitor cells."

They regulate the expression of a large number of mRNAs in animals and plants through the miRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC). The conserved GW182 family of proteins has recently been identified, and its members have been shown to be associated with miRISC and to be required for miRNA-mediated gene silencing. These proteins have also been localized to processing bodies that are cytoplasmic messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) aggregates containing mRNA decay factors, translational repressors and untranslated mRNAs. Therefore, these properties of GW182 family proteins support the hypothesis that the formation of untranslatable messenger ribonuclear protein particles is one important mechanism of miRNA-mediated gene silencing."

        "abstract": "RNA interference pathways can involve amplification of secondary siRNAs by RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. In plants, RDR6-dependent secondary siRNAs arise from transcripts targeted by some microRNAs (miRNAs). Here, Arabidopsis thaliana secondary siRNAs from mRNA as well as trans-acting siRNAs are shown to be triggered through initial targeting by a 22-nucleotide (nt) miRNA that associates with AGO1. In contrast to canonical 21-nt miRNAs, 22-nt miRNAs primarily arise from foldback precursors containing asymmetric bulges. Using artificial miRNA constructs, conversion of asymmetric foldbacks to symmetric foldbacks resulted in the production of 21-nt forms of miR173, miR472 and miR828. Both 21- and 22-nt forms associated with AGO1 and guided accurate slicer activity, but only 22-nt forms were competent to trigger RDR6-dependent siRNA production from target RNA. These data suggest that AGO1 functions differentially with 21- and 22-nt miRNAs to engage the RDR6-associated amplification apparatus."

The mutations and polymorphisms in the expression levels of miRNA genes or alterations in their epigenetic mechanisms may play their roles in the formation of malignancies. Increasing evidence shows that aberrant miRNA expression profiles are present in a variety of cancers. Therefore, it has been suggested that these profiles could be useful for diagnosis and classification of different tumor types and that these small RNAs might provide significant opportunities for the development of future miRNA-based therapies. In this review, we aimed to look into the realm of miRNAs, which is a recent area of research, appraise their biological activities on molecular level and their probable benefits on clinical practice."

        "title": "MicroRNAs: more than a role in plant development?",
        "abstract": "SUMMARY Eukaryotic small RNA comprises several classes of 21-25 nucleotide non-coding RNA, of which microRNA (miRNA) has gained a great deal of attention because it is directly involved in controlling growth and development in plants. miRNAs are processed by the RNase III-like Dicer, although recent studies have implicated additional gene products in the step-wise maturation of miRNAs from their primary nuclear transcripts. They function as sequence-specific guides to trigger cleavage or translational repression of target mRNAs that have complementary sequences. Natural miRNA targets encode members of large families of transcription factors, which are collectively required for a number of developmental processes. In addition to developmental regulation, some miRNAs might be involved in specific physiological responses to several types of stresses, such as those induced by pathogen infections. Strikingly, the potyviruses, the largest group of plant RNA viruses, are able to interfere with miRNA-guided cleavage of multiple regulatory targets in plants, thus modulating gene expression of the host cell."

        "title": "Ancient endo-siRNA pathways reveal new tricks.",
        "abstract": "Endogenously produced small interfering RNAs (endo-siRNAs, 18-30 nucleotides) play a key role in gene regulatory pathways, guiding Argonaute effector proteins as a part of a functional ribonucleoprotein complex called the RISC (RNA induced silencing complex) to complementarily target nucleic acid. Enabled by the advent of high throughput sequencing, there has been an explosion in the identification of endo-siRNAs in all three kingdoms of life since the discovery of the first microRNA in 1993. Concurrently, our knowledge of the variety of cellular processes in which small RNA pathways related to RNA interference (RNAi) play key regulatory roles has also expanded dramatically. Building on the strong foundation of RNAi established over the past fifteen years, this review uses a historical context to highlight exciting recent developments in endo-siRNA pathways. Specifically, my focus will be on recent insights regarding the Argonaute effectors, their endo-siRNA guides and the functional outputs of these pathways in several model systems that have been longstanding champions of small RNA research. I will also touch on newly discovered roles for bacterial Argonautes, which have been integral in deciphering Argonaute structure and demonstrate key functions of these conserved pathways in genome defense."

        "abstract": "The interplay between abnormalities in genes coding for proteins and noncoding microRNAs (miRNAs) has been among the most exciting yet unexpected discoveries in oncology over the last decade. The complexity of this network has redefined cancer research as miRNAs, produced from what was once considered \"genomic trash,\" have shown to be crucial for cancer initiation, progression, and dissemination. Naturally occurring miRNAs are very short transcripts that never produce a protein or amino acid chain, but act by regulating protein expression during cellular processes such as growth, development, and differentiation at the transcriptional, posttranscriptional, and/or translational level. In this review article, miRNAs are presented as ubiquitous players involved in all cancer hallmarks. The authors also describe the most used methods to detect their expression, which have revealed the identity of hundreds of miRNAs dysregulated in cancer cells or tumor microenvironment cells. Furthermore, the role of miRNAs as hormones and as reliable cancer biomarkers and predictors of treatment response is discussed. Along with this, the authors explore current strategies in designing miRNA-targeting therapeutics, as well as the associated challenges that research envisions to overcome. Finally, a new wave in molecular oncology translational research is introduced: the study of long noncoding RNAs."

        "title": "Widespread regulatory activity of vertebrate microRNA* species.",
        "abstract": "An obligate intermediate during microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis is an ~22-nucleotide RNA duplex, from which the mature miRNA is preferentially incorporated into a silencing complex. Its partner miRNA* species is generally regarded as a passenger RNA, whose regulatory capacity has not been systematically examined in vertebrates. Our bioinformatic analyses demonstrate that a substantial fraction of miRNA* species are stringently conserved over vertebrate evolution, collectively exhibit greatest conservation in their seed regions, and define complementary motifs whose conservation across vertebrate 3'-UTR evolution is statistically significant. Functional tests of 22 miRNA expression constructs revealed that a majority could repress both miRNA and miRNA* perfect match reporters, and the ratio of miRNA:miRNA* sensor repression was correlated with the endogenous ratio of miRNA:miRNA* reads. Analysis of microarray data provided transcriptome-wide evidence for the regulation of seed-matched targets for both mature and star strand species of several miRNAs relevant to oncogenesis, including mir-17, mir-34a, and mir-19. Finally, 3'-UTR sensor assays and mutagenesis tests confirmed direct repression of five miR-19* targets via star seed sites. Overall, our data demonstrate that miRNA* species have demonstrable impact on vertebrate regulatory networks and should be taken into account in studies of miRNA functions and their contribution to disease states."

        "abstract": "Mirtrons are intronic hairpin substrates of the dicing machinery that generate functional microRNAs. In this study, we describe experimental assays that defined the essential requirements for entry of introns into the mirtron pathway. These data informed a bioinformatic screen that effectively identified functional mirtrons from the Drosophila melanogaster transcriptome. These included 17 known and six confident novel mirtrons among the top 51 candidates, and additional candidates had limited read evidence in available small RNA data. Our computational model also proved effective on Caenorhabditis elegans, for which the identification of 14 cloned mirtrons among the top 22 candidates more than tripled the number of validated mirtrons in this species. A few low-scoring introns generated mirtron-like read patterns from atypical RNA structures, but their paucity suggests that relatively few such loci were not captured by our model. Unexpectedly, we uncovered examples of clustered mirtrons in both fly and worm genomes, including a <8-kb region in C. elegans harboring eight distinct mirtrons. Altogether, we demonstrate that discovery of functional mirtrons, unlike canonical miRNAs, is amenable to computational methods independent of evolutionary constraint."

        "abstract": "Since the initial annotation of miRNAs from cloned short RNAs by the Ambros, Tuschl, and Bartel groups in 2001, more than a hundred studies have sought to identify additional miRNAs in various species. We report here a meta-analysis of short RNA data from Drosophila melanogaster, aggregating published libraries with 76 data sets that we generated for the modENCODE project. In total, we began with more than 1 billion raw reads from 187 libraries comprising diverse developmental stages, specific tissue- and cell-types, mutant conditions, and/or Argonaute immunoprecipitations. We elucidated several features of known miRNA loci, including multiple phased byproducts of cropping and dicing, abundant alternative 5' termini of certain miRNAs, frequent 3' untemplated additions, and potential editing events. We also identified 49 novel genomic locations of miRNA production, and 61 additional candidate loci with limited evidence for miRNA biogenesis. Although these loci broaden the Drosophila miRNA catalog, this work supports the notion that a restricted set of cellular transcripts is competent to be specifically processed by the Drosha/Dicer-1 pathway. Unexpectedly, we detected miRNA production from coding and untranslated regions of mRNAs and found the phenomenon of miRNA production from the antisense strand of known loci to be common. Altogether, this study lays a comprehensive foundation for the study of miRNA diversity and evolution in a complex animal model."

        "abstract": "Mature microRNAs (miRNAs) are single-stranded RNA molecules of 20-23-nucleotide (nt) length that control gene expression in many cellular processes. These molecules typically reduce the translation and stability of mRNAs, including those of genes that mediate processes in tumorigenesis, such as inflammation, cell cycle regulation, stress response, differentiation, apoptosis, and invasion. miRNA targeting is initiated through specific base-pairing interactions between the 5' end (\"seed\" region) of the miRNA and sites within coding and untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNAs; target sites in the 3' UTR lead to more effective mRNA destabilization. Since miRNAs frequently target hundreds of mRNAs, miRNA regulatory pathways are complex. To provide a critical overview of miRNA dysregulation in cancer, we first discuss the methods currently available for studying the role of miRNAs in cancer and then review miRNA genomic organization, biogenesis, and mechanism of target recognition, examining how these processes are altered in tumorigenesis. Given the critical role miRNAs play in tumorigenesis processes and their disease specific expression, they hold potential as therapeutic targets and novel biomarkers."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) and transcription factors (TFs) are two major classes of trans-regulators in gene regulatory networks. Coordination between miRNAs and TFs has been demonstrated by individual studies on developmental processes and the pathogenesis of various cancers. Systematic computational approaches have an advantage in elucidating global network features of the miRNA-TF coordinated regulation. miRNAs and TFs have distinct molecular and evolutionary properties. In particular, miRNA genes have a rapid turnover of birth-and-death processes during evolution, and their effects are widespread but modest. Therefore, miRNAs and TFs are considered to have different contributions to their coordination. The miRNA-TF coordinated feedforward circuits are considered to cause significant increases in redundancy but drastically reduce the target gene repertoire, which poses the question, to what extent is miRNA-TF coordination beneficial? Evolutionary analyses provide wide perspectives on the features of miRNA-TF coordinated regulatory networks at a systems level."

        "title": "Mathematical modeling of microRNA-mediated mechanisms of translation repression.",
        "abstract": "MicroRNAs can affect the protein translation using nine mechanistically different mechanisms, including repression of initiation and degradation of the transcript. There is a hot debate in the current literature about which mechanism and in which situations has a dominant role in living cells. The worst, same experimental systems dealing with the same pairs of mRNA and miRNA can provide ambiguous evidences about which is the actual mechanism of translation repression observed in the experiment. We start with reviewing the current knowledge of various mechanisms of miRNA action and suggest that mathematical modeling can help resolving some of the controversial interpretations. We describe three simple mathematical models of miRNA translation that can be used as tools in interpreting the experimental data on the dynamics of protein synthesis. The most complex model developed by us includes all known mechanisms of miRNA action. It allowed us to study possible dynamical patterns corresponding to different miRNA-mediated mechanisms of translation repression and to suggest concrete recipes on determining the dominant mechanism of miRNA action in the form of kinetic signatures. Using computational experiments and systematizing existing evidences from the literature, we justify a hypothesis about co-existence of distinct miRNA-mediated mechanisms of translation repression. The actually observed mechanism will be that acting on or changing the sensitive parameters of the translation process. The limiting place can vary from one experimental setting to another. This model explains the majority of existing controversies reported."

        "abstract": "Over the last decade thousands of microRNAs (miRNAs) have been discovered in all kinds of taxa. The ever growing number of identified miRNA genes required ordered cataloging and annotation. This has led to the development of miRNA web resources.MiRNA web resources can be referred to either as web accessible databases (repositories) or web applications that provide a defined computational task upon user request. Today, more than three dozen web accessible resources exist that gather, organize and annotate all kinds of miRNA related data. According to the type of data or data processing method, these miRNA web resources can be classified as miRNA sequence and annotation databases, resources and tools for predicted as well as experimentally validated targets, databases of miRNA regulation and expression, functional annotation and mapping databases and a number of other tools and resources that are species-specific or focus on particular phenotypes.This chapter provides an overview of the different types of miRNA web resources and their purpose and gives some examples for each category. Furthermore, some valuable miRNA web applications will be introduced. Finally, strategies for miRNA data retrieval and associated risks and pitfalls will be discussed."

        "title": "Working together: combinatorial regulation by microRNAs.",
        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) negatively regulate gene expression level of mRNA post-transcriptionally. Deep sequencing and large-scale screening methods have yielded about 1,500 miRNA sequences in human. Each miRNA contains a seed sequence that is required, but not sufficient, for the correct matching with its targets. Recent technological advances make it possible to capture the miRNAs with their cognate mRNAs at the RISC complex. These experiments have revealed thousands of validated mRNA-miRNA pairing events. In the context of human stem cells, 90% of the identified transcripts appear to be paired with at least two different miRNAs.In this chapter, we present a comprehensive outline for a combinatorial regulation mode by miRNAs. Initially, we summarize the computational and experimental evidence that support a combined effect of multiple miRNAs. Then, we describe miRror2.0, a platform specifically convened to consider the likelihood of miRNAs cooperativity in view of the targets, tissues and cell lines. We show that results from miRror2.0 can be further refined by an iterative procedure, calls Psi-miRror that gauges the robustness of the regulation. We illustrate the combinatorial regulation projected onto graphs of human pathways and show that these pathways are amenable to disruption by a small set of miRNAs. Finally, we propose that miRNA combinatorial regulation is an attractive regulatory strategy not only at the level of single target, but also at the level of pathways and cellular homeostasis. The joint operation of miRNAs is a powerful means to overcome the low specificity inherent in each individual miRNA."

        "title": "Control of developmental timing by micrornas and their targets.",
        "abstract": "In Caenorhabditis elegans the timing of many developmental events is regulated by heterochronic genes. Such genes orchestrate the timing of cell divisions and fates appropriate for the developmental stage of an organism. Analyses of heterochronic mutations in the nematode C. elegans have revealed a genetic pathway that controls the timing of post-embryonic cell divisions and fates. Two of the genes in this pathway encode small regulatory RNAs. The 22 nucleotide (nt) RNAs downregulate the expression of protein-coding mRNAs of target heterochronic genes. Analogous variations in the timing of appearance of particular features have been noted among closely related species, suggesting that such explicit control of developmental timing may not be exclusive to C. elegans. In fact, some of the genes that globally pattern the temporal progression of C. elegans development, including one of the tiny RNA genes, are conserved and temporally regulated across much of animal phylogeny, suggesting that the molecular mechanisms of temporal control are ancient and universal. A very large family of tiny RNA genes called microRNAs, which are similar in structure to the heterochronic regulatory RNAs, have been detected in diverse animal species and are likely to be present in most metazoans. Functions of the newly discovered microRNAs are not yet known. Other examples of temporal programs during growth include the exquisitely choreographed temporal sequences of developmental fates in neurogenesis in Drosophila and the sequential programs of epidermal coloration in insect wing patterning. An interesting possibility is that microRNAs mediate transitions on a variety of time scales to pattern the activities of particular target protein-coding genes and in turn generate sets of cells over a period of time. Plasticity in these microRNA genes or their targets may lead to changes in relative developmental timing between related species, or heterochronic change. Instead of inventing new gene functions, even subtle changes in temporal expression of pre-existing control genes can result in speciation by altering the time at which they function."

        "abstract": "Both transcriptional (TGS) and posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS) are conserved eukaryotic gene regulatory mechanisms, integral for taming exogenous (viruses and bacteria) or endogenous (repetitive elements and transposons) invasive nucleic acids to minimize their impact on genome integrity and function. TGS and PTGS also are essential for controlling the expression of protein coding genes throughout development or in response to environmental stimuli. In plants and animals, at least one member of the conserved ARGONAUTE (AGO) protein family comprises the catalytic engine of the silencing complex, which is guided by sequence-specific small RNA to cognate RNA. In this review, we present general features of plant and animal AGO proteins and detail our knowledge on the 10 Arabidopsis thaliana AGOs."

Here we show that, in human cell extracts, the miRNA let-7 naturally enters the RNAi pathway, which suggests that only the degree of complementarity between a miRNA and its RNA target determines its function. Human let-7 is a component of a previously identified, miRNA-containing ribonucleoprotein particle, which we show is an RNAi enzyme complex. Each let-7-containing complex directs multiple rounds of RNA cleavage, which explains the remarkable efficiency of the RNAi pathway in human cells."

Consequently, misregulation of miRNAs or disruption of their target sites in genes has been implicated in a variety of human diseases ranging from cancer metastasis to neurological disorders. With the development and availability of genomic technologies and computational approaches, the field of miRNA biology has advanced tremendously over the last decade. Here we review the genome-wide approaches that have allowed for the discovery of new miRNAs, the characterization of their targets, and a systems-level view of their impact."

In doing so, they functionally contribute to the maintenance of cellular processes as well as several important features related to cancer development and progression such as cell growth control, differentiation and apoptosis. In fact, recent studies have shown that microRNAs are suitable and effective cancer-related biomarkers since they display altered expression profiles in cancers versus normal tissue. In addition, microRNAs have been associated with cancer progression and outcome. In this review, the current state of knowledge microRNA expression and function in relation to gastroenterological cancers will be addressed. Moreover, the mechanisms to alter their expression and the potential application of microRNAs in clinical settings will also be highlighted. Finally, the challenges involved in translating microRNA research to the clinic will be discussed."

        "abstract": "We sequenced approximately 400,000 small RNAs from Caenorhabditis elegans. Another 18 microRNA (miRNA) genes were identified, thereby extending to 112 our tally of confidently identified miRNA genes in C. elegans. Also observed were thousands of endogenous siRNAs generated by RNA-directed RNA polymerases acting preferentially on transcripts associated with spermatogenesis and transposons. In addition, a third class of nematode small RNAs, called 21U-RNAs, was discovered. 21U-RNAs are precisely 21 nucleotides long, begin with a uridine 5'-monophosphate but are diverse in their remaining 20 nucleotides, and appear modified at their 3'-terminal ribose. 21U-RNAs originate from more than 5700 genomic loci dispersed in two broad regions of chromosome IV-primarily between protein-coding genes or within their introns. These loci share a large upstream motif that enables accurate prediction of additional 21U-RNAs. The motif is conserved in other nematodes, presumably because of its importance for producing these diverse, autonomously expressed, small RNAs (dasRNAs)."

        "title": "A diverse and evolutionarily fluid set of microRNAs in Arabidopsis thaliana.",
        "abstract": "To better understand the diversity of small silencing RNAs expressed in plants, we employed high-throughput pyrosequencing to obtain 887,000 reads corresponding to Arabidopsis thaliana small RNAs. They represented 340,000 unique sequences, a substantially greater diversity than previously obtained in any species. Most of the small RNAs had the properties of heterochromatic small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) associated with DNA silencing in that they were preferentially 24 nucleotides long and mapped to intergenic regions. Their density was greatest in the proximal and distal pericentromeric regions, with only a slightly preferential propensity to match repetitive elements. Also present were 38 newly identified microRNAs (miRNAs) and dozens of other plausible candidates. One miRNA mapped within an intron of DICER-LIKE 1 (DCL1), suggesting a second homeostatic autoregulatory mechanism for DCL1 expression; another defined the phase for siRNAs deriving from a newly identified trans-acting siRNA gene (TAS4); and two depended on DCL4 rather than DCL1 for their accumulation, indicating a second pathway for miRNA biogenesis in plants. More generally, our results revealed the existence of a layer of miRNA-based control beyond that found previously that is evolutionarily much more fluid, employing many newly emergent and diverse miRNAs, each expressed in specialized tissues or at low levels under standard growth conditions."

        "abstract": "Post-transcriptional processes have a central role in the regulation of eukaryotic gene expression. Although it has been known for a long time that these processes are functionally linked, often by the use of common protein factors, it has only recently become apparent that many of these processes are also physically connected. Indeed, proteins that are involved in mRNA degradation, translational repression, mRNA surveillance and RNA-mediated gene silencing, together with their mRNA targets, colocalize within discrete cytoplasmic domains known as P bodies. The available evidence indicates that P bodies are sites where mRNAs that are not being translated accumulate, the information carried by associated proteins and regulatory RNAs is integrated, and their fate - either translation, silencing or decay - is decided."

        "abstract": "Although many miRNAs are deeply conserved within each kingdom, none are known to be conserved between plants and animals. We identified Arabidopsis thaliana miR854 and miR855, two microRNAs (miRNAs) with multiple binding sites in the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of OLIGOURIDYLATE binding PROTEIN1b (At UBP1b), forming miRNA:mRNA interactions similar to those that cause translational repression/mRNA cleavage in animals. At UBP1b encodes a member of a heterogeneous nuclear RNA binding protein (hnRNP) family. The 3'UTR of At UBP1b is sufficient to repress reporter protein expression in tissues expressing miR854 or miR855 (rosette leaves and flowers, respectively) but not where both miRNAs are absent (cauline leaves). Intergenic regions containing sequences closely resembling miR854 are predicted to fold into stable miRNA precursors in animals, and members of the miR854 family are expressed in Caenorhabditis elegans, Mus musculus, and Homo sapiens, all with imperfect binding sites in the 3'UTR of genes encoding the T cell Intracellular Antigen-Related protein, an hnRNP of the UBP1 family. Potential binding sites for miR854 are absent from UBP1-like genes in fungi lacking the miRNA biogenetic machinery. Our results indicate that plants and animals share miRNAs of the miR854 family, suggesting a common origin of these miRNAs as regulators of basal transcriptional mechanisms."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have quite recently emerged as a novel class of gene regulators. Many miRNAs exhibit altered expression levels in cancer, and we are only starting to understand the functional consequences of the loss or gain of particular miRNAs to the cancerous phenotype. miRNAs can be classified with regard to their role in cancer as the Good, the Bad and the Ugly. The \"Good\", those miRNAs that are innocent bystanders in the oncogenic transformation process, whose expression profile might even be used for cancer diagnosis or prognosis. The \"Bad\", those miRNAs that are causally linked to tumorigenesis and directly modify tumor suppressor- or oncogenic- pathways. And the \"Ugly\", those miRNAs whose inappropriate loss or gain destabilizes the cellular identity of a tumor, which indirectly results in enhanced phenotypic variability and progression of the tumor. Hereunder we will discuss the possible ways in which miRNAs can be relevant to cancer biology, and possible experimental strategies for elucidating the mechanisms involved."

A growing number of reports have shown that aberrant miRNA expression is a common feature of human diseases including cancer, which has sparked interest in targeting these regulators of gene expression as a means of ameliorating these diseases. Here, we review important aspects of miRNA function in normal and pathological states and discuss new modalities of epigenetic intervention strategies that could be used to amend defects in miRNA/mRNA interactions."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs are approximately 21-nucleotide-long regulators of gene expression that gain access to their target mRNAs by complementary base pairing. Recent studies have revealed that animal microRNAs might take diverse routes to repress gene expression, affecting both target mRNA levels and translation. Mechanistic details of microRNA-mediated repression are starting to emerge but a comprehensive picture of the inhibition, and particularly the effects on mRNA translation, is still lacking. Recent data support different microRNA mechanisms and a role for cytoplasmic processing bodies in the degradation and storage of mRNAs targeted by microRNA regulators."

        "abstract": "Several thousand human genes, amounting to about one-third of the whole genome, are potential targets for regulation by the several hundred microRNAs (miRNAs) encoded in the genome. The regulation occurs posttranscriptionally and involves the approximately 21-nucleotide miRNA interacting with a target site in the mRNA that generally has imperfect complementarity to the miRNA. The target sites are almost invariably in the 3'-untranslated region of the messenger RNA (mRNA), often in multiple copies. Metazoan miRNAs were previously thought to down-regulate protein expression by inhibiting target mRNA translation at some stage after the translation initiation step, without much effect on mRNA abundance. However, recent studies have questioned these suppositions. With some targets, an increase in the rate of mRNA degradation by the normal decay pathway contributes to the decrease in protein expression. miRNAs can also inhibit translation initiation, specifically the function of the cap-binding initiation factor, eIF4E. Repressed target mRNAs as well as miRNAs themselves accumulate in cytoplasmic foci known as P-bodies, where many enzymes involved in mRNA degradation are concentrated. However, P-bodies may also serve as repositories for the temporary and reversible storage of untranslated mRNA, and reducing the expression (knockdown) of several distinct P-body protein components can alleviate miRNA-mediated repression of gene expression."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an abundant class of tiny RNAs thought to regulate the expression of protein-coding genes in plants and animals. In the present study, we describe a computational procedure to identify miRNA genes conserved in more than one genome. Applying this program, known as MiRscan, together with molecular identification and validation methods, we have identified most of the miRNA genes in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. The total number of validated miRNA genes stands at 88, with no more than 35 genes remaining to be detected or validated. These 88 miRNA genes represent 48 gene families; 46 of these families (comprising 86 of the 88 genes) are conserved in Caenorhabditis briggsae, and 22 families are conserved in humans. More than a third of the worm miRNAs, including newly identified members of the lin-4 and let-7 gene families, are differentially expressed during larval development, suggesting a role for these miRNAs in mediating larval developmental transitions. Most are present at very high steady-state levels-more than 1000 molecules per cell, with some exceeding 50,000 molecules per cell. Our census of the worm miRNAs and their expression patterns helps define this class of noncoding RNAs, lays the groundwork for functional studies, and provides the tools for more comprehensive analyses of miRNA genes in other species."

Using a Drosophila in vitro system, we demonstrate that 21- and 22-nt RNA fragments are the sequence-specific mediators of RNAi. The short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are generated by an RNase III-like processing reaction from long dsRNA. Chemically synthesized siRNA duplexes with overhanging 3' ends mediate efficient target RNA cleavage in the lysate, and the cleavage site is located near the center of the region spanned by the guiding siRNA. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the direction of dsRNA processing determines whether sense or antisense target RNA can be cleaved by the siRNA-protein complex."

        "abstract": "Alterations in microRNA (miRNA) and other short or long non-coding RNA (ncRNA) are involved in the initiation, progression, and metastasis of human cancer. The main molecular alterations result from variations in gene expression, which are usually minor but have consequences for a vast number of target protein-coding genes. The causes of the widespread differential expression of ncRNAs in malignant cells compared with normal cells can be explained by the location of these genes in genomic regions associated with cancer, by epigenetic mechanisms, and by alterations in the processing machinery. Expression profiling of human tumors based on the expression of miRNAs and other short or long ncRNAs has identified signatures associated with diagnosis, staging, progression, prognosis, and response to treatment. In addition, profiling has been exploited to identify ncRNAs that may represent downstream targets of activated oncogenic pathways or that target protein-coding genes involved in cancer. Recent studies found that miRNAs and non-coding ultraconserved genes are the main candidates for the elusive class of cancer-predisposing genes and that other types of ncRNAs participate in the genetic puzzle that gives rise to the malignant phenotype. These discoveries could be exploited for the development of useful markers for diagnosis and prognosis in cancer, as well as for the development of new RNA-based cancer therapies."

In Arabidopsis, perception of flagellin increases resistance to the bacterium Pseudomonas syringae, although the molecular mechanisms involved remain elusive. Here, we show that a flagellin-derived peptide induces a plant microRNA (miRNA) that negatively regulates messenger RNAs for the F-box auxin receptors TIR1, AFB2, and AFB3. Repression of auxin signaling restricts P. syringae growth, implicating auxin in disease susceptibility and miRNA-mediated suppression of auxin signaling in resistance."

A large proportion of isomiRs potentially derive from AGO2 cleavage independent of Dicer. We isolated polyribosome-associated mRNA, captured the mRNA-bound miRNAs, and found that isomiRs and canonical miRNAs are equally associated with translational machinery. Finally, we transfected cells with biotinylated RNA duplexes encoding isomiRs or their canonical counterparts and directly assayed their mRNA targets.

In addition, recent studies suggest the involvement of miRNAs in the initiation and progression of cancer. miR155 and BIC, its host gene, have been reported to accumulate in human B cell lymphomas, especially in diffuse large B cell lymphomas, Hodgkin lymphomas, and certain types of Burkitt lymphomas.

        "abstract": "The term non-coding RNA (ncRNA) is commonly employed for RNA that does not encode a protein, but this does not mean that such RNAs do not contain information nor have function. Although it has been generally assumed that most genetic information is transacted by proteins, recent evidence suggests that the majority of the genomes of mammals and other complex organisms is in fact transcribed into ncRNAs, many of which are alternatively spliced and/or processed into smaller products. These ncRNAs include microRNAs and snoRNAs (many if not most of which remain to be identified), as well as likely other classes of yet-to-be-discovered small regulatory RNAs, and tens of thousands of longer transcripts (including complex patterns of interlacing and overlapping sense and antisense transcripts), most of whose functions are unknown. These RNAs (including those derived from introns) appear to comprise a hidden layer of internal signals that control various levels of gene expression in physiology and development, including chromatin architecture/epigenetic memory, transcription, RNA splicing, editing, translation and turnover. RNA regulatory networks may determine most of our complex characteristics, play a significant role in disease and constitute an unexplored world of genetic variation both within and between species."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenously expressed RNAs, 18-25 nucleotides in length, that repress protein translation through binding to target mRNAs. miRNAs have been implicated in many cellular processes including cell proliferation, differentiation, and death. Recently, let-7 miRNAs were found to regulate human RAS oncogene expression and to be often down-regulated in human lung tumors. In this study, we examined the expression of let-7 miRNAs in human colon cancer tumors and cell lines, with the result that 2 of 6 cases and 1 of 3 cell lines showed reduced expression of let-7. When let-7 low-expressing DLD-1 human colon cancer cells were transfected with let-7a-1 precursor miRNA, which is located at chromosome 9q22.3, the cells underwent significant growth suppression. At that time, the levels of RAS and c-myc proteins were lowered after the transfection, whereas the levels of both of their mRNAs remained almost unchanged. These findings suggest the involvement of let-7 miRNA in the growth of colon cancer cells. Thus, miRNAs might provide a basis for novel RNA anti-cancer agents."

        "abstract": "We have investigated the role of trigger RNA amplification during RNA interference (RNAi) in Caenorhabditis elegans. Analysis of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) produced during RNAi in C. elegans revealed a substantial fraction that cannot derive directly from input dsRNA. Instead, a population of siRNAs (termed secondary siRNAs) appeared to derive from the action of a cellular RNA-directed RNA polymerase (RdRP) on mRNAs that are being targeted by the RNAi mechanism. The distribution of secondary siRNAs exhibited a distinct polarity (5'-->3' on the antisense strand), suggesting a cyclic amplification process in which RdRP is primed by existing siRNAs. This amplification mechanism substantially augments the potency of RNAi-based surveillance, while ensuring that the RNAi machinery will focus on expressed mRNAs."

        "abstract": "In eukaryotes, double-stranded (ds) RNA induces sequence-specific inhibition of gene expression, referred to as RNA interference (RNAi). In invertebrates, RNAi can be triggered effectively by either long dsRNAs or 21- to 23-nt-long short interfering (si) duplex RNAs, acting as effectors of RNAi. siRNAs recently have been shown to act as potent inducers of RNAi in cultured mammalian cells. However, studies of RNAi activated by long dsRNA are impeded by its nonspecific effects, mediated by dsRNA-dependent protein kinase PKR and RNase L. Here, we report that the RNAi response can be induced effectively by long dsRNA in nondifferentiated mouse cells grown in culture. Transfection of dsRNA into embryonal carcinoma (EC) P19 and F9 cells results in a sequence-specific decrease in the level of proteins expressed from either exogenous or endogenous genes. dsRNA-mediated inhibition of the reporter gene also occurs in mouse embryonic stem cells. The RNAi effect is mediated by siRNAs, which are generated by cleavage of dsRNA by the RNaseIII-like enzyme, Dicer. We demonstrate that extracts prepared from EC cells catalyze processing of dsRNA into approximately 23-nt fragments and that Dicer localizes to the cytoplasm of EC and HeLa cells."

        "title": "New microRNAs from mouse and human.",
        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) represent a new class of noncoding RNAs encoded in the genomes of plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates. MicroRNAs regulate translation and stability of target mRNAs based on (partial) sequence complementarity. Although the number of newly identified miRNAs is still increasing, target mRNAs of animal miRNAs remain to be identified. Here we describe 31 novel miRNAs that were identified by cloning from mouse tissues and the human Saos-2 cell line. Fifty-three percent of all known mouse and human miRNAs have homologs in Fugu rubripes (pufferfish) or Danio rerio (zebrafish), of which almost half also have a homolog in Caenorhabditis elegans or Drosophila melanogaster. Because of the recurring identification of already known miRNAs and the unavoidable background of ribosomal RNA breakdown products, it is believed that not many more miRNAs may be identified by cloning. A comprehensive collection of miRNAs is important for assisting bioinformatics target mRNA identification and comprehensive genome annotation."

        "title": "Numerous microRNPs in neuronal cells containing novel microRNAs.",
        "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a common neurodegenerative disease that is caused by deletions or loss-of-function mutations in the Survival of Motor Neuron (SMN) protein. SMN is part of a large complex that functions in the assembly/restructuring of ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes. We recently showed in HeLa cells that two components of the SMN complex, Gemin3 and Gemin4, together with the argonaute protein eIF2C2, also associate with microRNAs (miRNAs) as part of a novel class of RNPs termed miRNPs. Here we report on miRNPs isolated from neuronal cell lines of mouse and human, and describe 53 novel miRNAs. Several of these miRNAs are conserved in divergent organisms, including rat, zebrafish, pufferfish, and the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. The chromosomal locations of most of the novel miRNAs were identified and indicate some phylogenetic conservation of the likely precursor structures. Interestingly the gene locus of one miRNA, miR-175, is a candidate region for two neurologic diseases: early-onset parkinsonism (Waisman syndrome) and X-linked mental retardation (MRX3). Also, several miRNAs identified as part of miRNPs in these cells appear to constitute two distinct subfamilies. These subfamilies comprise multiple copies of miRNAs on different chromosomes, suggesting an important function in the regulation of gene expression."

        "title": "Sequence requirements for micro RNA processing and function in human cells.",
        "abstract": "Most eukaryotes encode a substantial number of small noncoding RNAs termed micro RNAs (miRNAs). Previously, we have demonstrated that miR-30, a 22-nucleotide human miRNA, can be processed from a longer transcript bearing the proposed miR-30 stem-loop precursor and can translationally inhibit an mRNA-bearing artificial target sites. We also demonstrated that the miR-30 precursor stem can be substituted with a heterologous stem, which can be processed to yield novel miRNAs and can block the expression of endogenous mRNAs. Here, we show that a second human miRNA, termed miR-21, can also be effectively expressed when its precursor forms part of a longer mRNA. For both miR-30 and miR-21, mature miRNA production was highly dependent on the integrity of the precursor RNA stem, although the underlying sequence had little effect. In contrast, the sequence of the terminal loop affected miRNA production only moderately. Processing of the initial, miR-30-containing transcript led to the production of not only mature miR-30 but also to the largely nuclear excision of an approximately 65-nucleotide RNA that is likely to represent an important intermediate in miR-30 processing. Consistent with this hypothesis, mutations that affected mature miR-30 production inhibited expression of this miR-30 pre-miRNA to an equivalent degree. Although point mutations could block the ability of both miR-30 and miR-21 to inhibit the translation of mRNAs bearing multiple artificial miRNA target sites, single point mutations only attenuated the miRNA-mediated inhibition of genes bearing single, fully complementary targets. These results suggest that miRNAs, and the closely similar small interfering RNAs, cannot totally discriminate between RNA targets differing by a single nucleotide."

        "abstract": "In Arabidopsis, microRNA-directed cleavage can define one end of RNAs that then generate phased siRNAs. However, most miRNA-targeted RNAs do not spawn siRNAs, suggesting the existence of additional determinants within those that do. We find that in moss, phased siRNAs arise from regions flanked by dual miR390 cleavage sites. AtTAS3, an siRNA locus important for development and conserved among higher plants, also has dual miR390 complementary sites. Both sites bind miR390 in vitro and are functionally required in Arabidopsis, but cleavage is undetectable at the 5' site--demonstrating that noncleavable sites can be functional in plants. Phased siRNAs also emanate from the bounded regions of every Arabidopsis gene with two known microRNA/siRNA complementary sites, but only rarely from genes with single sites. Therefore, two \"hits,\"--often, but not always, two cleavage events--constitute a conserved trigger for siRNA biogenesis, a finding with implications for recognition and silencing of aberrant RNA."

        "abstract": "Early in development, primordial germ cells (PGCs) are set aside from somatic cells and acquire a unique gene-expression program . The mechanisms underlying germline-specific gene expression are largely unknown. Nanos expression is required during germline development and is posttranscriptionally restricted to PGCs . Here we report that the microRNA miR-430 targets the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of nanos1 during zebrafish embryogenesis. A miR-430 target site within the nanos1 3' UTR reduces poly(A) tail length, mRNA stability, and translation. Repression is disrupted in maternal-zygotic dicer mutants (MZdicer), which lack mature miRNAs , and is restored by injection of processed miR-430. Although miR-430 represses other genes equally in germline and soma, specific regions in the nanos1 3' UTR compensate for microRNA-mediated repression in PGCs and allow germline-specific expression. We show that the 3' UTR of an additional PGC-specific gene, TDRD7, is also targeted by miR-430. These results indicate that miR-430 targets the 3' UTRs of germline genes and suggest that differential susceptibility to microRNAs contributes to tissue-specific gene expression."

        "abstract": "Like other eukaryotes, plants use DICER-LIKE (DCL) proteins as the central enzymes of RNA silencing, which regulates gene expression and mediates defense against viruses. But why do plants like Arabidopsis express four DCLs, a diversity unmatched by other kingdoms? Here we show that two nuclear DNA viruses (geminivirus CaLCuV and pararetrovirus CaMV) and a cytoplasmic RNA tobamovirus ORMV are differentially targeted by subsets of DCLs. DNA virus-derived small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) of specific size classes (21, 22 and 24 nt) are produced by all four DCLs, including DCL1, known to process microRNA precursors. Specifically, DCL1 generates 21 nt siRNAs from the CaMV leader region. In contrast, RNA virus infection is mainly affected by DCL4. While the four DCLs are partially redundant for CaLCuV-induced mRNA degradation, DCL4 in conjunction with RDR6 and HEN1 specifically facilitates extensive virus-induced silencing in new growth. Additionally, we show that CaMV infection impairs processing of endogenous RDR6-derived double-stranded RNA, while ORMV prevents HEN1-mediated methylation of small RNA duplexes, suggesting two novel viral strategies of silencing suppression. Our work highlights the complexity of virus interaction with host silencing pathways and suggests that DCL multiplicity helps mediate plant responses to diverse viral infections."

They exist in animals, plants, and viruses, and play an important role in gene silencing.

Many miRNAs are highly conserved in animals and plants, suggesting that they play an essential function in plants and animals. Lots of investigations indicate that miRNAs are involved in multiple biological processes, including stem cell differentiation, organ development, phase change, signaling, disease, cancer, and response to biotic and abiotic environmental stresses.

        "abstract": "Prior work demonstrates that mammalian microRNA (miRNA or miR) expression requires RNA polymerase II (Pol II). However, the transcriptional requirements of many miRNAs remain untested. Our genomic analysis of miRNAs in the human chromosome 19 miRNA cluster (C19MC) revealed that they are interspersed among Alu repeats. Because Alu transcription occurs through RNA Pol III recruitment, and we found that Alu elements upstream of C19MC miRNAs retain sequences important for Pol III activity, we tested the promoter requirements of C19MC miRNAs. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and cell-free transcription assays showed that Pol III, but not Pol II, is associated with miRNA genomic sequence and sufficient for transcription. Moreover, the mature miRNA sequences of approximately 50 additional human miRNAs lie within Alu and other known repetitive elements. These findings extend the current view of miRNA origins and the transcriptional machinery driving their expression."

        "abstract": "Short RNAs mediate gene silencing, a process associated with virus resistance, developmental control and heterochromatin formation in eukaryotes. RNA silencing is initiated through Dicer-mediated processing of double-stranded RNA into small interfering RNA (siRNA). The siRNA guide strand associates with the Argonaute protein in silencing effector complexes, recognizes complementary sequences and targets them for silencing. The PAZ domain is an RNA-binding module found in Argonaute and some Dicer proteins and its structure has been determined in the free state. Here, we report the 2.6 A crystal structure of the PAZ domain from human Argonaute eIF2c1 bound to both ends of a 9-mer siRNA-like duplex. In a sequence-independent manner, PAZ anchors the 2-nucleotide 3' overhang of the siRNA-like duplex within a highly conserved binding pocket, and secures the duplex by binding the 7-nucleotide phosphodiester backbone of the overhang-containing strand and capping the 5'-terminal residue of the complementary strand. On the basis of the structure and on binding assays, we propose that PAZ might serve as an siRNA-end-binding module for siRNA transfer in the RNA silencing pathway, and as an anchoring site for the 3' end of guide RNA within silencing effector complexes."

The structures reveal a unique mode of single-stranded nucleic acid binding in which the two 3'-terminal nucleotides are buried in a hydrophobic cleft.

        "abstract": "The siRNA-directed ribonucleoprotein complex, RISC, catalyzes target RNA cleavage in the RNA interference pathway. Here, we show that siRNA-programmed RISC is a classical Michaelis-Menten enzyme in the presence of ATP. In the absence of ATP, the rate of multiple rounds of catalysis is limited by release of the cleaved products from the enzyme. Kinetic analysis suggests that different regions of the siRNA play distinct roles in the cycle of target recognition, cleavage, and product release. Bases near the siRNA 5' end disproportionately contribute to target RNA-binding energy, whereas base pairs formed by the central and 3' regions of the siRNA provide a helical geometry required for catalysis. Finally, the position of the scissile phosphate on the target RNA seems to be determined during RISC assembly, before the siRNA encounters its RNA target."

        "abstract": "Double-stranded (ds) RNA can induce sequence-specific inhibition of gene function in several organisms. However, both the mechanism and the physiological role of the interference process remain mysterious. In order to study the interference process, we have selected C. elegans mutants resistant to dsRNA-mediated interference (RNAi). Two loci, rde-1 and rde-4, are defined by mutants strongly resistant to RNAi but with no obvious defects in growth or development. We show that rde-1 is a member of the piwi/sting/argonaute/zwille/eIF2C gene family conserved from plants to vertebrates. Interestingly, several, but not all, RNAi-deficient strains exhibit mobilization of the endogenous transposons. We discuss implications for the mechanism of RNAi and the possibility that one natural function of RNAi is transposon silencing."

        "abstract": "While all known natural isolates of C. elegans contain multiple copies of the Tc1 transposon, which are active in the soma, Tc1 transposition is fully silenced in the germline of many strains. We mutagenized one such silenced strain and isolated mutants in which Tc1 had been activated in the germline (\"mutators\"). Interestingly, many other transposons of unrelated sequence had also become active. Most of these mutants are resistant to RNA interference (RNAi). We found one of the mutated genes, mut-7, to encode a protein with homology to RNaseD. This provides support for the notion that RNAi works by dsRNA-directed, enzymatic RNA degradation. We propose a model in which MUT-7, guided by transposon-derived dsRNA, represses transposition by degrading transposon-specific messengers, thus preventing transposase production and transposition."

Here, three types of transgene-induced PTGS and one example of virus-induced PTGS were analyzed in plants. In each case, antisense RNA complementary to the targeted mRNA was detected. These RNA molecules were of a uniform length, estimated at 25 nucleotides, and their accumulation required either transgene sense transcription or RNA virus replication. Thus, the 25-nucleotide antisense RNA is likely synthesized from an RNA template and may represent the specificity determinant of PTGS."

        "abstract": "Micro-RNAs (miR genes) are a large family of highly conserved noncoding genes thought to be involved in temporal and tissue-specific gene regulation. MiRs are transcribed as short hairpin precursors ( approximately 70 nt) and are processed into active 21- to 22-nt RNAs by Dicer, a ribonuclease that recognizes target mRNAs via base-pairing interactions. Here we show that miR15 and miR16 are located at chromosome 13q14, a region deleted in more than half of B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemias (B-CLL). Detailed deletion and expression analysis shows that miR15 and miR16 are located within a 30-kb region of loss in CLL, and that both genes are deleted or down-regulated in the majority ( approximately 68%) of CLL cases."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are noncoding RNAs whose hallmarks are the very short sequences and the ability to repress the translation and/or transcription of target genes. miRNAs can have diverse functions, including regulation of cellular differentiation, proliferation, and embryogenesis. Over the past 5 years, an increasing number of studies have linked different miRNAs with programmed cell death or apoptosis. The principal aim of this chapter is to describe a method that (1) identifies miRNAs involved in apoptosis, using a validated array profiling approach, (2) assesses the direct involvement of candidate miRNAs in apoptosis, and (3) identifies the molecular mechanisms possibly involved in apoptotic response. To disclose the possible molecular targets of miRNAs, we propose the generation of a database created using a list of presumptive miRNA targets and the changes in the transcriptome after ectopic expression of the miRNAs. Our proposed method for doing this is suitable for both discovery of apoptotic pathways that regulate miRNAs and finding new miRNAs able to induce apoptosis."

        "title": "Modulation of microRNA processing by p53.",
        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as key post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression, involved in diverse physiological and pathological processes. Although miRNAs can function as both tumour suppressors and oncogenes in tumour development, a widespread downregulation of miRNAs is commonly observed in human cancers and promotes cellular transformation and tumorigenesis. This indicates an inherent significance of small RNAs in tumour suppression. However, the connection between tumour suppressor networks and miRNA biogenesis machineries has not been investigated in depth. Here we show that a central tumour suppressor, p53, enhances the post-transcriptional maturation of several miRNAs with growth-suppressive function, including miR-16-1, miR-143 and miR-145, in response to DNA damage. In HCT116 cells and human diploid fibroblasts, p53 interacts with the Drosha processing complex through the association with DEAD-box RNA helicase p68 (also known as DDX5) and facilitates the processing of primary miRNAs to precursor miRNAs. We also found that transcriptionally inactive p53 mutants interfere with a functional assembly between Drosha complex and p68, leading to attenuation of miRNA processing activity. These findings suggest that transcription-independent modulation of miRNA biogenesis is intrinsically embedded in a tumour suppressive program governed by p53. Our study reveals a previously unrecognized function of p53 in miRNA processing, which may underlie key aspects of cancer biology."

Since its recent discovery, RNA silencing has become a fast moving key area of research in plant and animal molecular biology. Research in this field has greatly profited from recent developments in novel sequencing technologies that allow massive parallel sequencing of small RNA (sRNA) molecules, the key players of all RNA silencing phenomena. As researchers are beginning to decipher the complexity of RNA silencing, novel methodologies have to be developed to make sense of the large amounts of data that are currently being generated. In this review we present an overview of RNA silencing pathways in plants and the current challenges in analysing sRNA data, with a special focus on computational approaches."

Here we review the intersection of these two exciting fields. While microRNAs are not required for the establishment and maintenance of pluripotency in early development and cell culture, respectively, they are critically important in the regulation of the cell cycle structure of pluripotent stem cells as well as the silencing of the pluripotency program upon differentiation. Pluripotent cells, both in vivo and in vitro, dominantly express a single family of microRNAs, which can promote the reprogramming of a somatic cell back to a pluripotent state. Here, we review the known mechanisms by which these and other microRNAs regulate the different aspects of the pluripotent stem cell program in both mouse and human."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNAs that control gene expression through silencing of target mRNAs. Mature miRNAs are processed from primary miRNA transcripts by the endonuclease activity of the DICER-LIKE1 (DCL1) protein complex. Mechanisms exist that allow the DCL1 complex to precisely excise the miRNA from its precursor. Our understanding of miRNA biogenesis, particularly its intersection with transcription and other aspects of RNA metabolism such as splicing, is still evolving. Mature miRNAs are incorporated into an ARGONAUTE (AGO) effector complex competent for target gene silencing but are also subjected to turnover through a degradation mechanism that is beginning to be understood. The mechanisms of miRNA target silencing in plants are no longer limited to AGO-catalyzed slicing, and the contribution of translational inhibition is increasingly appreciated. Here, we review the mechanisms underlying the biogenesis, turnover, and activities of plant miRNAs."

        "abstract": "RNA interference (RNAi) and related processes serve as a nucleic-acid-mediated surveillance system conserved in almost all eukaryotic organisms. This surveillance system detects various forms of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) in cells and initiates a cascade of events that degrades dsRNAs into small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) or microRNAs (miRNAs). These small RNAs in turn serve as sequence-specific guides to interfere with the function of other nucleic acids through degradation or translational repression of homologous RNAs, or modification of homologous genome segments. One of the major roles of RNAi in plants and invertebrates is antiviral defense. Conversely, viruses have also evolved to encode suppressors of RNAi (VSRs), which disrupt RNAi at various steps. Research activities focusing on the relationship between plant viruses and RNAi have been essential to our current understanding of RNAi mechanisms."

For many years, this has overshadowed the true versatility and importance of these enzymes in the processing of other RNA substrates. For example, Drosha also recognizes and cleaves messenger RNAs (mRNAs), and potentially ribosomal RNA. The cleavage of mRNAs occurs via recognition of secondary stem-loop structures similar to miRNA precursors, and is an important mechanism of repressing gene expression, particularly in progenitor/stem cell populations. On the other hand, Dicer also has critical roles in genome regulation and surveillance. These include the production of endogenous small interfering RNAs from many sources, and the degradation of potentially harmful short interspersed element and viral RNAs. These findings have sparked a renewed interest in these enzymes, and their diverse functions in biology."

Several classes of small (20-30 nucleotides) and long (>200 nucleotides) non-coding RNAs have been firmly established as key regulators of gene expression in myriad processes ranging from embryonic development to innate immunity. In this review, we focus on our current understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the biogenesis and function of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs) and Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs).

Non-coding ribonucleic acid (ncRNA) molecules regulate transcript and protein abundance above the level of transcription, and appear to play substantial roles in regulation of reproductive tissues. Three primary classes of small ncRNA are microRNA (miRNA), endogenous small interfering RNA (endo-siRNA), and PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA). These RNA classes have similarities and clear distinctions between their biogenesis and in the interacting protein machinery that facilitate their effects on cellular phenotype. Characterization of the expression and importance of the critical components for the biogenesis of each class in different tissues is continuously contributing a better understanding of each of these RNA classes in different reproductive cell types. Here, we discuss the expression and potential roles of miRNA, endo-siRNA, and piRNA in reproduction from germ-cell development to pregnancy establishment and placental function. Additionally, the potential contribution of RNA binding proteins, long ncRNAs, and the more recently discovered circular RNAs (circRNAs) in relation to small RNA function is discussed."

        "abstract": "Plant viruses encode RNA silencing suppressors (VSRs) to counteract the antiviral RNA silencing response. Based on in-vitro studies, several VSRs were proposed to suppress silencing through direct binding of short-interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Because their expression also frequently hinders endogenous miRNA-mediated regulation and stabilizes labile miRNA* strands, VSRs have been assumed to prevent both siRNA and miRNA loading into their common effector protein, AGO1, through sequestration of small RNA (sRNA) duplexes in vivo. These assumptions, however, have not been formally tested experimentally. Here, we present a systematic in planta analysis comparing the effects of four distinct VSRs in Arabidopsis. While all of the VSRs tested compromised loading of siRNAs into AGO1, only P19 was found to concurrently prevent miRNA loading, consistent with a VSR strategy primarily based on sRNA sequestration. By contrast, we provide multiple lines of evidence that the action of the other VSRs tested is unlikely to entail siRNA sequestration, indicating that in-vitro binding assays and in-vivo miRNA* stabilization are not reliable indicator of VSR action. The contrasted effects of VSRs on siRNA versus miRNA loading into AGO1 also imply the existence of two distinct pools of cellular AGO1 that are specifically loaded by each class of sRNAs. These findings have important implications for our current understanding of RNA silencing and of its suppression in plants."

The 2.3 angstrom resolution crystal structure of human Argonaute2 (Ago2) reveals a bilobed molecule with a central cleft for binding guide and target RNAs. Nucleotides 2 to 6 of a heterogeneous mixture of guide RNAs are positioned in an A-form conformation for base pairing with target messenger RNAs. Between nucleotides 6 and 7, there is a kink that may function in microRNA target recognition or release of sliced RNA products. Tandem tryptophan-binding pockets in the PIWI domain define a likely interaction surface for recruitment of glycine-tryptophan-182 (GW182) or other tryptophan-rich cofactors. These results will enable structure-based approaches for harnessing the untapped therapeutic potential of RNA silencing in humans."

        "abstract": "Biological systems use a variety of mechanisms to maintain their functions in the face of environmental and genetic perturbations. Increasing evidence suggests that, among their roles as posttranscriptional repressors of gene expression, microRNAs (miRNAs) help to confer robustness to biological processes by reinforcing transcriptional programs and attenuating aberrant transcripts, and they may in some network contexts help suppress random fluctuations in transcript copy number. These activities have important consequences for normal development and physiology, disease, and evolution. Here, we will discuss examples and principles of miRNAs that contribute to robustness in animal systems."

        "title": "Biochemical dissection of RNA silencing in plants.",
        "abstract": "Although RNA silencing was first discovered in plants, thus far it has been studied biochemically only in animals, where it is known as RNA interference (RNAi). In animals, two components of the RNAi pathway have been identified: Dicer, a multidomain RNase III that converts long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) into small interfering RNA (siRNA) and the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), as siRNA-containing protein-RNA complex that targets complementary mRNA for destruction. We have developed methods for the biochemical dissection of plant RNA silencing. In this chapter, we describe in detail how to use wheat germ extract to study two distinct Dicer-like activities, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), and endogenous microRNA-programmed RISC activities. These comprehensive protocols should prove useful in the further dissection of the plant RNA silencing pathway, as well as for the validation of the predicted targets of endogenous plant microRNAs."

        "title": "Human embryonic stem cells express a unique set of microRNAs.",
        "abstract": "Human embryonic stem (hES) cells are pluripotent cell lines established from the explanted inner cell mass of human blastocysts. Despite their importance for human embryology and regenerative medicine, studies on hES cells, unlike those on mouse ES (mES) cells, have been hampered by difficulties in culture and by scant knowledge concerning the regulatory mechanism. Recent evidence from plants and animals indicates small RNAs of approximately 22 nucleotides (nt), collectively named microRNAs, play important roles in developmental regulation. Here we describe 36 miRNAs (from 32 stem-loops) identified by cDNA cloning in hES cells. Importantly, most of the newly cloned miRNAs are specifically expressed in hES cells and downregulated during development into embryoid bodies (EBs), while miRNAs previously reported from other human cell types are poorly expressed in hES cells. We further show that some of the ES-specific miRNA genes are highly related to each other, organized as clusters, and transcribed as polycistronic primary transcripts. These miRNA gene families have murine homologues that have similar genomic organizations and expression patterns, suggesting that they may operate key regulatory networks conserved in mammalian pluripotent stem cells. The newly identified hES-specific miRNAs may also serve as molecular markers for the early embryonic stage and for undifferentiated hES cells."

        "abstract": "Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) directs gene-specific, post-transcriptional silencing in many organisms, including vertebrates, and has provided a new tool for studying gene function. The biochemical mechanisms underlying this dsRNA interference (RNAi) are unknown. Here we report the development of a cell-free system from syncytial blastoderm Drosophila embryos that recapitulates many of the features of RNAi. The interference observed in this reaction is sequence specific, is promoted by dsRNA but not single-stranded RNA, functions by specific mRNA degradation, and requires a minimum length of dsRNA. Furthermore, preincubation of dsRNA potentiates its activity. These results demonstrate that RNAi can be mediated by sequence-specific processes in soluble reactions."

        "abstract": "The heterochronic gene lin-28 of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans controls the relative timing of diverse developmental events during the animal's larval stages. lin-28 is stage-specifically regulated by two genetic circuits: negatively by the 22-nt RNA lin-4 and positively by the heterochronic gene lin-14. Here, we show that lin-28 is repressed during normal development by a mechanism that acts on its mRNA after translation initiation. We provide evidence that lin-14 inhibits a negative regulation that is independent of the lin-4 RNA and involves the gene daf-12, which encodes a nuclear hormone receptor. The lin-4-independent repression does not affect the initiation of translation on the lin-28 mRNA, and like the lin-4-mediated repression, acts through the gene's 3'-untranslated region. In addition, we find that lin-4 is not sufficient to cause repression of lin-28 if the lin-4-independent circuit is inhibited. Therefore, the lin-4-independent circuit likely contributes substantially to the down-regulation of lin-28 that occurs during normal development. The role of lin-4 may be to initiate or potentiate the lin-4-independent circuit. We speculate that a parallel lin-4-independent regulatory mechanism regulates the expression of lin-14."

        "title": "Short defective interfering RNAs of tombusviruses are not targeted but trigger post-transcriptional gene silencing against their helper virus.",
        "abstract": "Post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) is a sequence-specific degradation mechanism that operates in almost all eukaryotic cells. In plants, double-stranded RNA triggers PTGS, generating 21- to 25-nucleotide guide RNAs responsible for specific degradation of cognate mRNA. The double stranded RNA intermediates of replicating plant viruses often induce PTGS, leading to symptom attenuation. Here we demonstrate the role of PTGS in defective interfering (DI) RNA-mediated symptom attenuation in plants infected with Cymbidium ringspot tombusvirus (CymRSV). Analysis of 21- to 25-nucleotide RNAs in Nicotiana benthamiana infected with CymRSV indicated that PTGS was not spread homogeneously along the viral genome. The 21- to 25-nucleotide RNAs derived mainly from plus-stranded RNA and likely arose from local basepaired structures. In contrast to helper viral RNA, short DI RNAs were not accessible to helper virus-induced RNA degradation guided by the 21- to 25-nucleotide RNAs. Our results suggest a model in which PTGS plays an important role in the selective accumulation and symptom attenuation mediated by DI RNAs. Because PTGS operates in a wide variety of different organisms, this model is applicable to DI RNA generation and accumulation in both plant and animal cells."

Recent advances indicate that the small RNAs termed microRNAs play important roles in cell proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation. Moreover, the microRNA mechanism is an efficient means to regulate production of a diverse range of proteins. As new microRNAs and their mRNA targets rapidly emerge, it is becoming apparent that RNA-based regulation of mRNAs may rival ubiquitination as a mechanism to control protein levels."

We developed comparative genomic approaches to systematically identify both miRNAs and their targets that are conserved in Arabidopsis thaliana and rice (Oryza sativa). Twenty-three miRNA candidates, representing seven newly identified gene families, were experimentally validated in Arabidopsis, bringing the total number of reported miRNA genes to 92, representing 22 families. Nineteen newly identified target candidates were confirmed by detecting mRNA fragments diagnostic of miRNA-directed cleavage in plants. Overall, plant miRNAs have a strong propensity to target genes controlling development, particularly those of transcription factors and F-box proteins. However, plant miRNAs have conserved regulatory functions extending beyond development, in that they also target superoxide dismutases, laccases, and ATP sulfurylases. The expression of miR395, the sulfurylase-targeting miRNA, increases upon sulfate starvation, showing that miRNAs can be induced by environmental stress."

Here we describe that in a human neuronal cell line, the miRNP proteins eIF2C2 (a member of the Argonaute family of proteins), Gemin3, and Gemin4 along with miRNAs cosediment with polyribosomes. Furthermore, we describe a physical association between a let-7b (miRNA)-containing miRNP and its putative human mRNA target in polyribosome-containing fractions. These findings suggest that miRNP proteins may play important roles in target mRNA recognition and translational repression."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are 21-24 nucleotides long molecules processed from imperfect double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs). They regulate gene expression by targeting complementary mRNA for cleavage or interfering with their translation. In Arabidopsis, point mutations in or short truncations of the nuclear DICER-LIKE1 (DCL1) or HEN1 protein reduce miRNA accumulation and increase uncleaved target mRNAs accumulation, resulting in developmental abnormalities. Here, we show that miRNA accumulation also depends on the activity of HYL1, a nuclear dsRNA binding protein. hyl1 mutants exhibit developmental defects overlapping with that of dcl1 and hen1 mutants, suggesting that DCL1, HEN1, and HYL1 act together in the nucleus. We validate additional target mRNAs and show that reduced miRNA accumulation in hyl1 correlates with an increased accumulation of uncleaved target mRNAs, including meristem- and auxin-related genes, providing clues for the developmental abnormalities of hyl1 and for the previous identification of hyl1 as a mutant with altered responses to phytohormones. Lastly, we show that posttranscriptional transgene silencing occurs in hyl1, suggesting that HYL1 has specialized function in the plant miRNA pathway, whereas the HYL1-related RDE-4 and R2D2 proteins associate with DICER in the cytoplasm and act in the RNAi pathway in C. elegans and Drosophila, respectively."

        "title": "Human microRNA genes are frequently located at fragile sites and genomic regions involved in cancers.",
        "abstract": "A large number of tiny noncoding RNAs have been cloned and named microRNAs (miRs). Recently, we have reported that miR-15a and miR-16a, located at 13q14, are frequently deleted and/or down-regulated in patients with B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, a disorder characterized by increased survival. To further investigate the possible involvement of miRs in human cancers on a genome-wide basis, we have mapped 186 miRs and compared their location to the location of previous reported nonrandom genetic alterations. Here, we show that miR genes are frequently located at fragile sites, as well as in minimal regions of loss of heterozygosity, minimal regions of amplification (minimal amplicons), or common breakpoint regions. Overall, 98 of 186 (52.5%) of miR genes are in cancer-associated genomic regions or in fragile sites. Moreover, by Northern blotting, we have shown that several miRs located in deleted regions have low levels of expression in cancer samples. These data provide a catalog of miR genes that may have roles in cancer and argue that the full complement of miRs in a genome may be extensively involved in cancers."

        "title": "Molecular mechanism of RNA silencing suppression mediated by p19 protein of tombusviruses.",
        "abstract": "RNA silencing is an evolutionarily conserved surveillance system that occurs in a broad range of eukaryotic organisms. In plants, RNA silencing acts as an antiviral system; thus, successful virus infection requires suppression of gene silencing. A number of viral suppressors have been identified so far; however, the molecular bases of silencing suppression are still poorly understood. Here we show that p19 of Cymbidium ringspot virus (CymRSV) inhibits RNA silencing via its small RNA-binding activity in vivo. Small RNAs bound by p19 in planta are bona fide double-stranded siRNAs and they are silencing competent in the in vitro RNA-silencing system. p19 also suppresses RNA silencing in the heterologous Drosophila in vitro system by preventing siRNA incorporation into RISC. During CymRSV infection, p19 markedly diminishes the amount of free siRNA in cells by forming p19-siRNA complexes, thus making siRNAs inaccessible for effector complexes of RNA-silencing machinery. Furthermore, the obtained results also suggest that the p19-mediated sequestration of siRNAs in virus-infected cells blocks the spread of the mobile, systemic signal of RNA silencing."

        "abstract": "Although microRNAs (miRNAs) are key regulators of gene expression in normal human physiology and disease, transcriptional regulation of miRNAs is poorly understood, because most miRNA promoters have not yet been characterized. We identified the proximal promoters of 175 human miRNAs by combining nucleosome mapping with chromatin signatures for promoters. We observe that one-third of intronic miRNAs have transcription initiation regions independent from their host promoters and present a list of RNA polymerase II- and III-occupied miRNAs. Nucleosome mapping and linker sequence analyses in miRNA promoters permitted accurate prediction of transcription factors regulating miRNA expression, thus identifying nine miRNAs regulated by the MITF transcription factor/oncoprotein in melanoma cells. Furthermore, DNA sequences encoding mature miRNAs were found to be preferentially occupied by positioned-nucleosomes, and the 3' end sites of known genes exhibited nucleosome depletion. The high-throughput identification of miRNA promoter and enhancer regulatory elements sheds light on evolution of miRNA transcription and permits rapid identification of transcriptional networks of miRNAs."

        "title": "The evolution of RNAi as a defence against viruses and transposable elements.",
        "abstract": "RNA interference (RNAi) is an important defence against viruses and transposable elements (TEs). RNAi not only protects against viruses by degrading viral RNA, but hosts and viruses can also use RNAi to manipulate each other's gene expression, and hosts can encode microRNAs that target viral sequences. In response, viruses have evolved a myriad of adaptations to suppress and evade RNAi. RNAi can also protect cells against TEs, both by degrading TE transcripts and by preventing TE expression through heterochromatin formation. The aim of our review is to summarize and evaluate the current data on the evolution of these RNAi defence mechanisms. To this end, we also extend a previous analysis of the evolution of genes of the RNAi pathways. Strikingly, we find that antiviral RNAi genes, anti-TE RNAi genes and viral suppressors of RNAi all evolve rapidly, suggestive of an evolutionary arms race between hosts and parasites. Over longer time scales, key RNAi genes are repeatedly duplicated or lost across the metazoan phylogeny, with important implications for RNAi as an immune defence."

        "abstract": "Transgene-induced post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) results from specific degradation of RNAs that are homologous with the transgene transcribed sequence. This phenomenon, also known as cosuppression in plants and quelling in fungi, resembles RNA interference (RNAi) in animals. Indeed, cosuppression/quelling/RNAi require related PAZ/PIWI proteins (AGO1/QDE-2/RDE-1), indicating that these mechanisms are related. Unlike Neurospora crassa qde-2 and Caenorhabditis elegans rde-1 mutants, which are morphologically normal, the 24 known Arabidopsis ago1 mutants display severe developmental abnormalities and are sterile. Here, we report the isolation of hypomorphic ago1 mutants, including fertile ones. We show that these hypomorphic ago1 mutants are defective for PTGS, like null sgs2, sgs3, and ago1 mutants, suggesting that PTGS is more sensitive than development to perturbations in AGO1. Conversely, a mutation in ZWILLE/PINHEAD, another member of the Arabidopsis AGO1 gene family, affects development but not PTGS. Similarly, mutations in ALG-1 and ALG-2, two members of the C. elegans RDE-1 gene family, affect development but not RNAi, indicating that the control of PTGS/RNAi and development by PAZ/PIWI proteins can be uncoupled. Finally, we show that hypomorphic ago1 mutants are hypersensitive to virus infection, confirming the hypothesis that in plants PTGS is a mechanism of defense against viruses."

We report here a new vector system, named pSUPER, which directs the synthesis of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in mammalian cells. We show that siRNA expression mediated by this vector causes efficient and specific down-regulation of gene expression, resulting in functional inactivation of the targeted genes. Stable expression of siRNAs using this vector mediates persistent suppression of gene expression, allowing the analysis of loss-of-function phenotypes that develop over longer periods of time. Therefore, the pSUPER vector constitutes a new and powerful system to analyze gene function in a variety of mammalian cell types."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are noncoding small RNAs that repress protein translation by targeting specific messenger RNAs. miR-15a and miR-16-1 act as putative tumor suppressors by targeting the oncogene BCL2. These miRNAs form a cluster at the chromosomal region 13q14, which is frequently deleted in cancer. Here, we report that the miR-15a and miR-16-1 cluster targets CCND1 (encoding cyclin D1) and WNT3A, which promotes several tumorigenic features such as survival, proliferation and invasion. In cancer cells of advanced prostate tumors, the miR-15a and miR-16 level is significantly decreased, whereas the expression of BCL2, CCND1 and WNT3A is inversely upregulated. Delivery of antagomirs specific for miR-15a and miR-16 to normal mouse prostate results in marked hyperplasia, and knockdown of miR-15a and miR-16 promotes survival, proliferation and invasiveness of untransformed prostate cells, which become tumorigenic in immunodeficient NOD-SCID mice. Conversely, reconstitution of miR-15a and miR-16-1 expression results in growth arrest, apoptosis and marked regression of prostate tumor xenografts. Altogether, we propose that miR-15a and miR-16 act as tumor suppressor genes in prostate cancer through the control of cell survival, proliferation and invasion. These findings have therapeutic implications and may be exploited for future treatment of prostate cancer."

Reduction in SMN protein results in Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a common neurodegenerative disease. The SMN complex has critical functions in the assembly/restructuring of diverse ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes. Here we report that Gemin3 and Gemin4 are also in a separate complex that contains eIF2C2, a member of the Argonaute protein family. This novel complex is a large approximately 15S RNP that contains numerous microRNAs (miRNAs). We describe 40 miRNAs, a few of which are identical to recently described human miRNAs, a class of small endogenous RNAs. The genomic sequences predict that miRNAs are likely to be derived from larger precursors that have the capacity to form stem-loop structures."

Arabidopsis thaliana TAS1 and TAS2 families yield tasiRNA that form through miR173-guided initiation-cleavage of primary transcripts and target several transcripts encoding pentatricopeptide repeat proteins and proteins of unknown function. Here, the TAS1c locus was modified to produce synthetic (syn) tasiRNA to target an endogenous transcript encoding PHYTOENE DESATURASE and used to analyze the role of miR173 in routing of transcripts through the tasiRNA pathway. miR173 was unique from other miRNAs in its ability to initiate TAS1c-based syn-tasiRNA formation. A single miR173 target site was sufficient to route non-TAS transcripts into the pathway to yield phased siRNA. We also show that miR173 functions in association with ARGONAUTE 1 (AGO1) during TAS1 and TAS2 tasiRNA formation, and we provide data indicating that the miR173-AGO1 complex possesses unique functionality that many other miRNA-AGO1 complexes lack."

Recent evidence indicates that miRNA-mediated gene regulation is critical for normal cellular functions, and as much as one-third of human mRNAs may be miRNA targets. Emerging evidence suggests that miRNAs play a key role in the regulation of immunological functions including innate and adaptive immune responses, development and differentiation of immune cells, and the prevention of autoimmunity. Here, we review the mechanisms of miRNA maturation and function, the roles of several miRNAs in immunological functions, and the involvement of miRNAs in disease pathogenesis."

Identification of bona fide miRNA target sites in animals is challenging because of uncertainties regarding the base-pairing requirements between miRNA and target as well as the location of functional binding sites within mRNAs. Here we present the results of a comprehensive strategy aimed at isolating endogenous mRNA target sequences bound by the Argonaute protein ALG-1 in C. elegans. Using cross-linking and ALG-1 immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing (CLIP-seq), we identified extensive ALG-1 interactions with specific 3' untranslated region (UTR) and coding exon sequences and discovered features that distinguish miRNA complex binding sites in 3' UTRs from those in other genic regions. Furthermore, our analyses revealed a striking enrichment of Argonaute binding sites in genes important for miRNA function, suggesting an autoregulatory role that may confer robustness to the miRNA pathway."

        "abstract": "The precise control of microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis is critical for embryonic development and normal cellular functions, and its dysregulation is often associated with human diseases. Though the birth and maturation pathway of miRNA has been established, the regulation and death pathway remains largely unknown. Here, we report the RNA-binding proteins, Lin28a and Lin28b, as posttranscriptional repressors of let-7 miRNA biogenesis. We observe that the Lin28 proteins act mainly in the cytoplasm by inducing uridylation of precursor let-7 (pre-let-7) at its 3' end. The uridylated pre-let-7 (up-let-7) fails Dicer processing and undergoes degradation. We provide a mechanism for the posttranscriptional regulation of miRNA biogenesis by Lin28 which is highly expressed in undifferentiated cells and certain cancer cells. The Lin28-mediated downregulation of let-7 may play a key role in development, stem cell programming, and tumorigenesis."

        "abstract": "During the menstrual cycle, human endometrium undergoes extensive cyclic morphologic and biochemical modifications in preparation for embryo implantation. These processes are highly regulated by ovarian steroids and various locally expressed gene products and involve inflammatory reaction, apoptosis, cell proliferation, angiogenesis, differentiation (tissue formation), and tissue remodeling. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as key regulators of gene expression, and their altered and/or aberrant expression has been associated with establishment and progression of various disorders, including tumorigenesis. This review highlights the endometrial expression of miRNAs and their potential regulatory functions under normal and pathologic conditions such as endometriosis, dysfunctional uterine bleeding, and endometrial cancer. Given the key regulatory function of miRNAs on gene expression stability, understanding the underlying mechanisms of how endometrial miRNAs are regulated and identifying their specific target genes and their functions might lead to the development of preventive and therapeutic strategies by regulating specific target genes associated with such reproductive disorders."

        "title": "Most mammalian mRNAs are conserved targets of microRNAs.",
        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small endogenous RNAs that pair to sites in mRNAs to direct post-transcriptional repression. Many sites that match the miRNA seed (nucleotides 2-7), particularly those in 3' untranslated regions (3'UTRs), are preferentially conserved. Here, we overhauled our tool for finding preferential conservation of sequence motifs and applied it to the analysis of human 3'UTRs, increasing by nearly threefold the detected number of preferentially conserved miRNA target sites. The new tool more efficiently incorporates new genomes and more completely controls for background conservation by accounting for mutational biases, dinucleotide conservation rates, and the conservation rates of individual UTRs. The improved background model enabled preferential conservation of a new site type, the \"offset 6mer,\" to be detected. In total, >45,000 miRNA target sites within human 3'UTRs are conserved above background levels, and >60% of human protein-coding genes have been under selective pressure to maintain pairing to miRNAs. Mammalian-specific miRNAs have far fewer conserved targets than do the more broadly conserved miRNAs, even when considering only more recently emerged targets. Although pairing to the 3' end of miRNAs can compensate for seed mismatches, this class of sites constitutes less than 2% of all preferentially conserved sites detected. The new tool enables statistically powerful analysis of individual miRNA target sites, with the probability of preferentially conserved targeting (P(CT)) correlating with experimental measurements of repression. Our expanded set of target predictions (including conserved 3'-compensatory sites), are available at the TargetScan website, which displays the P(CT) for each site and each predicted target."

While siRNAs in addition act in transcriptional gene silencing, a role of miRNAs in transcriptional regulation has been less clear. We show here that in moss Physcomitrella patens mutants without a DICER-LIKE1b gene, maturation of miRNAs is normal but cleavage of target RNAs is abolished and levels of these transcripts are drastically reduced. These mutants accumulate miRNA:target-RNA duplexes and show hypermethylation of the genes encoding target RNAs, leading to gene silencing. This pathway occurs also in the wild-type upon hormone treatment. We propose that initiation of epigenetic silencing by DNA methylation depends on the ratio of the miRNA and its target RNA."

        "title": "MicroRNAs: new regulators of immune cell development and function.",
        "abstract": "Decades of research went into understanding immune cell development and function without awareness that consideration of a key element, microRNA (miRNA), was lacking. The discovery of miRNAs as regulators of developmental events in model organisms suggested to many investigators that miRNA might be involved in the immune system. In the past few years, widespread examination of this possibility has produced notable results. Results have shown that miRNAs affect mammalian immune cell differentiation, the outcome of immune responses to infection and the development of diseases of immunological origin. Some miRNAs repress expression of target proteins with well established functions in hematopoiesis. Here we bring together much of this work, which has so far only scratched the surface of this very fertile field of investigation, and show how the results illuminate many historic questions about hematopoiesis and immune function."

        "title": "Enjoy the Silence: The Story of let-7 MicroRNA and Cancer.",
        "abstract": "Cancer is a multi-step disease involving dynamic changes in the genome. However, studies on cancer genome so far have focused most heavily on protein-coding genes, and our knowledge on alterations of the functional noncoding sequences in cancer is largely absent. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small noncoding RNAs weighing 20 to 23 nucleotides that negatively regulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level by base pairing to the 3' untranslated region of target messenger RNAs. Hundreds of miRNAs have been identified in humans and are evolutionarily conserved from plants to animals. These tiny but potent molecules regulate various physiological and pathological pathways such as cell differentiation and cell proliferation. Recently, miRNA alterations have been linked to the initiation and the progression of human cancer. As a consequence, MiRNA-expression profiling of human tumors has identified signatures associated with diagnosis, staging, progression, prognosis and response to treatment. In addition, profiling has been exploited to identify miRNA genes that might represent downstream targets of activated oncogenic pathways, or that target proteincoding genes involved in cancer. Of importance, pioneering studies described let-7 miRNA as a negative regulator of the oncogenic family of Ras guanosine triphosphatases in both Caenorhabditis elegans and human tumor cell lines. Later, let-7 expression deregulation was reported in several cancers, suggesting that let-7 may act as a tumor suppressor. This review will discuss the late insights in let-7 function, the elationship between let-7 and tumorigenesis, and the potential for modulating let-7 expression for the treatment of cancer."

        "title": "Circulating microRNAs as stable blood-based markers for cancer detection.",
        "abstract": "Improved approaches for the detection of common epithelial malignancies are urgently needed to reduce the worldwide morbidity and mortality caused by cancer. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small ( approximately 22 nt) regulatory RNAs that are frequently dysregulated in cancer and have shown promise as tissue-based markers for cancer classification and prognostication. We show here that miRNAs are present in human plasma in a remarkably stable form that is protected from endogenous RNase activity. miRNAs originating from human prostate cancer xenografts enter the circulation, are readily measured in plasma, and can robustly distinguish xenografted mice from controls. This concept extends to cancer in humans, where serum levels of miR-141 (a miRNA expressed in prostate cancer) can distinguish patients with prostate cancer from healthy controls. Our results establish the measurement of tumor-derived miRNAs in serum or plasma as an important approach for the blood-based detection of human cancer."

        "abstract": "microRNAs act in a prevalent and conserved post-transcriptional gene regulatory mechanism that impacts development, homeostasis and disease, yet biological functions for the vast majority of miRNAs remain unknown. Given the power of invertebrate genetics to promote rapid evaluation of miRNA function, recently expanded miRNA identifications (miRBase 10.1), and the importance of assessing potential functional redundancies within and between species, we evaluated miRNA sequence relationships by 5' end match and overall homology criteria to compile a snapshot overview of miRNA families within the C. elegans and D. melanogaster genomes that includes their identified human counterparts. This compilation expands literature documentation of both the number of families and the number of family members, within and between nematode and fly models, and highlights sequences conserved between species pairs or among nematodes, flies and humans. Themes that emerge include the substantial potential for functional redundancy of miRNA sequences within species (84/139 C. elegans miRNAs and 70/152 D. melanogaster miRNAs share significant homology with other miRNAs encoded by their respective genomes), and the striking extent to which miRNAs are conserved across species--over half (73/139) C. elegans miRNAs share sequence homology with miRNAs encoded also in both fly and human genomes. This summary analysis of mature miRNA sequence relationships provides a quickly accessible resource that should facilitate functional and evolutionary analyses of miRNAs and miRNA families."

        "title": "The impact of microRNAs on protein output.",
        "abstract": "MicroRNAs are endogenous approximately 23-nucleotide RNAs that can pair to sites in the messenger RNAs of protein-coding genes to downregulate the expression from these messages. MicroRNAs are known to influence the evolution and stability of many mRNAs, but their global impact on protein output had not been examined. Here we use quantitative mass spectrometry to measure the response of thousands of proteins after introducing microRNAs into cultured cells and after deleting mir-223 in mouse neutrophils. The identities of the responsive proteins indicate that targeting is primarily through seed-matched sites located within favourable predicted contexts in 3' untranslated regions. Hundreds of genes were directly repressed, albeit each to a modest degree, by individual microRNAs. Although some targets were repressed without detectable changes in mRNA levels, those translationally repressed by more than a third also displayed detectable mRNA destabilization, and, for the more highly repressed targets, mRNA destabilization usually comprised the major component of repression. The impact of microRNAs on the proteome indicated that for most interactions microRNAs act as rheostats to make fine-scale adjustments to protein output."

        "abstract": "Animal microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression by inhibiting translation and/or by inducing degradation of target messenger RNAs. It is unknown how much translational control is exerted by miRNAs on a genome-wide scale. We used a new proteomic approach to measure changes in synthesis of several thousand proteins in response to miRNA transfection or endogenous miRNA knockdown. In parallel, we quantified mRNA levels using microarrays. Here we show that a single miRNA can repress the production of hundreds of proteins, but that this repression is typically relatively mild. A number of known features of the miRNA-binding site such as the seed sequence also govern repression of human protein synthesis, and we report additional target sequence characteristics. We demonstrate that, in addition to downregulating mRNA levels, miRNAs also directly repress translation of hundreds of genes. Finally, our data suggest that a miRNA can, by direct or indirect effects, tune protein synthesis from thousands of genes."

        "title": "Evidence for antisense transcription associated with microRNA target mRNAs in Arabidopsis.",
        "abstract": "Antisense transcription is a pervasive phenomenon, but its source and functional significance is largely unknown. We took an expression-based approach to explore microRNA (miRNA)-related antisense transcription by computational analyses of published whole-genome tiling microarray transcriptome and deep sequencing small RNA (smRNA) data. Statistical support for greater abundance of antisense transcription signatures and smRNAs was observed for miRNA targets than for paralogous genes with no miRNA cleavage site. Antisense smRNAs were also found associated with MIRNA genes. This suggests that miRNA-associated \"transitivity\" (production of small interfering RNAs through antisense transcription) is more common than previously reported. High-resolution (3 nt) custom tiling microarray transcriptome analysis was performed with probes 400 bp 5' upstream and 3' downstream of the miRNA cleavage sites (direction relative to the mRNA) for 22 select miRNA target genes. We hybridized RNAs labeled from the smRNA pathway mutants, including hen1-1, dcl1-7, hyl1-2, rdr6-15, and sgs3-14. Results showed that antisense transcripts associated with miRNA targets were mainly elevated in hen1-1 and sgs3-14 to a lesser extent, and somewhat reduced in dcl11-7, hyl11-2, or rdr6-15 mutants. This was corroborated by semi-quantitative reverse transcription PCR; however, a direct correlation of antisense transcript abundance in MIR164 gene knockouts was not observed. Our overall analysis reveals a more widespread role for miRNA-associated transitivity with implications for functions of antisense transcription in gene regulation. HEN1 and SGS3 may be links for miRNA target entry into different RNA processing pathways."

Using available technology and bioinformatics investigators will soon be able to identify relevant bio molecular tumor network hubs as potential key targets for knockdown approaches. Methods of mediating the RNAi effect involve small interfering RNA (siRNA), short hairpin RNA (shRNA) and bi-functional shRNA. The simplicity of siRNA manufacturing and transient nature of the effect per dose are optimally suited for certain medical disorders (i.e. viral injections). However, using the endogenous processing machinery, optimized shRNA constructs allow for high potency and sustainable effects using low copy numbers resulting in less off-target effects, particularly if embedded in a miRNA scaffold. Bi-functional design may further enhance potency and safety of RNAi-based therapeutics. Remaining challenges include tumor selective delivery vehicles and more complete evaluation of the scope and scale of off-target effects. This review will compare siRNA, shRNA and bi-functional shRNA."

As miRNAs and their regulatory functions are further revealed, the more the importance of miRNA-directed gene regulation is emphasised. In the human genome, 695 mature miRNAs have been identified, although computational calculation predicts that this may increase to >1000. Deregulation of miRNA expression profiles is thought to be implicated in the pathogenesis of many human cancers including breast tumours. Breast cancer subtypes are observed to have deranged miRNA expression signatures, which makes miRNAs important targets for developing a novel molecular classification of breast cancer and opening avenues for more individualised treatment strategies for patients with breast cancer."

        "abstract": "The ARGONAUTE gene family is involved in the regulation of gene expression via the RNAi Silencing Complex (RISC). microRNA (miRNA) are 20-22bp RNAs that direct RISC to target genes. Several miRNA have been characterized in plants. Their roles include control of flowering time, floral organ identity, cell division patterns, and leaf polarity. ARGONAUTE1 (AGO1) is required for stem cell function and organ polarity, as is the closely related protein PINHEAD/ZWILLE (PNH/ZLL). Through phenotypic and double mutant analysis, we show that AGO1 regulates stem cell function via SHOOT MERISTEMLESS (STM). CUPSHAPED COTYLEDONS1 and 2 (CUC1 and CUC2) positively regulate STM and are targets of miRNA. The effect of AGO1 on leaf polarity is dependent, in part, on its role in meristem function revealed by interactions with ASYMMETRIC LEAVES1(AS1). AGO1 is required for full expression of LEAFY (LFY), APETALA1 (AP1) and AGAMOUS (AG). Flowering time is unaffected but floral meristem identity is partially restored in a curlyleaf (clf) background and this is not due to clf's affects on AG expression. CLF is over expressed in ago1, showing that the RNAi pathway regulates polycomb-type epigenetic modifiers."

A total of 37% of the known human miRNA genes analyzed in this study appear in clusters of two or more with pairwise chromosomal distances of at most 3000 nt. Comparison of the miRNA sequences with their homologs in four other organisms reveals a typical conservation pattern, persistent throughout the clusters. Furthermore, we show enrichment in the typical conservation patterns and other miRNA-like properties in the vicinity of known miRNA genes, compared with random genomic regions. This may imply that additional, yet unknown, miRNAs reside in these regions, consistent with the current recognition that there are overlooked miRNAs. Indeed, by comparing our predictions with cloning results and with identified miRNA genes in other mammals, we corroborate the predictions of 18 additional human miRNA genes in the vicinity of the previously known ones. Our study raises the proportion of clustered human miRNAs that are <3000 nt apart to 42%. This suggests that the clustering of miRNA genes is higher than currently acknowledged, alluding to its evolutionary and functional implications."

        "abstract": "Since the first description of RNA interference (RNAi) in animals less than a decade ago, there has been rapid progress towards its use as a therapeutic modality against human diseases. Advances in our understanding of the mechanisms of RNAi and studies of RNAi in vivo indicate that RNAi-based therapies might soon provide a powerful new arsenal against pathogens and diseases for which treatment options are currently limited. Recent findings have highlighted both promise and challenges in using RNAi for therapeutic applications. Design and delivery strategies for RNAi effector molecules must be carefully considered to address safety concerns and to ensure effective, successful treatment of human diseases."

        "abstract": "In less than 10 years since its inception, RNA interference (RNAi) has had extraordinary impact on biomedical science. RNAi has been demonstrated to influence numerous biological and disease pathways. Development and adoption of RNAi technologies have been prolific ranging from basic loss-of-function tools, genome-wide screening libraries to pharmaceutical target validation and therapeutic development. However, understanding of the molecular mechanisms of RNAi is far from complete. The purpose of this brief review is to highlight key achievements in elucidating the biochemical mechanisms of the RNA-induced silencing complex and to outline major challenges for the field."

        "title": "The micro-ribonucleic acid (miRNA) miR-206 targets the human estrogen receptor-alpha (ERalpha) and represses ERalpha messenger RNA and protein expression in breast cancer cell lines.",
        "abstract": "Micro-RNAs are small noncoding RNAs, which diminish the stability and/or translation of mRNAs. This study examined whether miR-206, previously shown to be elevated in estrogen receptor (ER)alpha-negative breast cancer, regulates the expression of ERalpha. Two putative miR-206 sites, (hERalpha1 and hERalpha2), were found in silico within the 3'-untranslated region of human ERalpha mRNA. Transfection of MCF-7 cells with pre-miR-206 or 2'-O-methyl antagomiR-206 specifically decreased or increased, respectively, ERalpha mRNA levels. Overexpression of pre-miR-206 reduced ERalpha and beta-actin protein levels, with no effect on ERbeta, E-cadherin, or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Reporter constructs containing the hERalpha1 or hERalpha2 binding sites inserted into the 3'-untranslated region of the luciferase mRNA conferred a 1.6- and 2.2-fold repression of luciferase activity, respectively, in HeLa cells. Both miR-206 sites responded accordingly to exogenous hsa-pre-miR-206 and 2'-O-methyl antagomiR-206, and both sites were rendered inactive by mutations that disrupted hybridization to the 5'-seed of miR-206. A C-->T single nucleotide polymorphism in the hERalpha1 site increased repression of luciferase activity to approximately 3.3-fold in HeLa cells. MiR-206 levels were higher in ERalpha-negative MB-MDA-231 cells than ERalpha-positive MCF-7 cells, but only the ERalpha1 site mediated significantly more repression in reporter constructs. MiR-206 expression was strongly inhibited by ERalpha agonists, but not by an ERbeta agonist or progesterone, indicating a mutually inhibitory feedback loop. These findings provide the first evidence for the posttranscriptional regulation of ERalpha by a micro-RNA in the context of breast cancer."

        "title": "Therapeutic RNA interference for neurodegenerative diseases: From promise to progress.",
        "abstract": "RNA interference (RNAi) has emerged as a powerful tool to manipulate gene expression in the laboratory. Due to its remarkable discriminating properties, individual genes, or even alleles can be targeted with exquisite specificity in cultured cells or living animals. Among its many potential biomedical applications, silencing of disease-linked genes stands out as a promising therapeutic strategy for many incurable disorders. Neurodegenerative diseases represent one of the more attractive targets for the development of therapeutic RNAi. In this group of diseases, the progressive loss of neurons leads to the gradual appearance of disabling neurological symptoms and premature death. Currently available therapies aim to improve the symptoms but not to halt the process of neurodegeneration. The increasing prevalence and economic burden of some of these diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) or Parkinson's disease (PD), has boosted the efforts invested in the development of interventions, such as RNAi, aimed at altering their natural course. This review will summarize where we stand in the therapeutic application of RNAi for neurodegenerative diseases. The basic principles of RNAi will be reviewed, focusing on features important for its therapeutic manipulation. Subsequently, a stepwise strategy for the development of therapeutic RNAi will be presented. Finally, the different preclinical trials of therapeutic RNAi completed in disease models will be summarized, stressing the experimental questions that need to be addressed before planning application in human disease."

Here, we review the role of noncoding RNA in heterochromatic silencing and in the silencing of transposable elements (TEs), unpaired DNA in meiosis, and developmentally excised DNA. The role of cotranscriptional processing by RNA interference and by other mechanisms is discussed, as well as parallels with RNA silencing in imprinting, paramutation, polycomb silencing, and X inactivation. Interactions with regulatory sequences may well occur, but at the RNA rather than at the DNA level."

        "abstract": "In Drosophila, repeat-associated small interfering RNAs (rasiRNAs) are produced in the germ line by a Dicer-independent pathway and function through the PIWI subfamily of Argonautes to ensure silencing of retrotransposons. We sequenced small RNAs associated with the PIWI subfamily member AGO3. Although other members of PIWI, Aubergine (Aub) and Piwi, associated with rasiRNAs derived mainly from the antisense strand of retrotransposons, AGO3-associated rasiRNAs arose mainly from the sense strand. Aub- and Piwi-associated rasiRNAs showed a strong preference for uracil at their 5' ends, and AGO3-associated rasiRNAs showed a strong preference for adenine at nucleotide 10. Comparisons between AGO3- and Aub-associated rasiRNAs revealed pairs of rasiRNAs showing complementarities in their first 10 nucleotides. Aub and AGO3 exhibited Slicer activity in vitro. These data support a model in which formation of a 5' terminus within rasiRNA precursors is guided by rasiRNAs originating from transcripts of the other strand in concert with the Slicer activity of PIWI."

Aberrant miRNA expression can contribute to tumorigenesis, but which of the many miRNA-target relationships are relevant to this process has been unclear. Here, we report that chromosomal translocations previously associated with human tumors disrupt repression of High Mobility Group A2 (Hmga2) by let-7 miRNA. This disrupted repression promotes anchorage-independent growth, a characteristic of oncogenic transformation. Thus, losing miRNA-directed repression of an oncogene provides a mechanism for tumorigenesis, and disrupting a single miRNA-target interaction can produce an observable phenotype in mammalian cells."

However, the importance of miRNA editing remains largely undetermined. Here we report that tissue-specific adenosine-to-inosine editing of miR-376 cluster transcripts leads to predominant expression of edited miR-376 isoform RNAs. One highly edited site is positioned in the middle of the 5'-proximal half \"seed\" region critical for the hybridization of miRNAs to targets. We provide evidence that the edited miR-376 RNA silences specifically a different set of genes. Repression of phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase 1, a target of the edited miR-376 RNA and an enzyme involved in the uric-acid synthesis pathway, contributes to tight and tissue-specific regulation of uric-acid levels, revealing a previously unknown role for RNA editing in miRNA-mediated gene silencing."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a novel class of small noncoding RNAs that modulate the expression of genes at the posttranscriptional level. These small molecules have been shown to be involved in cancer, apoptosis, and cell metabolism. In the present study we provide an informative profile of the expression of miRNAs in primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells using 2 independent and quantitative methods: miRNA cloning and quantitative real-time-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) of mature miRNAs. Both approaches show that miR-21 and miR-155 are dramatically overexpressed in patients with CLL, although the corresponding genomic loci are not amplified. miR-150 and miR-92 are also significantly deregulated in patients with CLL. In addition, we detected a marked miR-15a and miR-16 decrease in about 11% of cases. Finally, we identified a set of miRNAs whose expression correlates with biologic parameters of prognostic relevance, particularly with the mutational status of the IgV(H) genes. In summary, the results of this study offer for the first time a comprehensive and quantitative profile of miRNA expression in CLL and their healthy counterpart, suggesting that miRNAs could play a primary role in the disease itself."

Using this method we predict target sites for all known miRNAs in flies, worms, fish, and mammals. By comparing our predictions in fly with a reference set of experimentally tested miRNA-mRNA interactions we show that our general method performs at least as well as the most accurate methods available to date, including ones specifically tailored for target prediction in fly. An important novel feature of our model is that it explicitly infers the phylogenetic distribution of functional target sites, independently for each miRNA. This allows us to infer species-specific and clade-specific miRNA targeting. We also show that, in long human 3' UTRs, miRNA target sites occur preferentially near the start and near the end of the 3' UTR. To characterize miRNA function beyond the predicted lists of targets we further present a method to infer significant associations between the sets of targets predicted for individual miRNAs and specific biochemical pathways, in particular those of the KEGG pathway database. We show that this approach retrieves several known functional miRNA-mRNA associations, and predicts novel functions for known miRNAs in cell growth and in development."

Moreover, by combining our predictions with pathway analysis, we propose functions of specific miRNAs in nervous system development, inter-cellular communication and cell growth.

To date, cloning has identified over 200 miRNAs from diverse eukaryotic organisms. Despite their success, such biochemical approaches are skewed toward identifying abundant miRNAs, unlike genome-wide, sequence-based computational predictions. We developed informatic methods to predict miRNAs in the C. elegans genome using sequence conservation and structural similarity to known miRNAs and generated 214 candidates. We confirmed the expression of four new miRNAs by Northern blotting and used a more sensitive PCR approach to verify the expression of ten additional candidates. Based on hypotheses underlying our computational methods, we estimate that the C. elegans genome may encode between 140 and 300 miRNAs and potentially many more."

        "abstract": "Small RNAs, such as microRNAs and small interfering RNAs, act through Argonaute (Ago) proteins as a part of RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISCs). To make RISCs, Ago proteins bind and subsequently unwind small RNA duplexes, finally leaving one strand stably incorporated. Here we identified the N domain of human AGO2 as the initiator of duplex unwinding during RISC assembly. We discovered that a functional N domain is strictly required for small RNA duplex unwinding but not for precedent duplex loading or subsequent target cleavage. We postulate that RISC assembly is tripartite, comprising (i) RISC loading, whereby Ago undergoes conformational opening and loads a small RNA duplex, forming pre-RISC; (ii) wedging, whereby the end of the duplex is pried open through active wedging by the N domain, in preparation for unwinding; and (iii) unwinding, whereby the passenger strand is removed through slicer-dependent or slicer-independent unwinding, forming mature RISC."

This class of RNAs is thought to be functionally important because many individual miRNAs are evolutionally conserved across widely diverse phyla. Further, miRNAs are associated with diverse biological phenomena, such as cell growth, apoptosis, development, differentiation, cancer, and arthritis. MicroRNA research is one of a number of rapidly evolving fields of basic and biomedical science, with many new techniques being developed. However, miRNA experiments require modifications of preexisting molecular techniques or specialized methods, given the difficulties stemming from their small size. In this review, we summarize current in-silico and biochemical strategies for miRNA research to outline the current status of the research techniques now being employed to find a new direction in the field."

        "abstract": "The central nervous system (CNS) is a remarkably complex organ system, requiring an equally complex network of molecular pathways controlling the multitude of diverse, cellular activities. Gene expression is a critical node at which regulatory control of molecular networks is implemented. As such, elucidating the various mechanisms employed in the physiological regulation of gene expression in the CNS is important both for establishing a reference for comparison to the diseased state and for expanding the set of validated drug targets available for disease intervention. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an abundant class of small RNA that mediates potent inhibitory effects on global gene expression. Recent advances have been made in methods employed to study the contribution of these miRNAs to gene expression. Here we review these latest advances and present a methodological workflow from the perspective of an investigator studying the physiological regulation of a gene of interest. We discuss methods for identifying putative miRNA target sites in a transcript of interest, strategies for validating predicted target sites, assays for detecting miRNA expression, and approaches for disrupting endogenous miRNA function. We consider both advantages and limitations, highlighting certain caveats that inform the suitability of a given method for a specific application. Through careful implementation of the appropriate methodologies discussed herein, we are optimistic that important discoveries related to miRNA participation in CNS physiology and dysfunction are on the horizon."

        "abstract": "Dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) is involved in the initiation and progression of several human cancers, including breast cancer (BC), as strong evidence has been found that miRNAs can act as oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes. This review presents the state of the art on the role of miRNAs in the diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy of BC. Based on the results obtained in the last decade, some miRNAs are emerging as biomarkers of BC for diagnosis (i.e., miR-9, miR-10b, and miR-17-5p), prognosis (i.e., miR-148a and miR-335), and prediction of therapeutic outcomes (i.e., miR-30c, miR-187, and miR-339-5p) and have important roles in the control of BC hallmark functions such as invasion, metastasis, proliferation, resting death, apoptosis, and genomic instability. Other miRNAs are of interest as new, easily accessible, affordable, non-invasive tools for the personalized management of patients with BC because they are circulating in body fluids (e.g., miR-155 and miR-210). In particular, circulating multiple miRNA profiles are showing better diagnostic and prognostic performance as well as better sensitivity than individual miRNAs in BC. New miRNA-based drugs are also promising therapy for BC (e.g., miR-9, miR-21, miR34a, miR145, and miR150), and other miRNAs are showing a fundamental role in modulation of the response to other non-miRNA treatments, being able to increase their efficacy (e.g., miR-21, miR34a, miR195, miR200c, and miR203 in combination with chemotherapy)."

Aberrant expression of miRNAs has been linked to developmental abnormalities and human diseases, including cancer and cardiovascular disorders. The recent identification of mechanisms of miRNA biogenesis regulation uncovers that various factors or growth factor signalling pathways control every step of the miRNA biogenesis pathway. Here, we review the mechanisms that control the regulation of miRNA biogenesis discovered in human cells. Further understanding of the mechanisms that control of miRNA biogenesis may allow the development of tools to modulate the expression of specific miRNAs, which is crucial for the development of novel therapies for human disorders derived from aberrant expression of miRNAs."

        "abstract": "Double-stranded RNA can induce the degradation of homologous RNAs in organisms as diverse as protozoa, animals, plants and fungi, resulting in post-transcriptional gene silencing. But in some species, RNA-mediated processes can also lead to translational repression, DNA methylation, heterochromatin formation or DNA elimination. In some situations, amplification of the 'trigger' double-stranded RNA seems to be required for efficient silencing. These findings imply that RNA-mediated mechanisms can control gene expression at both the transcriptional and the post-transcriptional level, and that they can operate in the nuclear and the cytoplasmic compartments."

        "abstract": "Higher plants undergo a transition from a juvenile to an adult phase of vegetative development prior to flowering. Screens for mutants that undergo this transition precociously produced alleles of two genes required for posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS)--SUPPRESSOR OF GENE SILENCING3 (SGS3) and SUPPRESSOR OF GENE SILENCING2(SGS2)/SILENCING DEFECTIVE1 (SDE1)/RNA-DEPENDENT POLYMERASE6 (RDR6). Loss-of-function mutations in these genes have a phenotype similar to that of mutations in the Argonaute gene ZIPPY (ZIP). Epistasis analysis suggests that ZIP, SGS3, SGS2/SDE1/RDR6, and the putative miRNA export receptor, HASTY (HST), operate in the same pathway(s). Microarray analysis revealed a small number of genes whose mRNA is increased in ZIP, SGS3, and SGS2/SDE1/RDR6 mutants, as well as genes that are up-regulated in SGS3 and SGS2/SDE1/RDR6 mutants, but not in ZIP mutants. One of these latter genes (At5g18040) is silenced posttranscriptionally in trans by the sRNA255 family of endogenous, noncoding, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). The increase in At5g18040 mRNA in SGS3 and SGS2/SDE1/RDR6 mutants is attributable to the absence of sRNA255-like siRNAs in these mutants. These results demonstrate a role for endogenous siRNAs in the regulation of gene expression, and suggest that PTGS plays a central role in the temporal control of shoot development in plants."

        "abstract": "Here we describe a set of endogenous short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in Arabidopsis, some of which direct the cleavage of endogenous mRNAs. These siRNAs correspond to both sense and antisense strands of a noncoding RNA (At2g27400) that apparently is converted to double-stranded RNA and then processed in 21 nt increments. These siRNAs differ from previously described regulatory small RNAs in two respects. First, they require components of the cosuppression pathway (RDR6 and SGS3) and also components of the microRNA (miRNA) pathway (AGO1, DCL1, HEN1, and HYL1) but not components needed for heterochromatic siRNAs (DCL3 and RDR2), another class of endogenous plant siRNAs. Second, these siRNAs repress the expression of genes that have little overall resemblance to the genes from which they originate, a characteristic previously reported only for miRNAs. The identification of this silencing pathway provides yet another dimension to posttranscriptional mRNA regulation in plants."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) govern an expanding number of biological and disease processes. Understanding the mechanisms by which the miRNA pathway is regulated, therefore, represents an important area of investigation. We determined that the human miRNA-generating complex is comprised of Dicer and phospho-TRBP isoforms. Phosphorylation of TRBP is mediated by the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) Erk. Expression of phospho-mimic TRBP and TRBP phosphorylation enhanced miRNA production by increasing stability of the miRNA-generating complex. Mitogenic signaling in response to serum and the tumor promoter PMA was dependent on TRBP phosphorylation. These effects were accompanied by a coordinated increase in levels of growth-promoting miRNA and reduced expression of let-7 tumor suppressor miRNA. Conversely, pharmacological inhibition of MAPK/Erk resulted in an anti-growth miRNA profile. Taken together, these studies indicate that the MAPK/Erk pathway regulates the miRNA machinery and suggest a general principle, wherein signaling systems target the miRNA pathway to achieve biological responses."

        "abstract": "The slicer activity of the RNA-induced silencing complex resides within its Argonaute (Ago) component, in which the PIWI domain provides the catalytic residues governing guide-strand mediated site-specific cleavage of target RNA. Here we report on structures of ternary complexes of Thermus thermophilus Ago catalytic mutants with 5'-phosphorylated 21-nucleotide guide DNA and complementary target RNAs of 12, 15 and 19 nucleotides in length, which define the molecular basis for Mg(2+)-facilitated site-specific cleavage of the target. We observe pivot-like domain movements within the Ago scaffold on proceeding from nucleation to propagation steps of guide-target duplex formation, with duplex zippering beyond one turn of the helix requiring the release of the 3'-end of the guide from the PAZ pocket. Cleavage assays on targets of various lengths supported this model, and sugar-phosphate-backbone-modified target strands showed the importance of structural and catalytic divalent metal ions observed in the crystal structures."

        "abstract": "The first step in microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis usually involves cleavage at the base of its fold-back precursor. Here, we describe a non-canonical processing mechanism for miRNAs miR319 and miR159 in Arabidopsis thaliana. We found that their biogenesis begins with the cleavage of the loop, instead of the usual cut at the base of the stem-loop structure. DICER-LIKE 1 (DCL1) proceeds then with three additional cuts until the mature miRNA is released. We further show that the conserved upper stem of the miR319 precursor is essential to organize its biogenesis, whereas sequences below the miRNA/miRNA(*) region are dispensable. In addition, the bulges present in the fold-back structure reduce the accumulation of small RNAs other than the miRNA. The biogenesis of miR319 is conserved in the moss Physcomitrella patens, showing that this processing mechanism is ancient. These results provide new insights into the plasticity of small-RNA pathways."

        "title": "The diverse roles of RNA helicases in RNAi.",
        "abstract": "RNA interference (RNAi) is a regulatory gene silencing system found in nearly all eukaryotic organisms that employs small RNAs, typically 20-25 nucleotides long, to target complementary sequences found in mRNAs. RNA helicases use ATP to unwind double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), and are known to participate at nearly every level of RNA metabolism. A multitude of RNA helicases have been isolated from screens for essential RNAi factors, and even the earliest models of the RNAi pathway have presumed an RNA helicase to function at the level of small RNA duplex unwinding. However, while many components that function in RNAi have been uncovered and characterized, the exact placement in the pathway and ascription of a specific biochemical function of an RNA helicase in RNAi remains elusive. Recent studies have delved deeper into the precise role of some RNA helicases. Surprisingly, these studies have revealed nontraditional roles, which may not even require the helicase activity. Such findings suggest that RNA helicases regulate gene silencing at nearly every level of the RNAi pathways."

Stem cells possess several characteristic properties, including dividing through self-renewing divisions and generating progeny that differentiate to have specialized cell fates. Multiple signaling pathways have been identified which coordinate stem cell proliferation with maintenance and differentiation. Relatively recently, the small, non-protein coding microRNAs (miRNAs) have been identified to function as important regulators in stem cell development. Individual miRNAs are capable of directing the translational repression of many mRNAs targets, generating widespread changes in gene expression. In addition, dysfunction of miRNA expression is commonly associated with cancer development. Cancer stem cells, which are likely responsible for initiating and maintaining tumorigenesis, share many similarities with stem cells and some mechanisms of miRNA function may be in common between these two cell types."

        "abstract": "Posttranscriptional gene regulation by small RNAs and its crucial impact on development, apoptosis, stem cell self-renewal and differentiation gained tremendous scientific attention since the discovery of RNA interference (RNAi) and microRNAs (miRNAs). However, in the last few years, many more examples for regulatory small RNAs were discovered, some of them even with miRNA-like functions. Even though these small RNA molecules were previously thought to be mere artifacts accumulating during the preparation of RNA libraries, advances in sequencing technology revealed that small RNAs derive from hairpin-fold RNA structures, for example. Mirtrons, short hairpin RNAs or small RNAs that are processed from longer non-coding RNAs such as tRNAs or snoRNAs have been found recently and some of them might be involved in the regulation of gene expression in different organisms. Furthermore, small RNAs originating from transposable elements, heterochromatic regions or convergent transcription units forming endogenous short interfering RNAs (endo-siRNAs) are the somatic equivalents of the germline-specific Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) in mediating transposon silencing. This review will focus on several recent findings that have added new aspects to small RNA-guided gene silencing."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are recognized as being central players in many biological processes and cellular pathways. Their roles in disease have been highlighted first by observation of their aberrant expression profiles in human tumors, and then by in vitro and in vivo functional studies in transformed cells and model organisms. One of the most commonly observed features of miRNAs in malignancies is a defect in their production. Although several causes may be associated with this phenomenon, such as upstream oncogenic/tumor-suppressor defects and alterations in the miRNA-processing machinery, epigenetic inactivation is the prime suspect. The number of miRNAs with putative growth-inhibitory functions undergoing promoter CpG island hypermethylation in human cancer is growing fast and more detailed biological studies are necessary. The recognition of miR-124a and miR-34b/c as bona fide tumor-suppressor miRNAs undergoing DNA methylation-associated silencing in a wide spectrum of human neoplasms is a good starting point to be followed by other candidate miRNAs. Most importantly, even at this early stage, the transcriptional repression of miRNAs by hypermethylation of their corresponding promoter loci seems to be a common feature of all human tumors. This will have translational consequences for the management of the disease."

        "abstract": "The great discovery of microRNAs (miRNAs) has revolutionized current cell biology and medical science. miRNAs are small conserved non-coding RNA molecules that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression by targeting the 3' untranslated region of specific messenger RNAs for degradation or translational repression. New members of the miRNA family are being discovered on a daily basis and emerging evidence has demonstrated that miRNAs play a major role in a wide range of developmental process including cell proliferation, cell cycle, cell differentiation, metabolism, apoptosis, developmental timing, neuronal cell fate, neuronal gene expression, brain morphogenesis, muscle differentiation and stem cell division. Moreover, a large number of studies have reported links between alterations of miRNA homeostasis and pathological conditions such as cancer, psychiatric and neurological diseases, cardiovascular disease, and autoimmune disease. Interestingly, in addition, miRNA deficiencies or excesses have been correlated with a number of clinically important diseases ranging from cancer to myocardial infarction. miRNAs can repress the gene translation of hundreds of their targets and are therefore well-positioned to target a multitude of cellular mechanisms. As a consequence of extensive participation in normal functions, it is quite logical to ask the question if abnormalities in miRNAs should have importance in human diseases. Great discoveries and rapid progress in the past few years on miRNAs provide the hope that miRNAs will in the near future have a great potential in the diagnosis and treatment of many diseases. Currently, an explosive literature has focussed on the role of miRNA in human cancer and cardiovascular disease. In this review, I briefly summarize the explosive current studies about involvement of miRNA in various human cancers and cardiovascular disease."

        "abstract": "microRNAs (miRNAs) are an extensive class of newly identified small RNAs, which regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level by mRNA cleavage or translation inhibition. Currently, there are 3,070 miRNAs deposited in the public available miRNA database; these miRNAs were obtained from 43 plant species using both computational (comparative genomics) and experimental (direct cloning and deep sequencing) approaches. Like other signaling molecules, plant miRNAs can also be moved from one tissue to another through the vascular system. These mobile miRNAs may play an important role in plant nutrient homeostasis and response to environmental biotic and abiotic stresses. In addition, miRNAs also control a wide range of biological and metabolic processes, including developmental timing, tissue-specific development, and stem cell maintenance and differentiation. Currently, a majority of plant miRNA-related researches are purely descriptive, and provide no further detailed mechanistic insight into miRNA-mediated gene regulation and other functions. To better understand the function and regulatory mechanisms of plant miRNAs, more strategies need to be employed to investigate the functions of miRNAs and their associated signaling pathways and gene networks. Elucidating the evolutionary mechanism of miRNAs is also important. It is possible to develop a novel miRNA-based biotechnology for improving plant yield, quality and tolerance to environmental biotic and abiotic stresses besides focusing on basic genetic studies."

For example, germ cells in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans choose between mitotic and meiotic division, and between oogenesis and spermatogenesis. Germ-line mitosis depends on a somatic signal that is mediated by a Notch-type signaling pathway. The ego-1 gene was originally identified on the basis of genetic interactions with the receptor in this pathway and was also shown to be required for oogenesis. Here, we provide more insight into the role of ego-1 in germ-line development."

        "abstract": "The C. elegans heterochronic gene pathway consists of a cascade of regulatory genes that are temporally controlled to specify the timing of developmental events. Mutations in heterochronic genes cause temporal transformations in cell fates in which stage-specific events are omitted or reiterated. Here we show that let-7 is a heterochronic switch gene. Loss of let-7 gene activity causes reiteration of larval cell fates during the adult stage, whereas increased let-7 gene dosage causes precocious expression of adult fates during larval stages. let-7 encodes a temporally regulated 21-nucleotide RNA that is complementary to elements in the 3' untranslated regions of the heterochronic genes lin-14, lin-28, lin-41, lin-42 and daf-12, indicating that expression of these genes may be directly controlled by let-7. A reporter gene bearing the lin-41 3' untranslated region is temporally regulated in a let-7-dependent manner. A second regulatory RNA, lin-4, negatively regulates lin-14 and lin-28 through RNA-RNA interactions with their 3' untranslated regions. We propose that the sequential stage-specific expression of the lin-4 and let-7 regulatory RNAs triggers transitions in the complement of heterochronic regulatory proteins to coordinate developmental timing."

        "abstract": "The messenger RNA 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR) plays an important role in regulation of gene expression on the posttranscriptional level. The 3'UTR controls gene expression via orchestrated interaction between the structural components of mRNAs (cis-element) and the specific trans-acting factors (RNA binding proteins and non-coding RNAs). The crosstalk of these factors is based on the binding sequences and/or direct protein-protein interaction, or just functional interaction. Much new evidence that has accumulated supports the idea that several RNA binding factors can bind to common mRNA targets: to the non-overlapping binding sites or to common sites in a competitive fashion. Various factors capable of binding to the same RNA can cooperate or be antagonistic in their actions. The outcome of the collective function of all factors bound to the same mRNA 3'UTR depends on many circumstances, such as their expression levels, affinity to the binding sites, and localization in the cell, which can be controlled by various physiological conditions. Moreover, the functional and/or physical interactions of the factors binding to 3'UTR can change the character of their actions. These interactions vary during the cell cycle and in response to changing physiological conditions. Abnormal functioning of the factors can lead to disease. In this review we will discuss how alterations of these factors or their interaction can affect cancer development and promote or enhance the malignant phenotype of cancer cells. Understanding these alterations and their impact on 3'UTR-directed posttranscriptional gene regulation will uncover promising new targets for therapeutic intervention and diagnostics. We will also discuss emerging new tools in cancer diagnostics and therapy based on 3'UTR binding factors and approaches to improve them."

The loading of Argonaute proteins with small RNAs is aided by a number of auxiliary factors as well as ATP hydrolysis. This review will focus on the mechanisms of Argonaute loading in different organisms. Furthermore, we highlight the versatile functions of small RNA-Argonaute protein complexes in organisms from all three kingdoms of life."

A silencing mechanism similar to PTGS appears to function as an adaptive antiviral response. We demonstrate that the P1/HC-Pro polyprotein encoded by tobacco etch virus functions as a suppressor of PTGS. A locus comprised of a highly expressed beta-glucuronidase (GUS) transgene was shown to exhibit PTGS. Genetic crosses and segregation analyses revealed that a P1/ HC-Pro transgene suppressed PTGS of the GUS sequence. Nuclear transcription assays indicated that the silencing suppression activity of P1/HC-Pro was at the posttranscriptional level. These data reveal that plant viruses can condition enhanced susceptibility within a host through interdiction of a potent defense response."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are approximately 22 nt non-coding RNAs, which regulate gene expression in a sequence-specific manner via translational inhibition or messenger RNA (mRNA) degradation. Since the discovery of their fundamental mechanisms of action, the field of miRNAs has opened a new era in the understanding of small noncoding RNAs. By molecular cloning and bioinformatic approaches, miRNAs have been identified in viruses, plants and animals. miRNAs are predicted to negatively target up to one-third of human mRNAs. Cancer is a complex genetic disease caused by abnormalities in gene structure and expression. Previous studies have heavily focused on protein-coding genes; however, accumulating evidence is revealing an important role of miRNAs in cancer. Epigenetics is defined as mitotically and/or meiotically heritable changes in gene expression that are not accompanied by changes in DNA sequence. Given the critical roles of miRNAs and epigenetics in cancer, characterizing the epigenetic regulation of miRNAs will provide novel opportunities for the development of cancer biomarkers and/or the identification of new therapeutic targets in the foreseeable future."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate target mRNAs through a combination of translational repression and mRNA destabilization, with mRNA destabilization dominating at steady state in the few contexts examined globally. Here, we extend the global steady-state measurements to additional mammalian contexts and find that regardless of the miRNA, cell type, growth condition, or translational state, mRNA destabilization explains most (66%->90%) miRNA-mediated repression. We also determine the relative dynamics of translational repression and mRNA destabilization for endogenous mRNAs as a miRNA is induced. Although translational repression occurs rapidly, its effect is relatively weak, such that by the time consequential repression ensues, the effect of mRNA destabilization dominates. These results imply that consequential miRNA-mediated repression is largely irreversible and provide other insights into the nature of miRNA-mediated regulation. They also simplify future studies, dramatically extending the known contexts and time points for which monitoring mRNA changes captures most of the direct miRNA effects."

To identify these small RNAs with unusual biogenesis, we performed high-throughput sequencing from wild-type, dgcr8Delta/Delta, and dicer1Delta/Delta mESCs. Several of the resulting DGCR8-independent, Dicer-dependent RNAs were noncanonical miRNAs. These derived from mirtrons and a newly identified subclass of miRNA precursors, which appears to be the endogenous counterpart of shRNAs. Our analyses also revealed endogenous siRNAs resulting from Dicer cleavage of long hairpins, the vast majority of which originated from one genomic locus with tandem, inverted short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs). Our results extend the known diversity of mammalian small RNA-generating pathways and show that mammalian siRNAs exist in cell types other than oocytes."

        "abstract": "Neocortical development is a complex process that, at the cellular level, involves tight control of self-renewal, cell fate commitment, survival, differentiation and delamination/migration. These processes require, at the molecular level, the precise regulation of intrinsic signaling pathways and extrinsic factors with coordinated action in a spatially and temporally specific manner. Transcriptional regulation plays an important role during corticogenesis; however, microRNAs (miRNAs) are emerging as important post-transcriptional regulators of various aspects of central nervous system development. miRNAs are a class of small, single-stranded noncoding RNA molecules that control the expression of the majority of protein coding genes (i.e., targets). How do different miRNAs achieve precise control of gene networks during neocortical development? Here, we critically review all the miRNA-target interactions validated in vivo, with relevance to the generation and migration of pyramidal-projection glutamatergic neurons, and for the initial formation of cortical layers in the embryonic development of rodent neocortex. In particular, we focus on convergent miRNA actions, which are still a poorly understood layer of complexity in miRNA signaling, but potentially one of the keys to disclosing how miRNAs achieve the precise coordination of complex biological processes such as neocortical development."

In fungi, plants and several animal systems, RDRs play a key role in RNA-mediated gene silencing [post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) in plants and RNA interference (RNAi) in non-plants] and are indispensable for heterochromatin formation, at least, in Schizosaccharomyces pombe and plants. Recent findings indicate that PTGS, RNAi and heterochromatin formation not only function as host defence mechanisms against invading nucleic acids but are also involved in natural gene regulation.

        "abstract": "Although it is known that the human genome contains hundreds of microRNA (miRNA) genes and that each miRNA can regulate a large number of mRNA targets, the overall effect of miRNAs on mRNA tissue profiles has not been systematically elucidated. Here, we show that predicted human mRNA targets of several highly tissue-specific miRNAs are typically expressed in the same tissue as the miRNA but at significantly lower levels than in tissues where the miRNA is not present. Conversely, highly expressed genes are often enriched in mRNAs that do not have the recognition motifs for the miRNAs expressed in these tissues. Together, our data support the hypothesis that miRNA expression broadly contributes to tissue specificity of mRNA expression in many human tissues. Based on these insights, we apply a computational tool to directly correlate 3' UTR motifs with changes in mRNA levels upon miRNA overexpression or knockdown. We show that this tool can identify functionally important 3' UTR motifs without cross-species comparison."

Changes in the level of insulin and other hormones reflect the nutritional status of the animal to control circulating sugar levels and fat metabolism. Systemic defects in insulin responsiveness can lead to elevated circulating glucose levels and fat accumulation. Here we present evidence that the microRNA miR-278 plays a role in the control of energy homeostasis in Drosophila. miR-278 mutants have elevated insulin production and are correspondingly lean. Despite the elevated insulin levels, miR-278 mutants have elevated circulating sugar, mobilized from adipose-tissue glycogen stores. We provide evidence that miR-278 mutants are insulin resistant and that miR-278 acts through regulation of the expanded transcript."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are predicted to regulate 30% of mammalian protein-encoding genes by interactions with their 3' untranslated regions (UTRs). We use partially complementary siRNAs to investigate the mechanism by which miRNAs mediate translational repression in human cells. Repressed mRNAs are associated with polyribosomes that are engaged in translation elongation, as shown by puromycin sensitivity. The inhibition appears to be postinitiation because translation driven by the cap-independent processes of HCV IRES and CrPV IRES is repressed by short RNAs. Further, metabolic labeling suggests that silencing occurs before completion of the nascent polypeptide chain. In addition, silencing by short RNAs causes a decrease in translational readthrough at a stop codon, and ribosomes on repressed mRNAs dissociate more rapidly after a block of initiation of translation than those on control mRNAs. These results suggest that repression by short RNAs, and thus probably miRNAs, is primarily due to ribosome drop off during elongation of translation."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) comprise 1 to 3% of all vertebrate genes, but their in vivo functions and mechanisms of action remain largely unknown. Zebrafish miR-430 is expressed at the onset of zygotic transcription and regulates morphogenesis during early development. By using a microarray approach and in vivo target validation, we find that miR-430 directly regulates several hundred target messenger RNA molecules (mRNAs). Most targets are maternally expressed mRNAs that accumulate in the absence of miR-430. We also show that miR-430 accelerates the deadenylation of target mRNAs. These results suggest that miR-430 facilitates the deadenylation and clearance of maternal mRNAs during early embryogenesis."

        "abstract": "Deciphering the mechanisms underlying skeletal muscle-cell differentiation in mammals is an important challenge. Cell differentiation involves complex pathways regulated at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Recent observations have revealed the importance of small (20-25 base pair) non-coding RNAs (microRNAs or miRNAs) that are expressed in both lower organisms and in mammals. miRNAs modulate gene expression by affecting mRNA translation or stability. In lower organisms, miRNAs are essential for cell differentiation during development; some miRNAs are involved in maintenance of the differentiated state. Here, we show that miR-181, a microRNA that is strongly upregulated during differentiation, participates in establishing the muscle phenotype. Moreover, our results suggest that miR-181 downregulates the homeobox protein Hox-A11 (a repressor of the differentiation process), thus establishing a functional link between miR-181 and the complex process of mammalian skeletal-muscle differentiation. Therefore, miRNAs can be involved in the establishment of a differentiated phenotype - even when they are not expressed in the corresponding fully differentiated tissue."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are ubiquitous regulators of eukaryotic gene expression. In addition to repressing translation, miRNAs can down-regulate the concentration of mRNAs that contain elements to which they are imperfectly complementary. Using miR-125b and let-7 as representative miRNAs, we show that in mammalian cells this reduction in message abundance is a consequence of accelerated deadenylation, which leads to rapid mRNA decay. The ability of miRNAs to expedite poly(A) removal does not result from decreased translation; nor does translational repression by miRNAs require a poly(A) tail, a 3' histone stem-loop being an effective substitute. These findings suggest that miRNAs use two distinct posttranscriptional mechanisms to down-regulate gene expression."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs have emerged as important modulators of gene expression. Both during development and disease, regulation by miRNAs controls the choice between self-renewal and differentiation, survival and apoptosis and dictates how cells respond to external stimuli. In mouse pluripotent embryonic stem cells, a surprisingly small set of miRNAs, encoded by four polycistronic genes is at the center of such decisions. miR-290-295, miR-302-367, miR-17-92 and miR-106b-25 encode for miRNAs with highly related sequences that seem to control largely overlapping gene sets. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of these miRNAs in the maintenance of 'stemness' and regulation of normal development and have linked the deregulation of their expression to a variety of human diseases."

FMRP is a selective RNA-binding protein which forms a messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complex that associates with polyribosomes. Recently, mRNA ligands associated with FMRP have been identified. However, the mechanism by which FMRP regulates the translation of its mRNA ligands remains unclear. MicroRNAs are small noncoding RNAs involved in translational control. Here we show that in vivo mammalian FMRP interacts with microRNAs and the components of the microRNA pathways including Dicer and the mammalian ortholog of Argonaute 1 (AGO1). Using two different Drosophila melanogaster models, we show that AGO1 is critical for FMRP function in neural development and synaptogenesis. Our results suggest that FMRP may regulate neuronal translation via microRNAs and links microRNAs with human disease."

        "abstract": "RNA interference (RNAi) is a widespread silencing mechanism that acts at both the posttranscriptional and transcriptional levels. Here, we describe the purification of an RNAi effector complex termed RITS (RNA-induced initiation of transcriptional gene silencing) that is required for heterochromatin assembly in fission yeast. The RITS complex contains Ago1 (the fission yeast Argonaute homolog), Chp1 (a heterochromatin-associated chromodomain protein), and Tas3 (a novel protein). In addition, the complex contains small RNAs that require the Dicer ribonuclease for their production. These small RNAs are homologous to centromeric repeats and are required for the localization of RITS to heterochromatic domains. The results suggest a mechanism for the role of the RNAi machinery and small RNAs in targeting of heterochromatin complexes and epigenetic gene silencing at specific chromosomal loci."

We present a computational method for whole-genome prediction of miRNA target genes. The method is validated using known examples. For each miRNA, target genes are selected on the basis of three properties: sequence complementarity using a position-weighted local alignment algorithm, free energies of RNA-RNA duplexes, and conservation of target sites in related genomes. Application to the D. melanogaster, Drosophila pseudoobscura and Anopheles gambiae genomes identifies several hundred target genes potentially regulated by one or more known miRNAs."

As a guide to focused experiments, we provide detailed online information about likely target genes and binding sites in their untranslated regions, organized by miRNA or by gene and ranked by likelihood of match.

        "abstract": "The Arabidopsis HYL1 gene encodes a nuclear double-stranded RNA-binding protein. A knockout mutation of the hyl1 gene is recessive and pleiotropic, causing developmental abnormalities, increasing sensitivity to abscisic acid, and reducing sensitivity to auxin and cytokinin. We report that levels of several microRNAs (miRNAs; miR159, -167, and -171) are reduced in homozygous mutant plants, and levels of two of three tested target mRNAs are elevated. Conversely, the miRNA levels are elevated in plants expressing a HYL1 cDNA from a strong promoter, and the corresponding target RNAs are reduced. These changes result from alterations in the stability of the target RNAs. However, double-stranded RNA-induced posttranscriptional gene silencing is unaffected by the hyl1 mutation. One-third to one-half of the cellular HYL1 protein is in a macromolecular complex, and a GFP-HYL1 fusion protein is found predominantly in the nucleus, although it is observed in both nucleus and cytoplasm in some cells. Within nuclei, HYL1 is associated with subnuclear bodies and ring-like structures. These observations provide evidence that the HYL1 protein is part of a nuclear macromolecular complex that is involved in miRNA-mediated gene regulation. Because hyl1 mutants show marked abnormalities in hormone responses, these results further suggest that miRNA-mediated changes in mRNA stability play a vital role in plant hormone signaling."

Here, we demonstrate that wild-type let-7 microRNA binds in vitro to RNA from the lin-41 3'UTR. This interaction is dependent on two conserved let-7 complementary sites (LCSs). A 27-nucleotide sequence between the LCSs is also necessary for down-regulation in vivo. LCS mutations compensatory to the lesion in let-7(n2853) can partially restore lin-41 3'UTR function in a let-7(n2853) background, providing the first experimental evidence for an animal miRNA binding directly to its validated target in vivo."

        "title": "Exportin 5 is a RanGTP-dependent dsRNA-binding protein that mediates nuclear export of pre-miRNAs.",
        "abstract": "microRNAs (miRNAs) are widespread among eukaryotes, and studies in several systems have revealed that miRNAs can regulate expression of specific genes. Primary miRNA transcripts are initially processed to approximately 70-nucleotide (nt) stem-loop structures (pre-miRNAs), exported to the cytoplasm, further processed to yield approximately 22-nt dsRNAs, and finally incorporated into ribonucleoprotein particles, which are thought to be the active species. Here we study nuclear export of pre-miRNAs and show that the process is saturable and thus carrier-mediated. Export is sensitive to depletion of nuclear RanGTP and, according to this criterion, mediated by a RanGTP-dependent exportin. An unbiased affinity chromatography approach with immobilized pre-miRNAs identified exportin 5 as the pre-miRNA-specific export carrier. We have cloned exportin 5 from Xenopus and demonstrate that antibodies raised against the Xenopus receptor specifically block pre-miRNA export from nuclei of Xenopus oocytes. We further show that exportin 5 interacts with double-stranded RNA in a sequence-independent manner."

        "abstract": "A key step in RNA interference (RNAi) is assembly of the RISC, the protein-siRNA complex that mediates target RNA cleavage. Here, we show that the two strands of an siRNA duplex are not equally eligible for assembly into RISC. Rather, both the absolute and relative stabilities of the base pairs at the 5' ends of the two siRNA strands determine the degree to which each strand participates in the RNAi pathway. siRNA duplexes can be functionally asymmetric, with only one of the two strands able to trigger RNAi. Asymmetry is the hallmark of a related class of small, single-stranded, noncoding RNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs). We suggest that single-stranded miRNAs are initially generated as siRNA-like duplexes whose structures predestine one strand to enter the RISC and the other strand to be destroyed. Thus, the common step of RISC assembly is an unexpected source of asymmetry for both siRNA function and miRNA biogenesis."

        "abstract": "Both microRNAs (miRNA) and small interfering RNAs (siRNA) share a common set of cellular proteins (Dicer and the RNA-induced silencing complex [RISC]) to elicit RNA interference. In the following work, a statistical analysis of the internal stability of published miRNA sequences in the context of miRNA precursor hairpins revealed enhanced flexibility of miRNA precursors, especially at the 5'-anti-sense (AS) terminal base pair. The same trend was observed in siRNA, with functional duplexes displaying a lower internal stability (Delta0.5 kcal/mol) at the 5'-AS end than nonfunctional duplexes. Average internal stability of siRNA molecules retrieved from plant cells after introduction of long RNA sequences also shows this characteristic thermodynamic signature. Together, these results suggest that the thermodynamic properties of siRNA play a critical role in determining the molecule's function and longevity, possibly biasing the steps involved in duplex unwinding and strand retention by RISC."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate expression of their target mRNAs through the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which contains an Argonaute (Ago) family protein as a core component. In Drosophila melanogaster, miRNAs are generally sorted into Ago1-containing RISC (Ago1-RISC). We established a native gel system that can biochemically dissect the Ago1-RISC assembly pathway. We found that miRNA-miRNA* duplexes are loaded into Ago1 as double-stranded RNAs in an ATP-dependent fashion. In contrast, unexpectedly, unwinding of miRNA-miRNA* duplexes is a passive process that does not require ATP or slicer activity of Ago1. Central mismatches direct miRNA-miRNA* duplexes into pre-Ago1-RISC, whereas mismatches in the seed or guide strand positions 12-15 promote conversion of pre-Ago1-RISC into mature Ago1-RISC. Our findings show that unwinding of miRNAs is a precise mirror-image process of target recognition, and both processes reflect the unique geometry of RNAs in Ago proteins."

Currently the exact roles of miRNAs in human development and disease progression remain largely unknown.

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs are a class of non-coding RNAs involved in post-transcriptional control of gene expression, either via degradation or translational inhibition of target mRNAs. Both experimental and computational approaches have been used to identify miRNAs and their target genes. In plants, deep sequencing methods have recently allowed the analysis of small RNA diversity in different species and/or mutants. Most sequencing efforts have been concentrated on the identification of miRNAs and their mRNA targets have been predicted based on complementarity criteria. The recent demonstration that certain plant miRNAs could act partly via inhibition of protein translation certainly opens new fields of analysis for plant miRNA function on a broader group of targets. The roles of conserved miRNAs on target mRNA stability have been analysed in different species and defined common mechanisms in development and stress responses. In contrast, much less is known about expression patterns or functions of non-conserved miRNAs. In this review, we focus on the comparative analyses of plant small RNA diversity and the action of si/miRNAs in post-transcriptional regulation of some key genes involved in root development."

        "abstract": "It has been demonstrated that all the known processes involved in cancer, including apoptosis, proliferation, survival, and metastasis, are regulated by small regulatory noncoding RNAs consisting of approximately 19-25 nucleotides; these are named microRNAs (miRNAs). Both loss and gain of miRNA function contribute to cancer development through the upregulation and silencing, respectively, of different target genes. Experimental evidence indicates that the use of miRNA mimics or anti-microRNAs may represent a powerful therapeutic strategy to interfere with key molecular pathways involved in cancer. This review provides insights about how micro- RNAs act as oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes and how these findings, along with our increasing understanding of miRNA regulation, can be applied to optimize recent miRNA-based technologies and make them suitable for clinical applications."

        "abstract": "As key regulators in cellular functions, microRNAs (miRNAs) themselves need to be tightly controlled. Lin28, a pluripotency factor, was reported to downregulate let-7 miRNA by inducing uridylation of let-7 precursor (pre-let-7). But the enzyme responsible for the uridylation remained unknown. Here we identify a noncanonical poly (A) polymerase, TUTase4 (TUT4), as the uridylyl transferase for pre-let-7. Lin28 recruits TUT4 to pre-let-7 by recognizing a tetra-nucleotide sequence motif (GGAG) in the terminal loop. TUT4 in turn adds an oligouridine tail to the pre-let-7, which blocks Dicer processing. Other miRNAs with the same sequence motif (miR-107, -143, and -200c) are regulated through the same mechanism. Knockdown of TUT4 and Lin28 reduces the level of stem cell markers, suggesting that they are required for stem cell maintenance. This study uncovers the role of TUT4 and Lin28 as specific suppressors of miRNA biogenesis, which has implications for stem cell research and cancer biology."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that are expressed in higher eukaryoates and have even been found in viral genomes. They usually act as endogenous repressors of target genes by either inhibiting translation, causing mRNA degradation, or by a combination of both mechanisms. More than 850 mature miRNA sequences have been identified in humans, and although this accounts for less than 2% of human genes, it is predicted that 30% of mRNAs are targeted by miRNAs. miRNAs play critical roles in most cellular processes including development, differentiation, and the homeostasis of both a cell and an organism. Moreover, many disease states, including cancer, occur or are sustained by miRNA dysregulation. In this article, the latest reports of miRNA involvement and aberrant expression in human disease are reviewed, with an emphasis on cancer."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression in plants and animals. Although their biological importance has become clear, how they recognize and regulate target genes remains less well understood. Here, we systematically evaluate the minimal requirements for functional miRNA-target duplexes in vivo and distinguish classes of target sites with different functional properties. Target sites can be grouped into two broad categories. 5' dominant sites have sufficient complementarity to the miRNA 5' end to function with little or no support from pairing to the miRNA 3' end. Indeed, sites with 3' pairing below the random noise level are functional given a strong 5' end. In contrast, 3' compensatory sites have insufficient 5' pairing and require strong 3' pairing for function. We present examples and genome-wide statistical support to show that both classes of sites are used in biologically relevant genes. We provide evidence that an average miRNA has approximately 100 target sites, indicating that miRNAs regulate a large fraction of protein-coding genes and that miRNA 3' ends are key determinants of target specificity within miRNA families."

        "abstract": "Emerging evidence suggests that microRNA, which are well-conserved, abundant and small regulatory RNA, may be involved in the pathogenesis of human cancers. We recently reported that expression of let-7 was frequently reduced in lung cancers, and that reduced let-7 expression was significantly associated with shorter patient survival. Two members of the double-stranded RNA-specific endonuclease family, Dicer and Drosha, convert precursor forms of microRNA into their mature forms using a stepwise process. In the present study, we examined expression levels of these genes in 67 non-small cell lung cancer cases, and found for the first time that Dicer expression levels were reduced in a fraction of lung cancers with a significant prognostic impact on the survival of surgically treated cases. It should be noted that multivariate COX regression analysis showed that the prognostic impact of Dicer (P=0.001) appears to be independent of disease stage (P=0.001), while logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the higher incidence of reduced Dicer expression in poorly differentiated tumors remained significant even after correction for other parameters (P=0.02). Given the fundamental and multiple biological roles of Dicer in various cellular processes, our results suggest the involvement of reduced Dicer expression in the development of lung cancers, thus warranting further investigations of the underlying mechanisms, which can be expected to enhance understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of this fatal cancer."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are key regulators of all important biological processes, including development, differentiation, and cancer. Although remarkable progress has been made in deciphering the mechanisms used by miRNAs to regulate translation, many contradictory findings have been published that stimulate active debate in this field. Here we contribute to this discussion in three ways. First, based on a comprehensive analysis of the existing literature, we hypothesize a model in which all proposed mechanisms of microRNA action coexist, and where the apparent mechanism that is detected in a given experiment is determined by the relative values of the intrinsic characteristics of the target mRNAs and associated biological processes. Among several coexisting miRNA mechanisms, the one that will effectively be measurable is that which acts on or changes the sensitive parameters of the translation process. Second, we have created a mathematical model that combines nine known mechanisms of miRNA action and estimated the model parameters from the literature. Third, based on the mathematical modeling, we have developed a computational tool for discriminating among different possible individual mechanisms of miRNA action based on translation kinetics data that can be experimentally measured (kinetic signatures). To confirm the discriminatory power of these kinetic signatures and to test our hypothesis, we have performed several computational experiments with the model in which we simulated the coexistence of several miRNA action mechanisms in the context of variable parameter values of the translation."

CUC1 and CUC2 are redundantly required for the formation of boundaries between organ primordia. The analysis of transgenic plants that either overexpress miR164a or miR164b or express a miRNA-resistant version of CUC1 or CUC2 has shown that miRNA regulation of CUC1 and CUC2 is necessary for normal flower development.

The siRNA pathway is antiviral, whereas an emerging role for miRNAs is in the control of development. Here, we describe a virulence factor encoded by turnip yellow mosaic virus, p69, which suppresses the siRNA pathway but promotes the miRNA pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana. p69 suppression of the siRNA pathway is upstream of dsRNA and is as effective as genetic mutations in A. thaliana genes involved in dsRNA production. Possibly as a consequence of p69 suppression, p69-expressing plants contained elevated levels of a Dicer mRNA and of miRNAs as well as a correspondingly enhanced miRNA-guided cleavage of two host mRNAs. Because p69-expressing plants exhibited disease-like symptoms in the absence of viral infection, our findings suggest a novel mechanism for viral virulence by promoting the miRNA-guided inhibition of host gene expression."

        "abstract": "Comprehensive identification of all functional elements encoded in the human genome is a fundamental need in biomedical research. Here, we present a comparative analysis of the human, mouse, rat and dog genomes to create a systematic catalogue of common regulatory motifs in promoters and 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs). The promoter analysis yields 174 candidate motifs, including most previously known transcription-factor binding sites and 105 new motifs. The 3'-UTR analysis yields 106 motifs likely to be involved in post-transcriptional regulation. Nearly one-half are associated with microRNAs (miRNAs), leading to the discovery of many new miRNA genes and their likely target genes. Our results suggest that previous estimates of the number of human miRNA genes were low, and that miRNAs regulate at least 20% of human genes. The overall results provide a systematic view of gene regulation in the human, which will be refined as additional mammalian genomes become available."

        "title": "Mutations that lead to reiterations in the cell lineages of C. elegans.",
        "abstract": "Cells in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans arise from invariant cell lineages. Mutations in two genes, unc-86 and lin-4, alter multiple and mutually exclusive sets of these lineages. In these mutants, particular cells repeat division patterns normally associated with their parental or grandparental progenitors. The effects of unc-86 are highly specific, altering in equivalent ways the lineages of three post-embryonic neuroblasts that in the wild-type undergo similar division patterns. The effects of lin-4 are more varied, resulting in a number of types of lineage reiterations as well as in supernumerary molts and the continued synthesis of larval-specific cuticle. The reiteration of a given cell division or pattern of cell divisions leads to the repeated generation of cells indistinguishable (by both light and electron microscopy) from those produced after the same division or pattern of cell divisions in the wild-type. This correlation between lineage history and cell fate suggests that in C. elegans a particular sequence of cell divisions may be necessary for the generation of a particular cell type. Reiterative lineages, often referred to as stem cell lineages, may be basic to the development of nematodes and other organisms. We suggest that the wild-type unc-86 and lin-4 genes act to modify latent reiterative cell lineages, which are revealed when the activity of one of these genes is eliminated."

        "title": "MicroRNAs as regulators of mammalian hematopoiesis.",
        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an abundant class of approximately 22 nucleotide non-coding RNAs and play important regulatory roles in animal and plant development at the post-transcriptional level. Many miRNAs cloned from mouse bone marrow cells are differentially regulated in various hematopoietic lineages, suggesting that they might influence hematopoietic lineage differentiation. miR-181, a miRNA specifically expressed in B cells within mouse bone marrow, promotes B-cell differentiation when expressed in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Some human miRNAs are linked to leukemias: the miR-15a/miR-16 locus is frequently deleted or down-regulated in patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia and miR-142 is at a translocation site found in a case of aggressive B-cell leukemia. Collectively, these results indicate that miRNAs may be important regulators of mammalian hematopoiesis. Here, we provide background on the biogenesis and function of miRNAs and discuss how miRNA-mediated post-transcriptional regulation may influence the development and function of blood cells."

        "abstract": "In eukaryotes, short RNAs play a crucial regulatory role in many processes including development, maintenance of genome stability and antiviral responses. These different but overlapping RNA-guided pathways are collectively termed 'RNA silencing'. To counteract an antiviral RNA silencing response, plant viruses express silencing suppressor proteins. Recent results have shown that silencing suppressors operate by modifying the accumulation and/or activity of short RNAs involved in the antiviral response. Because RNA silencing pathways intersect, silencing suppressors can also inhibit other short-RNA-regulated pathways. Thus, suppressors contribute to viral symptoms. These findings fuel further research to test whether certain symptoms caused by animal viruses are also manifestations of altered RNA regulatory pathways."

        "abstract": "The let-7 microRNA is phylogenetically conserved and temporally expressed in many animals. C. elegans let-7 controls terminal differentiation in a stem cell-like lineage in the hypodermis, while human let-7 has been implicated in lung cancer. To elucidate let-7's role in temporal control of nematode development, we used sequence analysis and reverse genetics to identify candidate let-7 target genes. We show that the nuclear hormone receptor daf-12 is a let-7 target in seam cells, while the forkhead transcription factor pha-4 is a target in the intestine. Additional likely targets are the zinc finger protein die-1 and the putative chromatin remodeling factor lss-4. Together with the previous identification of the hunchback ortholog hbl-1 as a let-7 target in the ventral nerve cord, our findings show that let-7 acts in at least three tissues to regulate different transcription factors, raising the possibility of let-7 as a master temporal regulator."

In animals, miRNAs regulate genes by attenuating protein translation through imperfect base pair binding to 3' UTR sequences of target genes. A major challenge in understanding the regulatory role of miRNAs is to accurately predict regulated targets. We have developed an algorithm for predicting targets that does not rely on evolutionary conservation. As one of the features of this algorithm, we incorporate the folded structure of mRNA. By using Drosophila miRNAs as a test case, we have validated our predictions in 10 of 15 genes tested. One of these validated genes is mad as a target for bantam. Furthermore, our computational and experimental data suggest that miRNAs have fewer targets than previously reported."

        "abstract": "We show that the microRNA miR-155 can be processed from sequences present in BIC RNA, a spliced and polyadenylated but non-protein-coding RNA that accumulates in lymphoma cells. The precursor of miR-155 is likely a transient spliced or unspliced nuclear BIC transcript rather than accumulated BIC RNA, which is primarily cytoplasmic. By using a sensitive and quantitative assay, we find that clinical isolates of several types of B cell lymphomas, including diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), have 10- to 30-fold higher copy numbers of miR-155 than do normal circulating B cells. Similarly, the quantities of BIC RNA are elevated in lymphoma cells, but ratios of the amounts of the two RNAs are not constant, suggesting that the level of miR-155 is controlled by transcription and processing. Significantly higher levels of miR-155 are present in DLBCLs with an activated B cell phenotype than with the germinal center phenotype. Because patients with activated B cell-type DLBCL have a poorer clinical prognosis, quantification of this microRNA may be diagnostically useful."

        "title": "Nuclear processing and export of microRNAs in Arabidopsis.",
        "abstract": "In mammalian cells, the nuclear export receptor, Exportin 5 (Exp5), exports pre-microRNAs (pre-miRNAs) as well as tRNAs into the cytoplasm. In this study, we examined the function of HASTY (HST), the Arabidopsis ortholog of Exp5, in the biogenesis of miRNAs and tRNAs. In contrast to mammals, we found that miRNAs exist as single-stranded 20- to 21-nt molecules in the nucleus in Arabidopsis. This observation is consistent with previous studies indicating that proteins involved in miRNA biogenesis are located in the nucleus in Arabidopsis. Although miRNAs exist in the nucleus, a majority accumulate in the cytoplasm. Interestingly, loss-of-function mutations in HST reduced the accumulation of most miRNAs but had no effect on the accumulation of tRNAs and endogenous small interfering RNAs, or on transgene silencing. In contrast, a mutation in PAUSED (PSD), the Arabidopsis ortholog of the tRNA export receptor, Exportin-t, interfered with the processing of tRNA-Tyr but did not affect the accumulation or nuclear export of miRNAs. These results demonstrate that HST and PSD do not share RNA cargos in nuclear export and strongly suggest that there are multiple nuclear export pathways for these small RNAs in Arabidopsis."

Here we describe the molecular mechanism of target RNA cleavage using affinity-purified minimal RISC from human cells. Cleavage proceeds via hydrolysis and the release of a 3'-hydroxyl and a 5'-phosphate terminus. Substitution of the 2'-hydroxyl group at the cleavage site by 2'-deoxy had no significant effect, suggesting that product release and/or a conformational transition rather than a chemical step is rate-limiting. Substitution by 2'-O-methyl at the cleavage site substantially reduced cleavage, which is presumably due to steric interference. Mutational analysis of the target RNA revealed that mismatches across from the 5' or the 3' end of the siRNA had little effect and that substrate RNAs as short as 15 nucleotides were cleaved by RISC."

We find that miR-196, a miRNA encoded at three paralogous locations in the A, B, and C mammalian HOX clusters, has extensive, evolutionarily conserved complementarity to messages of HOXB8, HOXC8, and HOXD8. RNA fragments diagnostic of miR-196-directed cleavage of HOXB8 were detected in mouse embryos. Cell culture experiments demonstrated down-regulation of HOXB8, HOXC8, HOXD8, and HOXA7 and supported the cleavage mechanism for miR-196-directed repression of HOXB8. These results point to a miRNA-mediated mechanism for the posttranscriptional restriction of HOX gene expression during vertebrate development and demonstrate that metazoan miRNAs can repress expression of their natural targets through mRNA cleavage in addition to inhibiting productive translation."

        "abstract": "Of the over 200 identified mammalian microRNAs (miRNAs), only a few have known biological activity. To gain a better understanding of the role that miRNAs play in specific cellular pathways, we utilized antisense molecules to inhibit miRNA activity. We used miRNA inhibitors targeting miR-23, 21, 15a, 16 and 19a to test efficacy of antisense molecules in reducing miRNA activity on reporter genes bearing miRNA-binding sites. The miRNA inhibitors de-repressed reporter gene activity when a miRNA-binding site was cloned into its 3'-untranslated region. We employed a library of miRNA inhibitors to screen for miRNA involved in cell growth and apoptosis. In HeLa cells, we found that inhibition of miR-95, 124, 125, 133, 134, 144, 150, 152, 187, 190, 191, 192, 193, 204, 211, 218, 220, 296 and 299 caused a decrease in cell growth and that inhibition of miR-21 and miR-24 had a profound increase in cell growth. On the other hand, inhibition of miR-7, 19a, 23, 24, 134, 140, 150, 192 and 193 down-regulated cell growth, and miR-107, 132, 155, 181, 191, 194, 203, 215 and 301 increased cell growth in lung carcinoma cells, A549. We also identified miRNA that when inhibited increased the level of apoptosis (miR-1d, 7, 148, 204, 210, 216 and 296) and one miRNA that decreased apoptosis (miR-214) in HeLa cells. From these screens, we conclude that miRNA-mediated regulation has a complexity of cellular outcomes and that miRNAs can be mediators of regulation of cell growth and apoptosis pathways."

        "title": "microRNAs exhibit high frequency genomic alterations in human cancer.",
        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous noncoding RNAs, which negatively regulate gene expression. To determine genomewide miRNA DNA copy number abnormalities in cancer, 283 known human miRNA genes were analyzed by high-resolution array-based comparative genomic hybridization in 227 human ovarian cancer, breast cancer, and melanoma specimens. A high proportion of genomic loci containing miRNA genes exhibited DNA copy number alterations in ovarian cancer (37.1%), breast cancer (72.8%), and melanoma (85.9%), where copy number alterations observed in >15% tumors were considered significant for each miRNA gene. We identified 41 miRNA genes with gene copy number changes that were shared among the three cancer types (26 with gains and 15 with losses) as well as miRNA genes with copy number changes that were unique to each tumor type. Importantly, we show that miRNA copy changes correlate with miRNA expression. Finally, we identified high frequency copy number abnormalities of Dicer1, Argonaute2, and other miRNA-associated genes in breast and ovarian cancer as well as melanoma. These findings support the notion that copy number alterations of miRNAs and their regulatory genes are highly prevalent in cancer and may account partly for the frequent miRNA gene deregulation reported in several tumor types."

        "title": "Translation repression in human cells by microRNA-induced gene silencing requires RCK/p54.",
        "abstract": "RNA interference is triggered by double-stranded RNA that is processed into small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) by Dicer enzyme. Endogenously, RNA interference triggers are created from small noncoding RNAs called microRNAs (miRNAs). RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISC) in human cells can be programmed by exogenously introduced siRNA or endogenously expressed miRNA. siRNA-programmed RISC (siRISC) silences expression by cleaving a perfectly complementary target mRNA, whereas miRNA-induced silencing complexes (miRISC) inhibits translation by binding imperfectly matched sequences in the 3' UTR of target mRNA. Both RISCs contain Argonaute2 (Ago2), which catalyzes target mRNA cleavage by siRISC and localizes to cytoplasmic mRNA processing bodies (P-bodies). Here, we show that RCK/p54, a DEAD box helicase, interacts with argonaute proteins, Ago1 and Ago2, in affinity-purified active siRISC or miRISC from human cells; directly interacts with Ago1 and Ago2 in vivo, facilitates formation of P-bodies, and is a general repressor of translation. Disrupting P-bodies by depleting Lsm1 did not affect RCK/p54 interactions with argonaute proteins and its function in miRNA-mediated translation repression. Depletion of RCK/p54 disrupted P-bodies and dispersed Ago2 throughout the cytoplasm but did not significantly affect siRNA-mediated RNA functions of RISC. Depleting RCK/p54 released general, miRNA-induced, and let-7-mediated translational repression. Therefore, we propose that translation repression is mediated by miRISC via RCK/p54 and its specificity is dictated by the miRNA sequence binding multiple copies of miRISC to complementary 3' UTR sites in the target mRNA. These studies also suggest that translation suppression by miRISC does not require P-body structures, and location of miRISC to P-bodies is the consequence of translation repression."

One of these, miR-127, is embedded in a CpG island and is highly induced from its own promoter after treatment. miR-127 is usually expressed as part of a miRNA cluster in normal cells but not in cancer cells, suggesting that it is subject to epigenetic silencing. In addition, the proto-oncogene BCL6, a potential target of miR-127, was translationally downregulated after treatment. These results suggest that DNA demethylation and histone deacetylase inhibition can activate expression of miRNAs that may act as tumor suppressors."

        "abstract": "Small RNAs ranging in size between 18 and 30 nucleotides (nt) are found in many organisms including yeasts, plants, and animals. Small RNAs are involved in the regulation of gene expression through translational repression, mRNA degradation, and chromatin modification. In mammals, microRNAs (miRNAs) are the only small RNAs that have been well characterized. Here, we have identified two novel classes of small RNAs in the mouse germline. One class consists of approximately 20- to 24-nt small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) from mouse oocytes, which are derived from retroelements including LINE, SINE, and LTR retrotransposons. Addition of retrotransposon-derived sequences to the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of a reporter mRNA destabilizes the mRNA significantly when injected into full-grown oocytes. These results suggest that retrotransposons are suppressed through the RNAi pathway in mouse oocytes. The other novel class of small RNAs is 26- to 30-nt germline small RNAs (gsRNAs) from testes. gsRNAs are expressed during spermatogenesis in a developmentally regulated manner, are mapped to the genome in clusters, and have strong strand bias. These features are reminiscent of Tetrahymena approximately 23- to 24-nt small RNAs and Caenorhabditis elegans X-cluster small RNAs. A conserved novel small RNA pathway may be present in diverse animals."

They are expressed during spermatogenesis, mostly in spermatids. piRNAs are associated with MIWI, a spermatogenesis-specific PIWI subfamily member of the Argonaute protein family, and depend on MIWI for their biogenesis and/or stability.

Here we review the strategies used by viruses to evade the immunity controlled by 21- to 26-nt small RNAs. Viral suppressors of RNA silencing (VSRs) are encoded by genetically diverse viruses infecting plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates. VSRs target key steps in the small RNA pathways by inhibiting small RNA production, sequestering small RNAs, or preventing short- and long-distance spread of RNA silencing. However, although VSRs are required for infection, explicit data demonstrating a role of silencing suppression in virus infection are available only for a few VSRs. A subset of VSRs bind double-stranded RNA, but a distinct protein fold is revealed for each of the four VSRs examined. We propose that VSR families are evolved independently as a viral adaptation to immunity. Unresolved issues on the role of RNA silencing in virus-host interactions are highlighted."

Several classes of endogenous short RNAs have partial or near perfect complementarity to mRNAs and a protein complex is guided by short RNAs to target mRNAs. The targeted mRNA is either cleaved or its translation is suppressed.

        "title": "Relief of microRNA-mediated translational repression in human cells subjected to stress.",
        "abstract": "In metazoans, most microRNAs imperfectly base-pair with the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of target mRNAs and prevent protein accumulation by either repressing translation or inducing mRNA degradation. Examples of specific mRNAs undergoing microRNA-mediated repression are numerous, but whether the repression is a reversible process remains largely unknown. Here we show that cationic amino acid transporter 1 (CAT-1) mRNA and reporters bearing its 3'UTR can be relieved from the microRNA miR-122-induced inhibition in human hepatocarcinoma cells subjected to different stress conditions. The derepression of CAT-1 mRNA is accompanied by its release from cytoplasmic processing bodies and its recruitment to polysomes. The derepression requires binding of HuR, an AU-rich-element binding protein, to the 3'UTR of CAT-1 mRNA. We propose that proteins interacting with the 3'UTR will generally act as modifiers altering the potential of miRNAs to repress gene expression."

        "abstract": "Small noncoding RNAs regulate processes essential for cell growth and development, including mRNA degradation, translational repression, and transcriptional gene silencing (TGS). During a search for candidate mammalian factors for TGS, we purified a complex that contains small RNAs and Riwi, the rat homolog to human Piwi. The RNAs, frequently 29 to 30 nucleotides in length, are called Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), 94% of which map to 100 defined (< or = 101 kb) genomic regions. Within these regions, the piRNAs generally distribute across only one genomic strand or distribute on two strands but in a divergent, nonoverlapping manner. Preparations of piRNA complex (piRC) contain rRecQ1, which is homologous to qde-3 from Neurospora, a gene implicated in silencing pathways. Piwi has been genetically linked to TGS in flies, and slicer activity cofractionates with the purified complex. These results are consistent with a gene-silencing role for piRC in mammals."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) represent a newly identified class of non-protein-coding approximately 20nt small RNAs which play important roles in multiple biological processes by degrading targeted mRNAs or repressing mRNA translation. After searching a genomic survey sequence database using homologs and secondary structures, we found 188 maize miRNAs belonging to 29 miRNA families. Of the 188 maize miRNA genes, 28 (15%) were found in at least one EST. A total of 115 potential targets were identified for 26 of the miRNA families based on the fact that miRNAs exhibit perfect or nearly perfect complementarity with their target sequences. A majority of the targets are transcription factors which play important roles in maize development, including leaf, shoot, and root development. Additionally, these maize miRNAs are also involved in other cellular processes, such as signal transduction, stress response, sucrose and cellulose synthesis, and ubiquitin protein degradation pathway. Some of the newly identified miRNA targets may be unique to maize."

        "abstract": "Diverse forms of injury and stress evoke a hypertrophic growth response in adult cardiac myocytes, which is characterized by an increase in cell size, enhanced protein synthesis, assembly of sarcomeres, and reactivation of fetal genes, often culminating in heart failure and sudden death. Given the emerging roles of microRNAs (miRNAs) in modulation of cellular phenotypes, we searched for miRNAs that were regulated during cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. We describe >12 miRNAs that are up- or down-regulated in cardiac tissue from mice in response to transverse aortic constriction or expression of activated calcineurin, stimuli that induce pathological cardiac remodeling. Many of these miRNAs were similarly regulated in failing human hearts. Forced overexpression of stress-inducible miRNAs was sufficient to induce hypertrophy in cultured cardiomyocytes. Similarly, cardiac overexpression of miR-195, which was up-regulated during cardiac hypertrophy, resulted in pathological cardiac growth and heart failure in transgenic mice. These findings reveal an important role for specific miRNAs in the control of hypertrophic growth and chamber remodeling of the heart in response to pathological signaling and point to miRNAs as potential therapeutic targets in heart disease."

        "abstract": "Argonaute (AGO) proteins interact with small RNAs to mediate gene silencing. C. elegans contains 27 AGO genes, raising the question of what roles these genes play in RNAi and related gene-silencing pathways. Here we describe 31 deletion alleles representing all of the previously uncharacterized AGO genes. Analysis of single- and multiple-AGO mutant strains reveals functions in several pathways, including (1) chromosome segregation, (2) fertility, and (3) at least two separate steps in the RNAi pathway. We show that RDE-1 interacts with trigger-derived sense and antisense RNAs to initiate RNAi, while several other AGO proteins interact with amplified siRNAs to mediate downstream silencing. Overexpression of downstream AGOs enhances silencing, suggesting that these proteins are limiting for RNAi. Interestingly, these AGO proteins lack key residues required for mRNA cleavage. Our findings support a two-step model for RNAi, in which functionally and structurally distinct AGOs act sequentially to direct gene silencing."

A highly conserved pathway of miRNA biogenesis is closely linked to the transport and translatability of mRNAs in neurons. Although there are nearly 500 known human miRNA sequences, each of only approximately 21 nucleotides, which bind to multiple mRNA targets, the accurate prediction of miRNA targets seems to lie just beyond our grasp. Nevertheless, the identification of such targets promises to provide new insights into many facets of neuronal function."

A fraction of Argonaute proteins and miRNAs biochemically cosediment with polyribosomes, yet another fraction paradoxically accumulates in ribosome-free processing bodies (PBs) in the cytoplasm. In this report, we give a quantitative account of the Argonaute protein localization and dynamics in living cells in different cellular states. We find that the majority of Argonaute is distributed diffusely in the cytoplasm, and, when cells are subjected to stress, Argonaute proteins accumulate to newly assembled structures known as stress granules (SGs) in addition to PBs. Argonaute proteins displayed distinct kinetics at different structures: exchange faster at SGs and much slower at PBs. Further, miRNAs are required for the Argonaute protein localization to SGs but not PBs. These quantitative kinetic data provide insights into miRNA-mediated repression."

They play important roles in multiple biological and metabolic processes, including developmental timing, signal transduction, cell maintenance and differentiation, diseases and cancers. miRNAs regulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level by directly cleaving targeted mRNAs or repressing translation. Although the founding members of miRNAs were discovered by genetic screening approaches, experimental approaches were limited by their low efficiency, time consuming, and high cost. As an alternative, computational approaches were developed. Computational approaches for identifying miRNAs are based on the following major characteristics of miRNAs: hairpin-shaped secondary structures, high conservation for some miRNAs, and high minimal folding free energy index (MFEI). Computational approaches also play an important role in identifying miRNA targets. A majority of known miRNAs and their targets were identified by computational approaches. Several web-based or non-web-based computer software programs are publicly available for predicting miRNAs and their targets."

        "title": "Distinct populations of primary and secondary effectors during RNAi in C. elegans.",
        "abstract": "RNA interference (RNAi) is a phylogenetically widespread gene-silencing process triggered by double-stranded RNA. In plants and Caenorhabditis elegans, two distinct populations of small RNAs have been proposed to participate in RNAi: \"Primary siRNAs\" (derived from DICER nuclease-mediated cleavage of the original trigger) and \"secondary siRNAs\" [additional small RNAs whose synthesis requires an RNA-directed RNA polymerase (RdRP)]. Analyzing small RNAs associated with ongoing RNAi in C. elegans, we found that secondary siRNAs constitute the vast majority. The bulk of secondary siRNAs exhibited structure and sequence indicative of a biosynthetic mode whereby each molecule derives from an independent de novo initiation by RdRP. Analysis of endogenous small RNAs indicated that a fraction derive from a biosynthetic mechanism that is similar to that of secondary siRNAs formed during RNAi, suggesting that small antisense transcripts derived from cellular messenger RNAs by RdRP activity may have key roles in cellular regulation."

The mechanism by which human let-7a miRNA regulates mRNA translation was examined in HeLa cells expressing reporter mRNAs containing the Caenorhabditis elegans lin-41 3' UTR. let-7a miRNA strongly repressed translation, yet the majority of control and lin-41-bearing RNAs sedimented with polyribosomes in sucrose gradients; these polyribosomes, together with let-7a miRNA and the miRISC protein AGO, were released from those structures by puromycin. RNA containing the lin-41 3' UTR and an iron response element in the 5' UTR sedimented with polysomes when cells were incubated with iron, but showed ribosome run-off when the iron was chelated. These data indicate that let-7a miRNA inhibits actively translating polyribosomes. Nascent polypeptide coimmunoprecipitation experiments further suggest that let-7a miRNA interferes with the accumulation of growing polypeptides."

        "abstract": "Argonaute (AGO) proteins bind to small RNAs and mediate small RNA-induced silencing in eukaryotes. Using a minimal in vitro system, we show that bacterially expressed human AGO1 and AGO2 but not AGO3 and AGO4 possess strand-dissociating activity of microRNA (miRNA) duplexes. Both AGO1 and AGO2 function as RNA chaperones, capable of performing multiple rounds of strand dissociation. Unexpectedly, both AGO1 and AGO2 demonstrate passenger strand cleavage activity of a small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplex, but only AGO2 has target RNA cleavage activity. These observations indicate that passenger strand and mRNA endonuclease activities are mechanistically distinct. We further validate these observations in mammalian extracts and cultured mammalian cells, in which we demonstrate that AGO1 uses only miRNA duplexes when assembling translational repression-competent complexes, whereas AGO2 can use both miRNA and siRNA duplexes. We show that passenger strand cleavage and RNA chaperone activities that are intrinsic to both AGO1 and AGO2 are sufficient for RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) loading."

We found that treatment of chronically infected chimpanzees with a locked nucleic acid (LNA)-modified oligonucleotide (SPC3649) complementary to miR-122 leads to long-lasting suppression of HCV viremia, with no evidence of viral resistance or side effects in the treated animals. Furthermore, transcriptome and histological analyses of liver biopsies demonstrated derepression of target mRNAs with miR-122 seed sites, down-regulation of interferon-regulated genes, and improvement of HCV-induced liver pathology. The prolonged virological response to SPC3649 treatment without HCV rebound holds promise of a new antiviral therapy with a high barrier to resistance."

        "abstract": "The assembly of RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) is a key process in small RNA-mediated gene silencing. In humans, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) are incorporated into RISCs containing the Argonaute (AGO) subfamily proteins Ago1-4. Previous studies have proposed that, unlike Drosophila melanogaster RISC assembly pathways, human RISC assembly is coupled with dicing and is independent of ATP. Here we show by careful reexamination that, in humans, RISC assembly and dicing are uncoupled, and ATP greatly facilitates RISC loading of small-RNA duplexes. Moreover, all four human AGO proteins show remarkably similar structural preferences for small-RNA duplexes: central mismatches promote RISC loading, and seed or 3'-mid (guide position 12-15) mismatches facilitate unwinding. All these features of human AGO proteins are highly reminiscent of fly Ago1 but not fly Ago2."

        "abstract": "Plant microRNAs (miRNAs) affect only a small number of targets with high sequence complementarity, while animal miRNAs usually have hundreds of targets with limited complementarity. We used artificial miRNAs (amiRNAs) to determine whether the narrow action spectrum of natural plant miRNAs reflects only intrinsic properties of the plant miRNA machinery or whether it is also due to past selection against natural miRNAs with broader specificity. amiRNAs were designed to target individual genes or groups of endogenous genes. Like natural miRNAs, they had varying numbers of target mismatches. Previously determined parameters of target selection for natural miRNAs could accurately predict direct targets of amiRNAs. The specificity of amiRNAs, as deduced from genome-wide expression profiling, was as high as that of natural plant miRNAs, supporting the notion that extensive base pairing with targets is required for plant miRNA function. amiRNAs make an effective tool for specific gene silencing in plants, especially when several related, but not identical, target genes need to be downregulated. We demonstrate that amiRNAs are also active when expressed under tissue-specific or inducible promoters, with limited nonautonomous effects. The design principles for amiRNAs have been generalized and integrated into a Web-based tool (http://wmd.weigelworld.org)."

The biophysical properties of LNA were exploited to design probe sets for uniform, high-affinity hybridizations yielding highly accurate signals able to discriminate between single nucleotide differences and, hence, between closely related miRNA family members. The superior detection sensitivity eliminates the need for RNA size selection and/or amplification. MiChip will greatly simplify miRNA expression profiling of biological and clinical samples."

        "abstract": "We have developed an approach to identify microRNAs (miRNAs) that is based on bioinformatics and array-based technologies, without the use of cDNA cloning. The approach, designed for use on genomes of small size (<2 Mb), was tested on cells infected by either of two lymphotropic herpesviruses, KSHV and EBV. The viral genomes were scanned computationally for pre-miRNAs using an algorithm (VMir) we have developed. Candidate hairpins suggested by this analysis were then synthesized as oligonucleotides on microarrays, and the arrays were hybridized with small RNAs from infected cells. Candidate miRNAs that scored positive on the arrays were then subjected to confirmatory Northern blot analysis. Using this approach, 10 of the known KSHV pre-miRNAs were identified, as well as a novel pre-miRNA that had earlier escaped detection. This method also led to the identification of seven new EBV-encoded pre-miRNAs; by using additional computational approaches, we identified a total of 18 new EBV pre-miRNAs that produce 22 mature miRNA molecules, thereby more than quadrupling the total number of hitherto known EBV miRNAs. The advantages and limitations of the approach are discussed."

To discover novel regulatory pathways during megakaryocytic differentiation, we performed microRNA expression profiling of in vitro-differentiated megakaryocytes derived from CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitors. The main finding was down-regulation of miR-10a, miR-126, miR-106, miR-10b, miR-17 and miR-20. Hypothetically, the down-regulation of microRNAs unblocks target genes involved in differentiation. We confirmed in vitro and in vivo that miR-130a targets the transcription factor MAFB, which is involved in the activation of the GPIIB promoter, a key protein for platelet physiology. In addition, we found that miR-10a expression in differentiated megakaryocytes is inverse to that of HOXA1, and we showed that HOXA1 is a direct target of miR-10a. Finally, we compared the microRNA expression of megakaryoblastic leukemic cell lines with that of in vitro differentiated megakaryocytes and CD34(+) progenitors. This analysis revealed up-regulation of miR-101, miR-126, miR-99a, miR-135, and miR-20. Our data delineate the expression of microRNAs during megakaryocytopoiesis and suggest a regulatory role of microRNAs in this process by targeting megakaryocytic transcription factors."

Micro (mi)RNAs are small regulatory RNAs that are emerging as important regulators of cell division/differentiation and human cancer genes. In this review, the miRNA cancer connection is discussed and the possibility of using this novel, but potentially powerful new therapy, involving miRNAs, to treat cancers is speculated on. For example, lung cancer is the major cause of cancer deaths in the USA, but existing therapies fail to treat this disease in the overwhelming majority of cases. The let-7 miRNA is one of a number of 'oncomirs', natural miRNA tumor suppressors in lung tissue, which may prove useful in treating lung cancer or enhancing current treatments for lung cancer."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are emerging as master regulators of gene expression in the nervous system where they contribute not only to brain development but also to neuronal network homeostasis and plasticity. Their function is the result of a cascade of events including miRNA biogenesis, target recognition, and translation inhibition. It has been suggested that miRNAs are major switches of the genome owing to their ability to regulate multiple genes at the same time. This regulation is essential for normal neuronal activity and, when affected, can lead to drastic pathological conditions. As an example, we illustrate how deregulation of miRNAs can affect neuronal plasticity leading to chronic pain. The origin of pain and its dual role as a key physiological function and a debilitating disease has been highly debated until now. The incidence of chronic pain is estimated to be 20-25% worldwide, thus making it a public health problem. Chronic pain can be considered as a form of maladaptive plasticity. Long-lasting modifications develop as a result of global changes in gene expression, and are thus likely to be controlled by miRNAs. Here, we review the literature on miRNAs and their targets responsible for maladaptive plasticity in chronic pain conditions. In addition, we conduct a retrospective analysis of miRNA expression data published for different pain models, taking into account recent progress in our understanding of the role of miRNAs in neuronal plasticity."

Plants have evolved a large variety of pathways over the Dicer-AGO consortium, which most likely underpins part of their phenotypic plasticity. Dicer-like proteins produce all known classes of plant silencing sRNAs, which are invariably stabilized via 2'-O-methylation mediated by HUA ENHANCER 1 (HEN1), potentially amplified by the action of several RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, and function through a variety of AGO proteins. Here, we review the known characteristics and biochemical properties of the core silencing factors found in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. We also describe how interactions between these core factors and more specialized proteins allow the production of a plethora of silencing sRNAs involved in a large array of biological functions. We emphasize in particular the biogenesis and activities of silencing sRNAs of endogenous origin."

The RNA silencing-based antiviral defence involves the production of virus-derived small interfering RNAs and their association to effector proteins, which together drive the sequence specific inactivation of viruses. The entire process of antiviral defence 'borrows' several plant factors involved in other specialized RNA silencing endogenous pathways. Different viruses use variable strategies to infect different host plants, which render the antiviral RNA silencing a complex phenomenon far to be completely clarified. This chapter reports current advances in understanding the main steps of the plant's RNA-silencing response to viral invasion and discusses some of the key questions still to be answered."

        "abstract": "Gene expression is a highly controlled process which is known to occur at several levels in eukaryotic organisms. Although RNAs have been traditionally viewed as passive molecules in the pathway from transcription to translation, there is increasing evidence that their metabolism is controlled by a class of small noncoding RNAs called MicroRNAs (miRNAs). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) control essential gene regulatory pathways in both plants and animals however our understanding about their function, evolution and interplay with other cellular components is only beginning to be elucidated. In this chapter, we provide an overview of the recent developments in our understanding of this class of RNAs from diverse perspectives including biogenesis, mechanism of their function, evolution of their clusters, and discuss the approaches currently available for the construction of post-transcriptional networks governed by them. We also present our current understanding on these post-transcriptional networks in the context other cellular networks. We finally argue that such developments would not only allow us to gain a deeper understanding of regulation at a level that has been under-appreciated over the past decades, but would also allow us to use the newly developed high-throughput approaches to interrogate the prevalence of these phenomena in different states, and thereby exploit the functions of these RNA molecules for therapeutic advantage in higher eukaryotes."

        "abstract": "RNA silencing is a mechanism of genetic regulation that is mediated by short noncoding RNAs, or small RNAs (sRNAs). Regulatory interactions are established based on nucleotide sequence complementarity between the sRNAs and their targets. The development of new high-throughput sequencing technologies has accelerated the discovery of sRNAs in a variety of plants and animals. The use of these and other high-throughput technologies, such as microarrays, to measure RNA and protein concentrations of gene products potentially regulated by sRNAs has also been important for their functional characterisation. mRNAs targeted by sRNAs can produce new sRNAs or the protein encoded by the target mRNA can regulate other mRNAs. In either case the targeting sRNAs are parts of complex RNA networks therefore identifying and characterising sRNAs contribute to better understanding of RNA networks. In this chapter we will review RNA silencing, the different types of sRNAs that mediate it and the computational methods that have been developed to use high-throughput technologies in the study of sRNAs and their targets."

        "abstract": "In the last years miRNAs have increasingly been recognised as potent posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression. Possibly, miRNAs exert their action on virtually any biological process by simultaneous regulation of numerous genes. The importance of miRNA-based regulation in health and disease has inspired research to investigate diverse aspects of miRNA origin, biogenesis, and function. Despite the recent rapid accumulation of experimental data, and the emergence of functional models, the complexity of miRNA-based regulation is still far from being well understood. In particular, we lack comprehensive knowledge as to which cellular processes are regulated by which miRNAs, and, furthermore, how temporal and spatial interactions of miRNAs to their targets occur. Results from large-scale functional analyses have immense potential to address these questions. In this review, we discuss the latest progress in application of high-content and high-throughput functional analysis for the systematic elucidation of the biological roles of miRNAs."

        "abstract": "Since the establishment of a canonical animal microRNA biogenesis pathway driven by the RNase III enzymes Drosha and Dicer, an unexpected variety of alternative mechanisms that generate functional microRNAs have emerged. We review here the many Drosha-independent and Dicer-independent microRNA biogenesis strategies characterized over the past few years. Beyond reflecting the flexibility of small RNA machineries, the existence of noncanonical pathways has consequences for interpreting mutants in the core microRNA machinery. Such mutants are commonly used to assess the consequences of \"total\" microRNA loss, and indeed, they exhibit many overall phenotypic similarities. Nevertheless, ongoing studies reveal a growing number of settings in which alternative microRNA pathways contribute to distinct phenotypes among core microRNA biogenesis mutants."

One interesting scenario is that defects in the nuclear export of precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) might occur in transformed cells. Exportin 5 (XPO5) mediates pre-miRNA nuclear export and herein we demonstrate the presence of XPO5-inactivating mutations in a subset of human tumors with microsatellite instability. The XPO5 genetic defect traps pre-miRNAs in the nucleus, reduces miRNA processing, and diminishes miRNA-target inhibition. The XPO5 mutant form lacks a C-terminal region that contributes to the formation of the pre-miRNA/XPO5/Ran-GTP ternary complex and pre-miRNAs accumulate in the nucleus. Most importantly, the restoration of XPO5 functions reverses the impaired export of pre-miRNAs and has tumor-suppressor features."

This decision is partly mediated by miRNA functions, in particular by modulating the amount of miRNAs, the amount of mRNA targets, or the activity/mode of action of miRNA-protein complexes.

Dysregulation of these processes contributes to chronic diseases, including cancers."

        "title": "The role of microRNAs in cancer: no small matter.",
        "abstract": "MicroRNAs are a recently discovered class of small, evolutionarily conserved, RNA molecules that negatively regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Mature microRNAs of approximately 20-22 nucleotides are formed from longer primary transcripts by two sequential processing steps mediated by a nuclear (Drosha) and a cytoplasmic (Dicer) RNAse III endonuclease. In the context of a protein complex, the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), microRNAs base-pair with target messenger RNA sequences causing translational repression and/or messenger RNA degradation. MicroRNAs have been implicated in the control of many fundamental cellular and physiological processes such as tissue development, cellular differentiation and proliferation, metabolic and signalling pathways, apoptosis and stem cell maintenance. Mounting evidence indicates that microRNAs also play a significant role in cellular transformation and carcinogenesis acting either as oncogenes or tumour suppressors. This review briefly introduces microRNAs in a historical perspective and focuses on the biogenesis of microRNAs, their mode of action, mammalian microRNA functions with emphasis on their involvement in disease - particularly cancer - and their potential therapeutic use."

        "title": "RNA helicase A interacts with RISC in human cells and functions in RISC loading.",
        "abstract": "RNA interference is a conserved pathway of sequence-specific gene silencing that depends on small guide RNAs and the action of proteins assembled in the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). Minimally, the action of RISC requires the endonucleolytic slicer activity of Argonaute2 (Ago2) directed to RNA targets whose sequences are complementary to RISC-incorporated small RNA. To identify RISC components in human cells, we developed an affinity-purification strategy to isolate siRNA-programmed RISC. Here we report the identification of RNA helicase A (RHA) as a human RISC-associated factor. We show that RHA interacts in human cells with siRNA, Ago2, TRBP, and Dicer and functions in the RNAi pathway. In RHA-depleted cells, RNAi was reduced as a consequence of decreased intracellular concentration of active RISC assembled with the guide-strand RNA and Ago2. Our results identify RHA as a RISC component and demonstrate that RHA functions in RISC as an siRNA-loading factor."

        "title": "Target mRNAs are repressed as efficiently by microRNA-binding sites in the 5' UTR as in the 3' UTR.",
        "abstract": "In animals, microRNAs (miRNAs) bind to the 3' UTRs of their target mRNAs and interfere with translation, although the exact mechanism of inhibition of protein synthesis remains unclear. Functional miRNA-binding sites in the coding regions or 5' UTRs of endogenous mRNAs have not been identified. We studied the effect of introducing miRNA target sites into the 5' UTR of luciferase reporter mRNAs containing internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs), so that potential steric hindrance by a microribonucleoprotein complex would not interfere with the initiation of translation. In human HeLa cells, which express endogenous let-7a miRNA, the translational efficiency of these IRES-containing reporters with 5' let-7 complementary sites from the Caenorhabditis elegans lin-41 3' UTR was repressed. Similarly, the IRES-containing reporters were translationally repressed when human Ago2 was tethered to either the 5' or 3' UTR. Interestingly, the method of DNA transfection affected our ability to observe miRNA-mediated repression. Our results suggest that association with any position on a target mRNA is mechanistically sufficient for a microribonucleoprotein to exert repression of translation at some step downstream of initiation."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) in eukaryotes guide post-transcriptional regulation by means of targeted RNA degradation and translational arrest. They are released by a Dicer nuclease as a 21-24-nucleotide RNA duplex from a precursor in which an imperfectly matched inverted repeat forms a partly double-stranded region. One of the two strands is then recruited by an Argonaute nuclease that is the effector protein of the silencing mechanism. Short interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which are similar to miRNAs, are also produced by Dicer but the precursors are perfectly double-stranded RNA. These siRNAs guide post-transcriptional regulation, as with miRNAs, and epigenetic genome modification. Diverse eukaryotes including fungi, plants, protozoans and metazoans produce siRNAs but, until now, miRNAs have not been described in unicellular organisms and it has been suggested that they evolved together with multicellularity in separate plant and animal lineages. Here we show that the unicellular alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii contains miRNAs, putative evolutionary precursors of miRNAs and species of siRNAs resembling those in higher plants. The common features of miRNAs and siRNAs in an alga and in higher plants indicate that complex RNA-silencing systems evolved before multicellularity and were a feature of primitive eukaryotic cells."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs are a recently discovered class of small ( approximately 22nt) endogenously expressed translational-repressor RNAs that play key roles in many cellular pathways and whose aberrant expression appears to be a common feature of malignancy. MicroRNAs are expressed in specific haematological cell types and play important regulatory roles in early haematopoietic differentiation, erythropoiesis, granulocytosis, megakaryocytosis and lymphoid development. Additionally, there is an emerging body of research to suggest that microRNAs play an important role in the pathology of haematological malignancies. MicroRNAs have been found to act as both tumour suppressor molecules [e.g. MIRN15A (miR-15a), MIRN16-1 (miR-16-1)] in leukaemias and have oncogenic properties [e.g. MIRN155 (miR-155) and MIRN17-92 (miR-17-miR-92) cluster] in lymphomas. This review discusses the rapidly accumulating research that points to the major role microRNAs play in both haematopoiesis and haematological malignancy."

        "abstract": "p53 is a potent tumor suppressor, whose biological effects are largely due to its function as a transcriptional regulator. Here we report that, in addition to regulating the expression of hundreds of protein-coding genes, p53 also modulates the levels of microRNAs (miRNAs). Specifically, p53 can induce expression of microRNA-34a (miR-34a) in cultured cells as well as in irradiated mice, by binding to a perfect p53 binding site located within the gene that gives rise to miR-34a. Processing of the primary transcript into mature miR-34a involves the excision of a 30 kb intron. Notably, inactivation of miR-34a strongly attenuates p53-mediated apoptosis in cells exposed to genotoxic stress, whereas overexpression of miR-34a mildly increases apoptosis. Hence, miR-34a is a direct proapoptotic transcriptional target of p53 that can mediate some of p53's biological effects. Perturbation of miR-34a expression, as occurs in some human cancers, may thus contribute to tumorigenesis by attenuating p53-dependent apoptosis."

        "abstract": "The p53 tumor suppressor protein is a critical regulator of the cellular response to cancer-initiating insults such as genotoxic stress. In this report, we demonstrate that microRNAs (miRNAs) are important components of the p53 transcriptional network. Global miRNA expression analyses identified a cohort of miRNAs that exhibit p53-dependent upregulation following DNA damage. One such miRNA, miR-34a, is commonly deleted in human cancers and, as shown here, frequently absent in pancreatic cancer cells. Characterization of the miR-34a primary transcript and promoter demonstrates that this miRNA is directly transactivated by p53. Expression of miR-34a causes dramatic reprogramming of gene expression and promotes apoptosis. Much like the known set of p53-regulated genes, miR-34a-responsive genes are highly enriched for those that regulate cell-cycle progression, apoptosis, DNA repair, and angiogenesis. Therefore, it is likely that an important function of miR-34a is the modulation and fine-tuning of the gene expression program initiated by p53."

Although the knockout of components of the miRNA biogenesis pathway has profound phenotypic consequences, most predicted miRNA targets undergo small changes at the mRNA and protein levels when the expression of the miRNA is perturbed. Alternatively, miRNAs can establish thresholds in and increase the coherence of the expression of their target genes, as well as reduce the cell-to-cell variability in target gene expression.

        "title": "Heterochronic genes and the nature of developmental time.",
        "abstract": "Timing is a fundamental issue in development, with a range of implications from birth defects to evolution. In the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans, the heterochronic genes encode components of a molecular developmental timing mechanism. This mechanism functions in diverse cell types throughout the animal to specify cell fates at each larval stage. MicroRNAs play an important role in this mechanism by stage-specifically repressing cell-fate regulators. Recent studies reveal the surprising complexity surrounding this regulation--for example, a positive feedback loop may make the regulation more robust, and certain components of the mechanism are expressed in brief periods at each stage. Other factors reveal the potential for important roles of steroid hormones and targeted proteolysis. Investigation of the heterochronic genes has revealed a mechanism composed of precisely timed switches linked to discrete developmental stages. Timing is a dimension of developmental regulation that may be difficult to witness in vertebrates because developmental stages are not as discrete as in C. elegans, each tissue is likely to be independently regulated. Homologs of certain heterochronic genes of vertebrates show temporally regulated expression patterns, and may ultimately reveal timing mechanisms not previously known to exist."

        "title": "Differential regulation of microRNAs by p53 revealed by massively parallel sequencing: miR-34a is a p53 target that induces apoptosis and G1-arrest.",
        "abstract": "In a genome-wide screen for microRNAs regulated by the transcription factor encoded by the p53 tumor suppressor gene we found that after p53-activation the abundance of thirty-four miRNAs was significantly increased, whereas sixteen miRNAs were suppressed. The induction of miR-34a was most pronounced among all differential regulations. Also expression of the primary miR-34a transcript was induced after p53 activation and by DNA damage in a p53-dependent manner. p53 occupied an evolutionarily conserved binding site proximal to the first non-coding exon of miR-34a. Ectopic miR-34a induced apoptosis and a cell cycle arrest in the G1-phase, thereby suppressing tumor cell proliferation. Other p53-induced miRNAs identified here may also have tumor suppressive potential as they are known to suppress the anti-apoptotic factor Bcl2 (miR-15a/16) and the oncogenes RAS and HMGA2 (let-7a). Our results for the first time directly integrate the regulation of miRNA expression into the transcriptional network regulated by p53. siRNAs corresponding to p53-induced miRNAs may have potential as cancer therapeutic agents as RNA interference based therapies are currently emerging."

        "abstract": "A global decrease in microRNA (miRNA) levels is often observed in human cancers, indicating that small RNAs may have an intrinsic function in tumour suppression. To identify miRNA components of tumour suppressor pathways, we compared miRNA expression profiles of wild-type and p53-deficient cells. Here we describe a family of miRNAs, miR-34a-c, whose expression reflected p53 status. Genes encoding miRNAs in the miR-34 family are direct transcriptional targets of p53, whose induction by DNA damage and oncogenic stress depends on p53 both in vitro and in vivo. Ectopic expression of miR-34 induces cell cycle arrest in both primary and tumour-derived cell lines, which is consistent with the observed ability of miR-34 to downregulate a programme of genes promoting cell cycle progression. The p53 network suppresses tumour formation through the coordinated activation of multiple transcriptional targets, and miR-34 may act in concert with other effectors to inhibit inappropriate cell proliferation."

        "abstract": "In RNA interference (RNAi), double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is processed into short interfering RNA (siRNA) to mediate sequence-specific gene knockdown. The genetics of plant RNAi is not understood, nor are the bases for its spreading between cells. Here, we unravel the requirements for biogenesis and action of siRNAs directing RNAi in Arabidopsis thaliana and show how alternative routes redundantly mediate this process under extreme dsRNA dosages. We found that SMD1 and SMD2, required for intercellular but not intracellular RNAi, are allelic to RDR2 and NRPD1a, respectively, previously implicated in siRNA-directed heterochromatin formation through the action of DCL3 and AGO4. However, neither DCL3 nor AGO4 is required for non-cell autonomous RNAi, uncovering a new pathway for RNAi spreading or detection in recipient cells. Finally, we show that the genetics of RNAi is distinct from that of antiviral silencing and propose that this experimental silencing pathway has a direct endogenous plant counterpart."

        "abstract": "hnRNP A1 is an RNA-binding protein involved in various aspects of RNA processing. Use of an in vivo cross-linking and immunoprecipitation protocol to find hnRNP A1 RNA targets resulted in the identification of a microRNA (miRNA) precursor, pre-miR-18a. This microRNA is expressed as part of a cluster of intronic RNAs, including miR-17, miR-18a, miR-19a, miR-20a, miR-19b-1 and miR-92, and potentially acts as an oncogene. Here we show that hnRNP A1 binds specifically to the primary RNA sequence pri-miR-18a before Drosha processing. HeLa cells depleted of hnRNP A1 have reduced in vitro processing activity with pri-miR-18a and also show reduced abundances of endogenous pre-miR-18a. Furthermore, we show that hnRNP A1 is required for miR-18a-mediated repression of a target reporter in vivo. These results underscore a previously uncharacterized role for general RNA-binding proteins as auxiliary factors that facilitate the processing of specific miRNAs."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are regulatory molecules that participate in diverse biological processes in animals and plants. While thousands of mammalian genes are potentially targeted by miRNAs, the functions of miRNAs in the context of gene networks are not well understood. Specifically, it is unknown whether miRNA-containing networks have recurrent circuit motifs, as has been observed in regulatory networks of bacteria and yeast. Here we develop a computational method that utilizes gene expression data to show that two classes of circuits-corresponding to positive and negative transcriptional coregulation of a miRNA and its targets-are prevalent in the human and mouse genomes. Additionally, we find that neuronal-enriched miRNAs tend to be coexpressed with their target genes, suggesting that these miRNAs could be involved in neuronal homeostasis. Our results strongly suggest that coordinated transcriptional and miRNA-mediated regulation is a recurrent motif to enhance the robustness of gene regulation in mammalian genomes."

        "abstract": "Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) induce sequence-specific gene silencing in mammalian cells and guide mRNA degradation in the process of RNA interference (RNAi). By targeting endogenous lamin A/C mRNA in human HeLa or mouse SW3T3 cells, we investigated the positional variation of siRNA-mediated gene silencing. We find cell-type-dependent global effects and cell-type-independent positional effects. HeLa cells were about 2-fold more responsive to siRNAs than SW3T3 cells but displayed a very similar pattern of positional variation of lamin A/C silencing. In HeLa cells, 26 of 44 tested standard 21-nucleotide (nt) siRNA duplexes reduced the protein expression by at least 90%, and only 2 duplexes reduced the lamin A/C proteins to <50%. Fluorescent chromophores did not perturb gene silencing when conjugated to the 5'-end or 3'-end of the sense siRNA strand and the 5'-end of the antisense siRNA strand, but conjugation to the 3'-end of the antisense siRNA abolished gene silencing. RNase-protecting phosphorothioate and 2'-fluoropyrimidine RNA backbone modifications of siRNAs did not significantly affect silencing efficiency, although cytotoxic effects were observed when every second phosphate of an siRNA duplex was replaced by phosphorothioate. Synthetic RNA hairpin loops were subsequently evaluated for lamin A/C silencing as a function of stem length and loop composition. As long as the 5'-end of the guide strand coincided with the 5'-end of the hairpin RNA, 19-29 base pair (bp) hairpins effectively silenced lamin A/C, but when the hairpin started with the 5'-end of the sense strand, only 21-29 bp hairpins were highly active."

ZIP encodes ARGONAUTE7 (AGO7), one of ten members of the ARGONAUTE family in Arabidopsis. In addition to playing developmental roles, some ARGONAUTE family members are required for RNAi-like phenomena, such as posttranscriptional gene silencing.

        "abstract": "lin-4 and let-7 are founding members of an extensive family of genes that produce small transcripts, termed microRNAs (miRNAs). In Caenorhabditis elegans, lin-4 and let-7 control the timing of postembryonic events by translational repression of target genes, permitting progression from early to late developmental programs. To identify Drosophila melanogaster miRNAs that could play similar roles in the control of developmental timing, we characterized the developmental expression profile of 24 miRNAs in Drosophila, and found 7 miRNAs that are either upregulated or downregulated in conjunction with metamorphosis. The upregulation of three of these miRNAs (mir-100, mir-125, and let-7), and the downregulation of a fourth (mir-34) requires the hormone ecdysone (Ecd) and the activity of the Ecd-inducible gene Broad-Complex. Interestingly, mir-125 is a putative homologue of lin-4. mir-100, -125, and let-7 are clustered within an 800-bp region on chromosome 2L, suggesting that these three miRNAs may be coordinately regulated via common cis-acting elements during metamorphosis. In S2 cells, Ecd and the juvenile hormone analog methoprene exert opposite effects on the expression of these four miRNAs, indicating the participation of both these hormones in the temporal regulation of mir-34, -100, -125, and let-7 expression in vivo."

Here we report target-selected inactivation of the dicer1 gene in zebrafish. We observed an initial build-up of miRNA levels, produced by maternal Dicer1, in homozygous dicer1 mutants, but miRNA accumulation stopped after a few days. This resulted in developmental arrest around day 10. These results indicate that miRNA-producing Dicer1 is essential for vertebrate development."

Loss of Dicer1 lead to lethality early in development, with Dicer1-null embryos depleted of stem cells.

        "title": "Regulation of flowering time and floral organ identity by a MicroRNA and its APETALA2-like target genes.",
        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are approximately 21-nucleotide noncoding RNAs that have been identified in both animals and plants. Although in animals there is direct evidence implicating particular miRNAs in the control of developmental timing, to date it is not known whether plant miRNAs also play a role in regulating temporal transitions. Through an activation-tagging approach, we demonstrate that miRNA 172 (miR172) causes early flowering and disrupts the specification of floral organ identity when overexpressed in Arabidopsis. miR172 normally is expressed in a temporal manner, consistent with its proposed role in flowering time control. The regulatory target of miR172 is a subfamily of APETALA2 (AP2) transcription factor genes. We present evidence that miR172 downregulates these target genes by a translational mechanism rather than by RNA cleavage. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function analyses indicate that two of the AP2-like target genes normally act as floral repressors, supporting the notion that miR172 regulates flowering time by downregulating AP2-like target genes."

        "abstract": "A new paradigm of RNA-directed gene expression regulation has emerged recently, profound in scope but arresting in the apparent simplicity of its core mechanism. Cells express numerous small ( approximately 22 nucleotide) RNAs that act as specificity determinants to direct destruction or translational repression of their mRNA targets. These small RNAs arise from processing of double-stranded RNA by the Dicer nuclease and incorporate with proteins that belong to the Argonaute family. Small RNAs might also target and silence homologous DNA sequences. The immense potential of small RNAs as controllers of gene networks is just beginning to unfold."

Loss of KANADI activity results in similar alterations in vascular patterning as compared to REVOLUTA gain-of-function alleles. Simultaneous loss-of-function of PHABULOSA, PHAVOLUTA, and REVOLUTA abaxializes cotyledons, abolishes the formation of the primary apical meristem, and in severe cases, eliminates bilateral symmetry; these phenotypes implicate these three genes in radial patterning of both embryonic and postembryonic growth."

In this paper, we reviewed three main small RNA species which appear to affect spermatogenesis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are single stand RNAs derived from transcripts containing stem-loops and hairpins which target corresponding mRNAs and affect their stability or translation. Many miRNA species have been found to be related to normal male germ cell development. The biogenesis of piRNAs is still largely unknown but several models have been proposed. Some piRNAs and PIWIs target transposable elements and it is these that may be active in regulating translation or stem cell maintenance. endo-siRNAs may also participate in sperm development. Some possible interactions between different kinds of small RNAs have even been suggested. We also show that male germ granules are seen to have a close relationship with a considerable number of mRNAs and small RNAs. Those special structures may also participate in sperm development."

Argonaute binding alters the properties of an RNA guide, creating functional domains. We show that the domains established by Argonaute-the anchor, seed, central, 3' supplementary, and tail regions-have distinct biochemical properties that explain the differences between how animal miRNAs and siRNAs bind their targets. Extensive complementarity between an siRNA and its target slows the rate at which fly Argonaute2 (Ago2) binds to and dissociates from the target. Highlighting its role in antiviral defense, fly Ago2 dissociates so slowly from extensively complementary target RNAs that essentially every fully paired target is cleaved. Conversely, mouse AGO2, which mainly mediates miRNA-directed repression, dissociates rapidly and with similar rates for fully paired and seed-matched targets. Our data narrow the range of biochemically reasonable models for how Argonaute-bound siRNAs and miRNAs find, bind, and regulate their targets."

        "abstract": "A canonical biogenesis pathway involving sequential cleavage by the Drosha and Dicer RNAse III enzymes governs the maturation of most animal microRNAs. However, there exist a variety of alternative miRNA biogenesis pathways, most of which bypass Drosha processing. Recently, three groups described for the first time a vertebrate microRNA pathway that bypasses Dicer cleavage. This mechanism was characterized with respect to the highly conserved vertebrate gene mir-451, for which Drosha processing yields a short (42 nucleotide) hairpin that is directly loaded into Ago2, the sole vertebrate \"Slicer\" Argonaute. Ago2-mediated cleavage of this hairpin yields a 30 nucleotide intermediate, whose 3' end is resected to generate the dominantly cloned ~23 nucleotide mature miR-451. Knowledge of this pathway provides an unprecedented tool with which to express microRNAs and small interfering RNAs in Dicer mutant cells. More generally, the mir-451 backbone constitutes a new platform for gene silencing that complements existing shRNA technology."

        "title": "Involvement of microRNAs in physiological and pathological processes in the lung.",
        "abstract": "To date, at least 900 different microRNA (miRNA) genes have been discovered in the human genome. These short, single-stranded RNA molecules originate from larger precursor molecules that fold to produce hairpin structures, which are subsequently processed by ribonucleases Drosha/Pasha and Dicer to form mature miRNAs. MiRNAs play role in the posttranscriptional regulation of about one third of human genes, mainly via degradation of target mRNAs. Whereas the target mRNAs are often involved in the regulation of diverse physiological processes ranging from developmental timing to apoptosis, miRNAs have a strong potential to regulate fundamental biological processes also in the lung compartment. However, the knowledge of the role of miRNAs in physiological and pathological conditions in the lung is still limited. This review, therefore, summarizes current knowledge of the mechanism, function of miRNAs and their contribution to lung development and homeostasis. Besides the involvement of miRNAs in pulmonary physiological conditions, there is evidence that abnormal miRNA expression may lead to pathological processes and development of various pulmonary diseases. Next, the review describes current state-of-art on the miRNA expression profiles in smoking-related diseases including lung cancerogenesis, in immune system mediated pulmonary diseases and fibrotic processes in the lung. From the current research it is evident that miRNAs may play role in the posttranscriptional regulation of key genes in human pulmonary diseases. Further studies are, therefore, necessary to explore miRNA expression profiles and their association with target mRNAs in human pulmonary diseases."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that serve as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression. They work predominantly by binding to complementary sequences in target messenger RNA (mRNA) 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) where they prevent translation or cause degradation of the message. Steroid hormone receptors (SHRs) are ligand-activated transcription factors that regulate genes in steroid responsive tissues. Recent studies demonstrate that SHRs regulate miRNAs, and in turn, miRNAs can regulate SHR expression and function. Mounting evidence indicates that miRNAs are intimately involved with SHRs, as they are with other transcription factors, often in double negative feedback loops. Investigators are just beginning to expose the details of these complex relationships and reveal the extent to which miRNAs are involved with SHRs in normal physiology and the pathobiology of steroid hormone responsive tissues."

        "title": "Improved targeting of miRNA with antisense oligonucleotides.",
        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of 20-24 nt noncoding RNAs that regulate target mRNAs post-transcriptionally by binding with imperfect complementarity in the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) and inhibiting translation or RNA stability. Current understanding of miRNA biology is limited, and antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) inhibition is a powerful technique for miRNA functionalization in vitro and in vivo, and for therapeutic targeting of miRNAs. Identification of optimal ASO chemistries for targeting miRNAs is therefore of great interest. We evaluated a number of 2'-sugar and backbone ASO modifications for their ability to inhibit miR-21 activity on a luciferase reporter mRNA. ASO modifications that improved target affinity improved miRNA ASO activity, yet the positioning of high-affinity modifications also had dramatically different effects on miRNA activity, suggesting that more than affinity determined the effectiveness of the miRNA ASOs. We present data in which the activity of a modified miRNA ASO was inversely correlated to its tolerability as an siRNA passenger strand, suggesting that a similar mechanism could be involved in the dissociation of miRNA ASOs and siRNA passenger strands. These studies begin to define the factors important for designing improved miRNA ASOs, enabling more effective miRNA functionalization and therapeutic targeting."

        "abstract": "Double-stranded RNA has been shown to induce gene silencing in diverse eukaryotes and by a variety of pathways. We have examined the taxonomic distribution and the phylogenetic relationship of key components of the RNA interference (RNAi) machinery in members of five eukaryotic supergroups. On the basis of the parsimony principle, our analyses suggest that a relatively complex RNAi machinery was already present in the last common ancestor of eukaryotes and consisted, at a minimum, of one Argonaute-like polypeptide, one Piwi-like protein, one Dicer, and one RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. As proposed before, the ancestral (but non-essential) role of these components may have been in defense responses against genomic parasites such as transposable elements and viruses. From a mechanistic perspective, the RNAi machinery in the eukaryotic ancestor may have been capable of both small-RNA-guided transcript degradation as well as transcriptional repression, most likely through histone modifications. Both roles appear to be widespread among living eukaryotes and this diversification of function could account for the evolutionary conservation of duplicated Argonaute-Piwi proteins. In contrast, additional RNAi-mediated pathways such as RNA-directed DNA methylation, programmed genome rearrangements, meiotic silencing by unpaired DNA, and miRNA-mediated gene regulation may have evolved independently in specific lineages."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in development and regulate the expression of many animal genes by post-transcriptional gene silencing. Here we describe the cloning and expression of new miRNAs from zebrafish. By high-throughput sequencing of small-RNA cDNA libraries from 5-day-old zebrafish larvae and adult zebrafish brain we found 139 known miRNAs and 66 new miRNAs. For 65 known miRNAs and for 11 new miRNAs we also cloned the miRNA star sequence. We analyzed the temporal and spatial expression patterns for 35 new miRNAs and for 32 known miRNAs in the zebrafish by whole mount in situ hybridization and northern blotting. Overall, 23 of the 35 new miRNAs and 30 of the 32 known miRNAs could be detected. We found that most miRNAs were expressed during later stages of development. Some were expressed ubiquitously, but many of the miRNAs were expressed in a tissue-specific manner. Most newly discovered miRNAs have low expression levels and are less conserved in other vertebrate species. Our cloning and expression analysis indicates that most abundant and conserved miRNAs in zebrafish are now known."

        "abstract": "Small RNAs have several important biological functions. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) and trans-acting small interfering RNAs (tasiRNAs) regulate mRNA stability and translation, and siRNAs cause post-transcriptional gene silencing of transposons, viruses and transgenes and are important in both the establishment and maintenance of cytosine DNA methylation. Here, we study the role of the four Arabidopsis thaliana DICER-LIKE genes (DCL1-DCL4) in these processes. Sequencing of small RNAs from a dcl2 dcl3 dcl4 triple mutant showed markedly reduced tasiRNA and siRNA production and indicated that DCL1, in addition to its role as the major enzyme for processing miRNAs, has a previously unknown role in the production of small RNAs from endogenous inverted repeats. DCL2, DCL3 and DCL4 showed functional redundancy in siRNA and tasiRNA production and in the establishment and maintenance of DNA methylation. Our studies also suggest that asymmetric DNA methylation can be maintained by pathways that do not require siRNAs."

        "abstract": "Breast cancer, the most common cancer among women, is a heterogeneous and complex disease, which detail of its precise progression mechanisms is less understood. So, an improved comprehension of the precise molecular mechanisms leading to disease progression and design of effective targeted therapies are required for patients with breast cancer. MicroRNAs demonstrate an uncovered class of small and endogenous non-coding RNAs and play an important role in the normal biological processes, including cell differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis. Some miRNAs, known as oncomiR, show different expression levels in cancer and are capable to effect on cellular transformation, carcinogenesis and metastasis and are characterized by high expression levels in tumors compared to normal tissues. Therefore, oncomiRs can be considered as prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets in different types of cancers. Moreover, the utilization of oncomiRs as therapeutic targets for cancer is promising. Accordingly, there is evidence which implies an important role of various oncogenic microRNAs in immunopathogenesis of breast cancer. In this review we will discuss about the role of various oncomiRs such as miR-21, miR-155, miR-10b, and miR-221/222 in the pathogenesis and treatment of breast cancer."

        "abstract": "microRNAs (miRNAs) are a large class of endogenous short RNAs that repress gene expression. Many miRNAs are conserved throughout evolution, and dysregulation of miRNA pathways has been correlated with an increasing number of human diseases. In animals, miRNAs typically bind to the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of target mRNAs with imperfect sequence complementarity and repress translation. Despite their importance in regulating biological processes in numerous organisms, the mechanisms of miRNA function are largely unknown. Here, we report in vitro reactions for miRNA-directed translational gene silencing. These reactions faithfully recapitulate known in vivo hallmarks of mammalian miRNA function, including a requirement for a 5' phosphate and perfect complementarity to the mRNA target in the 5' seed region. Translational gene silencing by miRNAs in vitro requires target mRNAs to possess a 7-methyl G cap and a polyA tail, whereas increasing polyA tail length alone can increase miRNA silencing activity."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small regulatory RNAs that are essential in all studied metazoans. Research has focused on the prediction and identification of novel miRNAs, while little has been done to validate, annotate, and characterize identified miRNAs. Using Illumina sequencing, \u223c20 million small RNA sequences were obtained from Caenorhabditis elegans. Of the 175 miRNAs listed on the miRBase database, 106 were validated as deriving from a stem-loop precursor with hallmark characteristics of miRNAs. This result suggests that not all sequences identified as miRNAs belong in this category of small RNAs. Our large data set of validated miRNAs facilitated the determination of general sequence and structural characteristics of miRNAs and miRNA precursors. In contrast to previous observations, we did not observe a preference for the 5' nucleotide of the miRNA to be unpaired compared to the 5' nucleotide of the miRNA*, nor a preference for the miRNA to be on either the 5' or 3' arm of the miRNA precursor stem-loop. We observed that steady-state pools of miRNAs have fairly homogeneous termini, especially at their 5' end. Nearly all mature miRNA-miRNA* duplexes had two nucleotide 3' overhangs, and there was a preference for a uracil in the first and ninth position of the mature miRNA. Finally, we observed that specific nucleotides and structural distortions were overrepresented at certain positions adjacent to Drosha and Dicer cleavage sites. Our study offers a comprehensive data set of C. elegans miRNAs and their precursors that significantly decreases the uncertainty associated with the identity of these molecules in existing databases."

Oncogenic miRNAs may facilitate cell cycle entry and progression by targeting CDK inhibitors or transcriptional repressors of the retinoblastoma family. On the other hand, tumor suppressor miRNAs induce cell cycle arrest by downregulating multiple components of the cell cycle machinery. Recent data also suggest that miRNAs act co-ordinately with transcriptional factors involved in cell cycle regulation such as c-MYC, E2F or p53. These miRNAs not only can potentiate the function of these factors but they may also limit the excessive translation of cell cycle proteins upon mitogenic or oncogenic stimuli to protect cells from replicative stress. The implications of these regulatory networks in cell proliferation and human disease are discussed."

In plants, a minority of annotated MIRNA gene families are conserved between plant families, while the majority are family- or species-specific, suggesting that most known MIRNA genes arose relatively recently in evolutionary time. Given the high proportion of young MIRNA genes in plant species, new MIRNA families are likely spawned and then lost frequently. Unlike highly conserved, ancient miRNAs, young miRNAs are often weakly expressed, processed imprecisely, lack targets, and display patterns of neutral variation, suggesting that young MIRNA loci tend to evolve neutrally. Genome-wide analyses from several plant species have revealed that variation in miRNA foldback expression, structure, processing efficiency, and miRNA size have resulted in the unique functionality of MIRNA loci and resulting miRNAs. Additionally, some miRNAs have evolved specific properties and functions that regulate other transcriptional or posttranscriptional silencing pathways. The evolution of miRNA processing and functional diversity underscores the dynamic nature of miRNA-based regulation in complex regulatory networks."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that control the expression of many target messenger RNAs (mRNAs) involved in normal cell functions (differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis). Consequently their aberrant expression and/or functions are related to pathogenesis of many human diseases including cancers. Haematopoiesis is a highly regulated process controlled by a complex network of molecular mechanisms that simultaneously regulate commitment, differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). Alterations on this network could affect the normal haematopoiesis, leading to the development of haematological malignancies such as lymphomas. The incidence of lymphomas is rising and a significant proportion of patients are refractory to standard therapies. Accurate diagnosis, prognosis and therapy still require additional markers to be used for diagnostic and prognostic purpose and evaluation of clinical outcome. The dysregulated expression or function of miRNAs in various types of lymphomas has been associated with lymphoma pathogenesis. Indeed, many recent findings suggest that almost all lymphomas seem to have a distinct and specific miRNA profile and some miRNAs are related to therapy resistance or have a distinct kinetics during therapy. MiRNAs are easily detectable in fresh or paraffin-embedded diagnostic tissue and serum where they are highly stable and quantifiable within the diagnostic laboratory at each consultation. Accordingly they could be specific biomarkers for lymphoma diagnosis, as well as useful for evaluating prognosis or disease response to the therapy, especially for evaluation of early relapse detection and for greatly assisting clinical decisions making. Here we summarize the current knowledge on the role of miRNAs in normal and aberrant lymphopoiesis in order to highlight their clinical value as specific diagnosis and prognosis markers of lymphoid malignancies or for prediction of therapy response. Finally, we discuss their controversial therapeutic role and future applications in therapy by modulating miRNA."

        "abstract": "As part of their innate immune response against viral infections, mammals activate the expression of type I interferons to prevent viral replication and dissemination. An antiviral RNAi-based response can be also activated in mammals, suggesting that several mechanisms can co-occur in the same cell and that these pathways must interact to enable the best antiviral response. Here, we will review how the classical type I interferon response and the recently described antiviral RNAi pathways interact in mammalian cells. Specifically, we will uncover how the small RNA biogenesis pathway, composed by the nucleases Drosha and Dicer can act as direct antiviral factors, and how the type-I interferon response regulates the function of these. We will also describe how the factors involved in small RNA biogenesis and specific small RNAs impact the activation of the type I interferon response and antiviral activity. With this, we aim to expose the complex and intricate network of interactions between the different antiviral pathways in mammals."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs are an abundant class of small RNAs that are thought to regulate the expression of protein-coding genes in plants and animals. Here we show that the target sequence of two microRNAs, known to regulate genes in the class-III homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-Zip) gene family of the flowering plant Arabidopsis, is conserved in homologous sequences from all lineages of land plants, including bryophytes, lycopods, ferns and seed plants. We also find that the messenger RNAs from these genes are cleaved within the same microRNA-binding site in representatives of each land-plant group, as they are in Arabidopsis. Our results indicate not only that microRNAs mediate gene regulation in non-flowering as well as flowering plants, but also that the regulation of this class of plant genes dates back more than 400 million years."

        "abstract": "MicroRNA (miRNAs), a class of small, endogenous non-coding RNA molecules of about 21-24 nucleotides in length, have unraveled a new modulatory network of RNAs that form an additional level of posttranscriptional gene regulation by targeting messenger RNAs (mRNAs). These miRNAs possess the ability to regulate gene expression by modulating the stability of mRNAs, controlling their translation rates, and consequently regulating protein synthesis. Substantial experimental evidence established the involvement of miRNAs in most biological processes like growth, differentiation, development, and metabolism in mammals including humans. An aberrant expression of miRNAs has been implicated in several pathologies, including cancer. The association of miRNAs with tumor growth, development, and metastasis depicts their potential as effective diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. Furthermore, exploitation of the role of different miRNAs as oncogenes or tumor suppressors has aided in designing several miRNA-based therapeutic approaches for treating cancer patients whose clinical trials are underway. In this review, we aim to summarize the biogenesis of miRNAs and the dysregulations in these pathways that result in various pathologies and in some cases, resistance to drug treatment. We provide a detailed review of the miRNA expression signatures in different cancers along with their diagnostic and prognostic utility. Furthermore, we elaborate on the potential employment of miRNAs to enhance cancer cell apoptosis, regress tumor progression and even overcome miRNA-induced drug resistance."

        "abstract": "Increasingly complex networks of small RNAs act through RNA-interference (RNAi) pathways to regulate gene expression, to mediate antiviral responses, to organize chromosomal domains, and to restrain the spread of selfish genetic elements. Historically, RNAi has been defined as a response to double-stranded RNA. However, some small RNA species may not arise from double-stranded RNA precursors. Yet, like microRNAs and small interfering RNAs, such species guide Argonaute proteins to silencing targets through complementary base-pairing. Silencing can be achieved by corecruitment of accessory factors or through the activity of Argonaute itself, which often has endonucleolytic activity. As a specific and adaptive regulatory system, RNAi is used throughout eukarya, which indicates a long evolutionary history. A likely function of RNAi throughout that history is to protect the genome from both pathogenic and parasitic invaders."

We have characterized mutations in the Drosophila dicer-1 and dicer-2 genes. Mutation in dicer-1 blocks processing of miRNA precursors, whereas dicer-2 mutants are defective for processing siRNA precursors. It has been recently found that Drosophila Dicer-1 and Dicer-2 are also components of siRNA-dependent RISC (siRISC). We find that Dicer-1 and Dicer-2 are required for siRNA-directed mRNA cleavage, though the RNase III activity of Dicer-2 is not required. Dicer-1 and Dicer-2 facilitate distinct steps in the assembly of siRISC. However, Dicer-1 but not Dicer-2 is essential for miRISC-directed translation repression. Thus, siRISCs and miRISCs are different with respect to Dicers in Drosophila."

        "abstract": "We use native gel electrophoresis to characterize complexes that mediate RNA interference (RNAi) in Drosophila. Our data reveal three distinct complexes (R1, R2, and R3) that assemble on short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in vitro. To form, all three complexes require Dicer-2 (Dcr-2), which directly contacts siRNAs in the ATP-independent R1 complex. R1 serves as a precursor to both the R2 and R3 complexes. R3 is a large (80S), ATP-enhanced complex that contains unwound siRNAs, cofractionates with known RNAi factors, and binds and cleaves targeted mRNAs in a cognate-siRNA-dependent manner. Our results establish an ordered biochemical pathway for RISC assembly and indicate that siRNAs must first interact with Dcr-2 to reach the R3 \"holo-RISC\" complex. Dcr-2 does not simply transfer siRNAs to a distinct effector complex, but rather assembles into RISC along with the siRNAs, indicating that its role extends beyond the initiation phase of RNAi."

        "abstract": "Encoded in the genome of most eukaryotes, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been proposed to regulate specifically up to 90% of human genes through a process known as miRNA-guided RNA silencing. The aim of this review is to present this process as the integration of a succession of specialized molecular machines exerting well defined functions. The nuclear microprocessor complex initially recognizes and processes its primary miRNA substrate into a miRNA precursor (pre-miRNA). This structure is then exported to the cytoplasm by the Exportin-5 complex where it is presented to the pre-miRNA processing complex. Following pre-miRNA conversion into a miRNA:miRNA* duplex, this complex is assembled into a miRNA-containing ribonucleoprotein (miRNP) complex, after which the miRNA strand is selected. The degree of complementarity of the miRNA for its messenger RNA (mRNA) target guides the recruitment of the miRNP complex. Initially repressing its translation, the miRNP-silenced mRNA is directed to the P-bodies, where the mRNA is either released from its inhibition upon a cellular signal and/or actively degraded. The potency and specificity of miRNA biogenesis and function rely on the distinct protein x protein, protein x RNA and RNA:RNA interactions found in different complexes, each of which fulfill a specific function in a well orchestrated process."

Stem cells possess the ability to divide throughout their life and to produce differentiated daughter cells while maintaining a population of undifferentiated cells that remain in the stem cell niche and that retain stem cell identity. Many cancers also have small populations of cells with stem cell characteristics. These cells have been called cancer stem cells and are a likely cause of relapse in cancer patients. Understanding the biology of stem cells and cancer stem cells offers great promise in the fields of regenerative medicine and cancer treatment. microRNAs (miRNAs) are emerging as important regulators of post-transcriptional gene expression and are considered crucial for proper stem cell maintenance and function. miRNAs have also been strongly implicated in the development and pathology of cancer. In this review, we discuss the characteristics of various stem cell types, including cancer stem cells, and the importance of miRNAs therein."

We used computational methods to predict miRNAs conserved among Drosophila species and large-scale sequencing of small RNAs from Drosophila melanogaster to experimentally confirm and complement these predictions. In addition to validating 20 of our top 45 predictions for novel miRNA loci, the large-scale sequencing identified many miRNAs that had not been predicted. In total, 59 novel genes were identified, increasing our tally of confirmed fly miRNAs to 148. The large-scale sequencing also refined the identities of previously known miRNAs and provided insights into their biogenesis and expression. Many miRNAs were expressed in particular developmental contexts, with a large cohort of miRNAs expressed primarily in imaginal discs. Conserved miRNAs typically were expressed more broadly and robustly than were nonconserved miRNAs, and those conserved miRNAs with more restricted expression tended to have fewer predicted targets than those expressed more broadly. Predicted targets for the expanded set of microRNAs substantially increased and revised the miRNA-target relationships that appear conserved among the fly species. Insights were also provided into miRNA gene evolution, including evidence for emergent regulatory function deriving from the opposite arm of the miRNA hairpin, exemplified by mir-10, and even the opposite strand of the DNA, exemplified by mir-iab-4."

They are one of the most abundant classes of regulators, targeting a large fraction of all genes, making their comprehensive study a requirement for understanding regulation and development. Here we use 12 Drosophila genomes to define structural and evolutionary signatures of miRNA hairpins, which we use for their de novo discovery. We predict >41 novel miRNA genes, which encompass many unique families, and 28 of which are validated experimentally. We also define signals for the precise start position of mature miRNAs, which suggest corrections of previously known miRNAs, often leading to drastic changes in their predicted target spectrum. We show that miRNA discovery power scales with the number and divergence of species compared, suggesting that such approaches can be successful in human as dozens of mammalian genomes become available. Interestingly, for some miRNAs sense and anti-sense hairpins score highly and mature miRNAs from both strands can indeed be found in vivo. Similarly, miRNAs with weak 5' end predictions show increased in vivo processing of multiple alternate 5' ends and have fewer predicted targets. Lastly, we show that several miRNA star sequences score highly and are likely functional. For mir-10 in particular, both arms show abundant processing, and both show highly conserved target sites in Hox genes, suggesting a possible cooperation of the two arms, and their role as a master Hox regulator."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a novel class of small noncoding RNA molecules that regulate gene expression by inducing degradation or translational inhibition of target mRNAs. There are more than 500 miRNA genes reported in the human genome, constituting one of the largest classes of regulatory genes. Increasing experimental evidence supports the idea of aberrant miRNA expression in cancer pathogenesis. We analyzed the pattern of miRNA expression in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells and our results showed a global reduction in miRNA expression levels in CLL cells associated to a consistent underexpression of miR-181a, let-7a and miR-30d. We observed overexpression of miR-155 and a set of five miRNAs that are differentially expressed between patients with different clinical outcomes. Five novel miRNA candidates cloned from leukemic cells are reported. Surprisingly, predicted mRNA targets for these novel miRNA revealed a high proportion of targets located in a small region of chromosome 1, which is frequently altered in human cancer. Additionally, several targets were shared by at least two of miRNA candidates. Predicted targets included several genes recently described as tumor suppressors. These data could afford new avenues for exploring innovative pathways in CLL biology and therapy."

The current release (10.0) contains 5071 miRNA loci from 58 species, expressing 5922 distinct mature miRNA sequences: a growth of over 2000 sequences in the past 2 years. miRBase provides a range of data to facilitate studies of miRNA genomics: all miRNAs are mapped to their genomic coordinates. Clusters of miRNA sequences in the genome are highlighted, and can be defined and retrieved with any inter-miRNA distance. The overlap of miRNA sequences with annotated transcripts, both protein- and non-coding, are described. Finally, graphical views of the locations of a wide range of genomic features in model organisms allow for the first time the prediction of the likely boundaries of many miRNA primary transcripts. miRBase is available at http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk/."

        "abstract": "Mesenchymal stem cells, or multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC), isolated from various adult tissue sources have the capacities to self-renew and to differentiate into multiple lineages. Both of these processes are tightly regulated by genetic and epigenetic mechanisms. Emerging evidence indicates that the class of single-stranded noncoding RNAs known as microRNAs also plays a critical role in this process. First described in nematodes and plants, microRNAs have been shown to modulate major regulatory mechanisms in eukaryotic cells involved in a broad array of cellular functions. Studies with various types of embryonic as well as adult stem cells indicate an intricate network of microRNAs regulating key transcription factors and other genes, which in turn determine cell fate. In addition, expression of unique microRNAs in specific cell types serves as a useful diagnostic marker to define a particular cell type. MicroRNAs are also found to be regulated by extracellular signaling pathways that are important for differentiation into specific tissues, suggesting that they play a role in specifying tissue identity. In this review, we describe the importance of microRNAs in stem cells, focusing on our current understanding of microRNAs in MSC and their derivatives."

MicroRNAs exert their gene regulatory activity primarily by imperfectly base pairing to the 3' UTR of their target mRNAs, leading to mRNA degradation or translational inhibition. In cancer, microRNAs are often dysregulated with their expression patterns being correlated with clinically relevant tumor characteristics. Recently, microRNAs were shown to be directly involved in cancer initiation and progression. This review focuses primarily on emerging developments in the microRNA field that impact our understanding of how these molecules contribute to carcinogenesis."

        "title": "Controlling miRNA regulation in disease.",
        "abstract": "Our understanding of the importance of noncoding RNA molecules is steadily growing. One such important class of RNA molecules are microRNAs (miRNAs). These tiny RNAs fulfill important functions in cellular behavior by influencing the protein output levels of a high variety of genes through the regulation of target messenger RNAs. Moreover, miRNAs have been implicated in a wide range of diseases. In pathological conditions, the miRNA expression levels can be altered due to changes in the transcriptional or posttranscriptional regulation of miRNA expression. On the other side, mRNA molecules might be able to escape the regulation by miRNAs. In this review, we give an overview on how miRNA biogenesis can be altered in disease as well as how mRNAs can avoid the regulation by miRNAs. The interplay between these two processes defines the final protein output in a cell, and thus the normal or pathological cellular phenotype."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small (\u223c18-25 nucleotides), endogenous, noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression in a sequence-specific manner via the degradation of target mRNAs or the inhibition of protein translation. miRNAs are predicted to target up to one-third of all human mRNAs. Each miRNA can target hundreds of transcripts and proteins directly or indirectly, and more than one miRNA can converge on a single target transcript; thus, the potential regulatory circuitry afforded by miRNAs is enormous. Increasing evidence is revealing that the expression of miRNAs is deregulated in cancer. High-throughput miRNA quantification technologies provide powerful tools to study global miRNA profiles. It has become progressively more apparent that, although the number of miRNAs (\u223c1,000) is much smaller than the number of protein-coding genes (\u223c22,000), miRNA expression signatures more accurately reflect the developmental lineage and tissue origin of human cancers. Large-scale studies in human cancer have further demonstrated that miRNA expression signatures are associated not only with specific tumor subtypes but also with clinical outcomes."

Although much research has been devoted to let-7 target prediction and to understanding its biological role, research into what regulates let-7 has only just begun. Here, we review let-7-family conservation and the recent advances in understanding how let-7-expression is regulated at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels across species. A greater understanding of what controls let-7 expression might enable the development of treatments to fight or prevent many cancers."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have attracted considerable attention because of their important roles in development, normal physiology, and disease states including cancer. Recent studies have identified specific miRNAs that regulate the cell cycle and have documented that the loss or gain of miRNA-mediated cell-cycle control contributes to malignancy. miRNAs regulate classic cell-cycle control pathways by directly targeting proteins such as E2F transcription factors, cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks), cyclins and Cdk inhibitors. Moreover, from recent findings, it has been suggested that miRNAs themselves might be subject to cell-cycle dependent regulation. Together, these observations indicate that the reciprocal control of RNA silencing and the metazoan cell cycle impacts cellular behavior and disease."

        "title": "RNA silencing and HIV: a hypothesis for the etiology of the severe combined immunodeficiency induced by the virus.",
        "abstract": "A novel intrinsic HIV-1 antisense gene was previously described with RNA initiating from the region of an HIV-1 antisense initiator promoter element (HIVaINR). The antisense RNA is exactly complementary to HIV-1 sense RNA and capable of forming approximately 400 base-pair (bp) duplex RNA in the region of the long terminal repeat (LTR) spanning the beginning portion of TAR in the repeat (R) region and extending through the U3 region. Duplex or double-stranded RNA of several hundred nucleotides in length is a key initiating element of RNA interference (RNAi) in several species. This HIVaINR antisense RNA is also capable of forming multiple stem-loop or hairpin-like secondary structures by M-fold analysis, with at least one that perfectly fits the criteria for a microRNA (miRNA) precursor. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) interact in a sequence-specific manner with target messenger RNAs (mRNAs) to induce either cleavage of the message or impede translation. Human mRNA targets of the predicted HIVaINR antisense RNA (HAA) microRNAs include mRNA for the human interleukin-2 receptor gamma chain (IL-2RG), also called the common gamma (gammac) receptor chain, because it is an integral part of 6 receptors mediating interleukin signalling (IL-2R, IL-4R, IL-7R, IL-9R, IL-15R and IL-21R). Other potential human mRNA targets include interleukin-15 (IL-15) mRNA, the fragile x mental retardation protein (FMRP) mRNA, and the IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) mRNA, amongst others. Thus the proposed intrinsic HIVaINR antisense RNA microRNAs (HAAmiRNAs) of the human immunodeficiency virus form complementary targets with mRNAs of a key human gene in adaptive immunity, the IL-2Rgammac, in which genetic defects are known to cause an X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome (X-SCID), as well as mRNAs of genes important in innate immunity. A new model of intrinsic RNA silencing induced by the HIVaINR antisense RNA in the absence of Tat is proposed, with elements suggestive of both small interfering RNA (siRNA) and miRNA."

        "abstract": "microRNAs (miRNAs) play crucial roles in numerous developmental and metabolic processes in plants and animals. The steady-state levels of miRNAs need to be properly controlled to ensure normal development. Whereas the framework of miRNA biogenesis is established, factors involved in miRNA degradation remain unknown. Here, we show that a family of exoribonucleases encoded by the SMALL RNA DEGRADING NUCLEASE (SDN) genes degrades mature miRNAs in Arabidopsis. SDN1 acts specifically on single-stranded miRNAs in vitro and is sensitive to the 2'-O-methyl modification on the 3' terminal ribose of miRNAs. Simultaneous knockdown of three SDN genes in vivo results in elevated miRNA levels and pleiotropic developmental defects. Therefore, we have uncovered the enzymes that degrade miRNAs and demonstrated that miRNA turnover is crucial for plant development."

        "title": "Arabidopsis DRB4, AGO1, AGO7, and RDR6 participate in a DCL4-initiated antiviral RNA silencing pathway negatively regulated by DCL1.",
        "abstract": "Plant RNA silencing machinery enlists four primary classes of proteins to achieve sequence-specific regulation of gene expression and mount an antiviral defense. These include Dicer-like ribonucleases (DCLs), Argonaute proteins (AGOs), dsRNA-binding proteins (DRBs), and RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RDRs). Although at least four distinct endogenous RNA silencing pathways have been thoroughly characterized, a detailed understanding of the antiviral RNA silencing pathway is just emerging. In this report, we have examined the role of four DCLs, two AGOs, one DRB, and one RDR in controlling viral RNA accumulation in infected Arabidopsis plants by using a mutant virus lacking its silencing suppressor. Our results show that all four DCLs contribute to antiviral RNA silencing. We confirm previous reports implicating both DCL4 and DCL2 in this process and establish a minor role for DCL3. Surprisingly, we found that DCL1 represses antiviral RNA silencing through negatively regulating the expression of DCL4 and DCL3. We also implicate DRB4 in antiviral RNA silencing. Finally, we show that both AGO1 and AGO7 function to ensure efficient clearance of viral RNAs and establish that AGO1 is capable of targeting viral RNAs with more compact structures, whereas AGO7 and RDR6 favor less structured RNA targets. Our results resolve several key steps in the antiviral RNA silencing pathway and provide a basis for further in-depth analysis."

        "title": "Cleavage of the siRNA passenger strand during RISC assembly in human cells.",
        "abstract": "A crucial step in the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway involves the assembly of RISC, the RNA-induced silencing complex. RISC initially recognizes a double-stranded short interfering RNA (siRNA), but only one strand is finally retained in the functional ribonucleoprotein complex. The non-incorporated strand, or 'passenger' strand, is removed during the assembly process and most probably degraded thereafter. In this report, we show that the passenger strand is cleaved during the course of RISC assembly following the same rules established for the siRNA-guided cleavage of a target RNA. Chemical modifications impairing the cleavage of the passenger strand also impair the cleavage of a target RNA in vitro as well as the silencing of a reporter gene in vivo, suggesting that passenger strand removal is facilitated by its cleavage during RISC assembly. Interestingly, target RNA cleavage can be rescued if an otherwise non-cleavable passenger strand shows a nick at the scissile phosphodiester bond, which further indicates that the cleavage event per se is not essential."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) represent an abundant class of non-coding RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression, primarily at the post-transcriptional level. miRNA genes are frequently located in proximity to fragile chromosomal sites associated with cancers and amplification of a miRNA cluster has been correlated with the etiology of lymphomas and solid tumors. The oncogenic potential of a miRNA polycistron has recently been demonstrated in vivo. Here, we show that misexpression of the Drosophila miRNA mirvana/mir-278 in the developing eye causes massive overgrowth, in part due to inhibition of apoptosis. A single base substitution affecting the mature miRNA blocks the gain-of-function phenotype but is not associated with a detectable reduction-of-function phenotype when homozygous. This result demonstrates that misexpressed miRNAs may acquire novel functions that cause unscheduled proliferation in vivo and thus exemplifies the potential of miRNAs to promote tumor formation."

        "abstract": "Discovered just over a decade ago, microRNA (miRNA) is now recognized as one of the major regulatory gene families in eukaryotic cells. Hundreds of miRNAs have been found in animals, plants and viruses, and there are certainly more to come. Through specific base-pairing with mRNAs, these tiny approximately 22-nt RNAs induce mRNA degradation or translational repression, or both. Because a miRNA can target numerous mRNAs, often in combination with other miRNAs, miRNAs operate highly complex regulatory networks. In this article, we summarize the current status of miRNA gene mining and miRNA expression profiling. We also review up-to-date knowledge of miRNA gene structure and the biogenesis mechanism. Our focus is on animal miRNAs."

        "abstract": "microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in plants bear a methyl group on the ribose of the 3' terminal nucleotide. We showed previously that the methylation of miRNAs and siRNAs requires the protein HEN1 in vivo and that purified HEN1 protein methylates miRNA/miRNA* duplexes in vitro. In this study, we show that HEN1 methylates both miRNA/miRNA* and siRNA/siRNA* duplexes in vitro with a preference for 21-24 nt RNA duplexes with 2 nt overhangs. We also demonstrate that HEN1 deposits the methyl group on to the 2' OH of the 3' terminal nucleotide. Among various modifications that can occur on the ribose of the terminal nucleotide, such as 2'-deoxy, 3'-deoxy, 2'-O-methyl and 3'-O-methyl, only 2'-O-methyl on a small RNA inhibits the activity of yeast poly(A) polymerase (PAP). These findings indicate that HEN1 specifically methylates miRNAs and siRNAs and implicate the importance of the 2'-O-methyl group in the biology of RNA silencing."

        "title": "Dicer function is essential for lung epithelium morphogenesis.",
        "abstract": "DICER is a key enzyme that processes microRNA and small interfering RNA precursors into their short mature forms, enabling them to regulate gene expression. Only a single Dicer gene exists in the mouse genome, and it is broadly expressed in developing tissues. Dicer-null mutants die before gastrulation. Therefore, to study Dicer function in the later event of lung formation, we inactivated it in the mouse lung epithelium using a Dicer conditional allele and the Sonic Hedgehogcre (Shhcre) allele. Branching arrests in these mutant lungs, although epithelial growth continues in distal domains that are expanded compared with normal samples. These defects result in a few large epithelial pouches in the mutant lung instead of numerous fine branches present in a normal lung. Significantly, the initial phenotypes are apparent before an increase in epithelial cell death is observed, leading us to propose that Dicer plays a specific role in regulating lung epithelial morphogenesis independent of its requirement in cell survival. In addition, we found that the expression of Fgf10, a key gene involved in lung development, is up-regulated and expanded in the mesenchyme of Dicer mutant lungs. Previous studies support the hypothesis that precise localization of FGF10 in discrete sites of the lung mesenchyme serves as a chemoattractant for the outgrowth of epithelial branches. The aberrant Fgf10 expression may contribute to the Dicer morphological defects. However, the mechanism by which DICER functions in the epithelium to influence Fgf10 expression in the mesenchyme remains unknown."

To uncover the role of the liver-specific miR-122 in the adult liver, we inhibited it in mice with a 2'-O-methoxyethyl phosphorothioate ASO. miR-122 inhibition in normal mice resulted in reduced plasma cholesterol levels, increased hepatic fatty-acid oxidation, and a decrease in hepatic fatty-acid and cholesterol synthesis rates. Activation of the central metabolic sensor AMPK was also increased. miR-122 inhibition in a diet-induced obesity mouse model resulted in decreased plasma cholesterol levels and a significant improvement in liver steatosis, accompanied by reductions in several lipogenic genes. These results implicate miR-122 as a key regulator of cholesterol and fatty-acid metabolism in the adult liver and suggest that miR-122 may be an attractive therapeutic target for metabolic disease."

These small molecules have been shown to play a critical role in a wide range of developmental and physiological pathways. Although hundreds of different miRNAs have now been identified using cloning and computational approaches, characterization of their targets and biological roles has been more limited. New sequencing technologies promise to accelerate the sequencing of small RNAs and additional genetic and genomic strategies are being applied to assess their regulatory function on RNA targets. These technologies will enable the identification of large numbers of small RNAs from diverse species, and comparative genomics approaches based on these data are likely to identify additional miRNAs. Combined with bioinformatics and experimental approaches to separate miRNAs from short-interfering RNAs (siRNAs), the pace of miRNA discovery is likely to accelerate, leading to an improved understanding of miRNA function and biological significance."

From a large-scale miRnome analysis on 540 samples including lung, breast, stomach, prostate, colon, and pancreatic tumors, we identified a solid cancer miRNA signature composed by a large portion of overexpressed miRNAs. Among these miRNAs are some with well characterized cancer association, such as miR-17-5p, miR-20a, miR-21, miR-92, miR-106a, and miR-155. The predicted targets for the differentially expressed miRNAs are significantly enriched for protein-coding tumor suppressors and oncogenes (P < 0.0001). A number of the predicted targets, including the tumor suppressors RB1 (Retinoblastoma 1) and TGFBR2 (transforming growth factor, beta receptor II) genes were confirmed experimentally. Our results indicate that miRNAs are extensively involved in cancer pathogenesis of solid tumors and support their function as either dominant or recessive cancer genes."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are implicated in both tissue differentiation and maintenance of tissue identity. In most cases, however, the mechanisms underlying their regulation are not known. One brain-specific miRNA, miR-124a, decreases the levels of hundreds of nonneuronal transcripts, such that its introduction into HeLa cells promotes a neuronal-like mRNA profile. The transcriptional repressor, RE1 silencing transcription factor (REST), has a reciprocal activity, inhibiting the expression of neuronal genes in nonneuronal cells. Here, we show that REST regulates the expression of a family of miRNAs, including brain-specific miR-124a. In nonneuronal cells and neural progenitors, REST inhibits miR-124a expression, allowing the persistence of nonneuronal transcripts. As progenitors differentiate into mature neurons, REST leaves miR-124a gene loci, and nonneuronal transcripts are degraded selectively. Thus, the combined transcriptional and posttranscriptional consequences of REST action maximize the contrast between neuronal and nonneuronal cell phenotypes."

        "abstract": "During embryogenesis, multipotent progenitors within the single-layered surface epithelium differentiate to form the epidermis and its appendages. Here, we show that microRNAs (miRNAs) have an essential role in orchestrating these events. We cloned more than 100 miRNAs from skin and show that epidermis and hair follicles differentially express discrete miRNA families. To explore the functional significance of this finding, we conditionally targeted Dicer1 gene ablation in embryonic skin progenitors. Within the first week after loss of miRNA expression, cell fate specification and differentiation were not markedly impaired, and in the interfollicular epidermis, apoptosis was not markedly increased. Notably, however, developing hair germs evaginate rather than invaginate, thereby perturbing the epidermal organization. Here we characterize miRNAs in skin, the existence of which was hitherto unappreciated, and demonstrate their differential expression and importance in the morphogenesis of epithelial tissues within this vital organ."

        "abstract": "Eukaryotic heterochromatin is characterized by a high density of repeats and transposons, as well as by modified histones, and influences both gene expression and chromosome segregation. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, we deleted the argonaute, dicer, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene homologs, which encode part of the machinery responsible for RNA interference (RNAi). Deletion results in the aberrant accumulation of complementary transcripts from centromeric heterochromatic repeats. This is accompanied by transcriptional de-repression of transgenes integrated at the centromere, loss of histone H3 lysine-9 methylation, and impairment of centromere function. We propose that double-stranded RNA arising from centromeric repeats targets formation and maintenance of heterochromatin through RNAi."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) constitute a novel, phylogenetically extensive family of small RNAs ( approximately 22 nucleotides) with potential roles in gene regulation. Apart from the finding that miRNAs are produced by Dicer from the precursors of approximately 70 nucleotides (pre-miRNAs), little is known about miRNA biogenesis. Some miRNA genes have been found in close conjunction, suggesting that they are expressed as single transcriptional units. Here, we present in vivo and in vitro evidence that these clustered miRNAs are expressed polycistronically and are processed through at least two sequential steps: (i) generation of the approximately 70 nucleotide pre-miRNAs from the longer transcripts (termed pri-miRNAs); and (ii) processing of pre-miRNAs into mature miRNAs. Subcellular localization studies showed that the first and second steps are compartmentalized into the nucleus and cytoplasm, respectively, and that the pre-miRNA serves as the substrate for nuclear export. Our study suggests that the regulation of miRNA expression may occur at multiple levels, including the two processing steps and the nuclear export step. These data will provide a framework for further studies on miRNA biogenesis."

        "title": "Two classes of short interfering RNA in RNA silencing.",
        "abstract": "RNA silencing is a eukaryotic genome defence system that involves processing of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) into 21-26 nt, short interfering RNA (siRNA). The siRNA mediates suppression of genes corresponding to the dsRNA through targeted RNA degradation. In some plant systems there are additional silencing processes, involving systemic spread of silencing and RNA-directed methylation/transcriptional suppression of homologous genomic DNA. We show here that siRNAs produced in plants from a green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgene are in short (21-22 nt) and long (24-26 nt) size classes, whereas those from endogenous retroelements are only in the long class. Viral suppressors of RNA silencing and mutations in Arabidopsis indicate that these classes of siRNA have different roles. The long siRNA is dispensable for sequence-specific mRNA degradation, but correlates with systemic silencing and methylation of homologous DNA. Conversely, the short siRNA class correlates with mRNA degradation but not with systemic signalling or methylation. These findings reveal an unexpected level of complexity in the RNA silencing pathway in plants that may also apply in animals."

        "abstract": "We predict regulatory targets for 14 Arabidopsis microRNAs (miRNAs) by identifying mRNAs with near complementarity. Complementary sites within predicted targets are conserved in rice. Of the 49 predicted targets, 34 are members of transcription factor gene families involved in developmental patterning or cell differentiation. The near-perfect complementarity between plant miRNAs and their targets suggests that many plant miRNAs act similarly to small interfering RNAs and direct mRNA cleavage. The targeting of developmental transcription factors suggests that many plant miRNAs function during cellular differentiation to clear key regulatory transcripts from daughter cell lineages."

        "abstract": "The 'classic' view of molecular oncology indicates that cancer is a genetic disease involving tumor suppressor and oncogenic proteins. However, in the recent years, it has been demonstrated that small regulatory non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) named microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in human tumorigenesis, thus revealing a new layer in the molecular architecture of human cancer. Gene expression studies revealed that hundreds of miRNAs are deregulated in cancer cells and functional studies clarified that miRNAs are involved in all the molecular and biological processes that drive tumorigenesis. Here, we summarize the recent advances in miRNA involvement in human cancer and illustrate the benefits of using these knowledge for medical practice. New diagnostic classifiers based on miRNAs will soon be available for medical practitioners and, even more importantly, miRNAs may become novel anti-cancer tools."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are 20-24 nt long endogenous non-coding RNAs that act as post-transcriptional regulators in metazoa and plants. Plant miRNA targets typically contain a single sequence motif with near-perfect complementarity to the miRNA. Here, we extended and applied the program RNAhybrid to identify novel miRNA targets in the complete annotated Arabidopsis thaliana transcriptome. RNAhybrid predicts the energetically most favorable miRNA:mRNA hybrids that are consistent with user-defined structural constraints. These were: (i) perfect base pairing of the duplex from nucleotide 8 to 12 counting from the 5'-end of the miRNA; (ii) loops with a maximum length of one nucleotide in either strand; (iii) bulges with no more than one nucleotide in size; and (iv) unpaired end overhangs not longer than two nucleotides. G:U base pairs are not treated as mismatches, but contribute less favorable to the overall free energy. The resulting hybrids were filtered according to their minimum free energy, resulting in an overall prediction of more than 600 novel miRNA targets. The specificity and signal-to-noise ratio of the prediction was assessed with either randomized miRNAs or randomized target sequences as negative controls. Our results are in line with recent observations that the majority of miRNA targets are not transcription factors."

        "abstract": "Cancer is currently a major public health problem and, as such, emerging research is making significant progress in identifying major players in its biology. One recent topic of interest involves microRNAs (miRNAs) which are small, non-coding RNA molecules that inhibit gene expression post-transcriptionally. They accomplish this by binding to the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of target messengerRNA (mRNA), resulting in either their degradation or inhibition of translation, depending on the degree of complementary base pairing. They are transcribed by RNA polymerase II and are formed into mature miRNAs via two steps, each catalyzed by a different ribonuclease III (RNaseIII). Cross-species comparisons demonstrate that miRNAs are evolutionarily conserved and play important roles in a wide array of normal biological processes. Importantly, aberrant miRNA expression is correlated with human disease, especially in the development of cancer. Recent research has identified targets and functions of miRNAs, illustrating that some are oncogenic in nature while others show tumor suppressor activity. The miRNAs have also been characterized as having high potential in the clinical arena and, as such, have been a target for exploitation toward cancer therapy. Not only has it been shown that miRNA expression profiles may prove useful as diagnostic and prognostic markers in cancer, various miRNA-based therapies show promise as well. It is anticipated that further research will elucidate the benefits of using miRNAs as clinical agents in the battle against cancer and other chronic diseases."

Furthermore, the expression of some miRNAs is readily altered in cells after an acute or chronic exposure to medications, toxins or carcinogens. Therefore, dysregulation of specific miRNAs by a xenobiotic agent, which control the expression of DMEs or DTs, might lead to considerable change in the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic property of a concomitant drug or the agent itself. Improved understanding of the regulatory pathways of DMEs and DTs shall provide novel insight into multi-drug resistance and potential drug-drug interaction in clinical pharmacotherapy as well as in drug discovery and development."

        "title": "The complexities of microRNA regulation: mirandering around the rules.",
        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an important class of non-coding small RNAs that possess a large range of biological activities in a variety of organisms and are linked to human diseases such as cancer. Initially, miRNAs were thought to act solely as negative regulators of gene expression and exert their effects by binding to regions within the 3'UTR of their target protein-coding messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in a sequence dependent manner. However, recent data reveals that miRNA regulation entails a far more complex system of post-transcriptional control than initially appreciated. An evolving consensus has emerged of how miRNAs can repress as well as activate gene expression by interacting with complementary regions found in the promoter, coding region, as well as the 3'UTR of their mRNA targets. Furthermore, miRNAs are extensively regulated at the levels of miRNA promoter transcription, methylation, miRNA processing, RNA editing, and miRNA-target interactions. This review will discuss new insights into miRNA-based mechanisms and the role specific DNA- and RNA-binding factors play in fine-tuning gene expression in both negative and positive ways by directing miRNA biogenesis and activity. We will also discuss the influence that cellular context and environmental cues have on miRNA function. In the future, a clear understanding of miRNA regulation will be essential when understanding the role miRNAs play during animal development and in maintaining adult homeostasis as well as exploring the use of small RNAs for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an important class of endogenous small silencing RNAs in both plants and animals. They regulate the expression of a wide range of target genes that are involved in many important biological processes. Biogenesis of plant miRNAs requires a distinct set of proteins, including members that belong to several highly conserved RNA silencing protein families. The framework for miRNA biogenesis in plants was revealed through genetic and biochemical analyses using mutants that are defective in miRNA accumulation. These general miRNA-deficient mutants constitute a set of invaluable genetic resources for the plant miRNA research community. They could be utilized to experimentally validate the candidate miRNAs that are either predicted by a computational program or recovered from a small RNA deep sequencing effort which is becoming a more affordable and widely used approach for small RNA discovery. Starting with a brief introduction on multiple small RNA pathways in plants, this chapter provides basic experimental procedures for the examination of miRNA accumulation from wild type plants and various mutant lines in Arabidopsis."

        "abstract": "Small non-protein-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) have acquired diverse functions in plant and animals development. These riboregulators have been confirmed to cooperate in plant growth and development in the processes of moderating the levels of specific mRNAs and their translation products through to chromatin remodeling and silencing. According to the specific needs for interpreting and annotating small-RNA-based regulatory networks, it is evident that many additional components remain to be discovered and functionally characterized. Shedding light on the remaining components and uncovering the relation of the small-RNA-generating pathways with the synthesis of other components such as hormones and transcription factors define future challenges as more complicated mechanisms are expected to be characterized. In this review, we summarize our current understanding of the molecular and biological roles of ncRNAs in gene regulation/expression, describe in detail the specific and shared components for each pathway and highlight the advances in currently identified relationships and interactions between small ncRNAs. We present a fully integrated pathway connecting ncRNA entities such as miRNAs, siRNAs, ta-siRNAs, and nat-siRNAs, to each other within Arabidopsis thaliana."

Some miRs exert negative control over the expression of numerous oncoproteins in normal cells and consequently their deregulation is believed to be an important mechanism underlying cancer development and progression. Owing to their distinct patterns of expression associated with cancer type, remarkable stability and presence in blood and other body fluids, miRs are considered to be highly promising cancer biomarkers. The identification of \"miR signatures\" associating cancer cell phenotypes with disease outcome and specific risk factor exposures will undoubtedly open new avenues for early diagnosis and therapy of cancer, as well as for the development of novel strategies for cancer prevention."

        "title": "From genetic to genomic regulation: iterativity in microRNA research.",
        "abstract": "The discovery and ongoing investigation of microRNAs (miRNAs) suggest important conceptual and methodological lessons for philosophers and historians of biology. This paper provides an account of miRNA research and the shift from viewing these tiny regulatory entities as minor curiosities to seeing them as major players in the post-transcriptional regulation of genes. Conceptually, the study of miRNAs is part of a broader change in understandings of genetic regulation, in which simple switch-like mechanisms were reinterpreted as aspects of complex cellular and genome-wide processes. Among them are the activities of small RNAs, previously regarded as non-functional. Methodologically, the miRNA story suggests new ways of characterizing biological research that should prove helpful to philosophers of science who seek to develop more pluralistic, pragmatic models of scientific inquiry. miRNA research displays iterative movements between multiple modes of investigation that include not only the proposal and testing of hypotheses but also exploratory, technology-oriented and question-driven modes of research. As an exemplary story of scientific discovery and development, the miRNA case illustrates transitions from genetics to genomics and systems biology, and it shows how diverse configurations of research practice are related to major scientific advances."

To perform their myriad roles, not only must precise small RNA species be generated, but they must also be loaded into specific effector complexes called RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISCs).

In this Review, we explore the mechanisms that pair specific small RNA strands with their partner proteins, with an eye towards the substantial progress that has been recently made in understanding the sorting of the major small RNA classes - microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) - in plants and animals."

        "abstract": "Mature microRNAs (miRNAs) are single-stranded RNA molecules of 20-23 nucleotide (nt) length that control gene expression in many cellular processes. These molecules typically reduce the stability of mRNAs, including those of genes that mediate processes in tumorigenesis, such as inflammation, cell cycle regulation, stress response, differentiation, apoptosis and invasion. miRNA targeting is mostly achieved through specific base-pairing interactions between the 5' end ('seed' region) of the miRNA and sites within coding and untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNAs; target sites in the 3' UTR lead to more effective mRNA destabilization. Since miRNAs frequently target hundreds of mRNAs, miRNA regulatory pathways are complex. To provide a critical overview of miRNA dysregulation in cancer, we first discuss the methods currently available for studying the role of miRNAs in cancer and then review miRNA genomic organization, biogenesis and mechanism of target recognition, examining how these processes are altered in tumorigenesis. Given the critical role miRNAs play in tumorigenesis processes and their disease-specific expression, they hold potential as therapeutic targets and novel biomarkers."

MiRNAs are endogenous single-stranded non-coding RNAs (~22-nt long) that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Through pairing with mRNA, miRNAs can down-regulate gene expression by inhibiting translation or stimulating mRNA degradation. In some cases they can also up-regulate the expression of a target gene. MiRNAs influence a variety of cellular pathways that range from development to carcinogenesis. The involvement of miRNAs in several human diseases, particularly cancer, makes them potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. Recent technological advances, especially high-throughput sequencing, have led to an exponential growth in the generation of miRNA-related data. A number of bioinformatic tools and databases have been devised to manage this growing body of data. We analyze 129 miRNA tools that are being used in diverse areas of miRNA research, to assist investigators in choosing the most appropriate tools for their needs."

        "abstract": "The discovery of microRNAs (miRNAs) is one of the major scientific breakthroughs in recent years and has revolutionized the way we look at gene regulation. Although we are still at a very early stage in understanding their impact on immunity, miRNAs are changing the way we think about the development of the immune system and regulation of immune functions. MiRNAs are implicated in establishing and maintaining the cell fate of immune cells (e.g. miR-181a and miR-223), and they are involved in innate immunity by regulating Toll-like receptor signaling and ensuing cytokine response (e.g. miR-146). Moreover, miRNAs regulate central elements of the adaptive immune response such as antigen presentation (e.g. miR-155) and T cell receptor signaling (miR-181a). Recent evidence showing altered miRNA expression in chronic inflammatory diseases (e.g. miR-203 and miR-146) suggests their involvement in immune-mediated diseases. Furthermore, miRNAs have been implicated in viral immune escape and anti-viral defense (e.g. miR-196). In this review, we will summarize the latest findings about the role of miRNAs in the development of the immune system and regulation of immune functions and inflammation."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs are a growing class of endogenous small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression by binding to target messenger RNAs and inducing translational repression, cleavage or destabilization of the target. Because each miRNA potentially can regulate expression of a distinct set of genes, it is conceivable that the differential expression of different miRNAs might profoundly influence the repertoire of genes that are expressed during development, differentiation or disease. Here, we provide background on the biogenesis and function of miRNAs, and discuss how miRNA-mediated regulation can influence tumorigenesis as well as normal development and function of cells of the immune system."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play critical roles in development, and dysregulation of miRNA expression has been observed in human malignancies. Recent evidence suggests that the processing of several primary miRNA transcripts (pri-miRNAs) is blocked posttranscriptionally in embryonic stem cells, embryonal carcinoma cells, and primary tumors. Here we show that Lin28, a developmentally regulated RNA binding protein, selectively blocks the processing of pri-let-7 miRNAs in embryonic cells. Using in vitro and in vivo studies, we found that Lin28 is necessary and sufficient for blocking Microprocessor-mediated cleavage of pri-let-7 miRNAs. Our results identify Lin28 as a negative regulator of miRNA biogenesis and suggest that Lin28 may play a central role in blocking miRNA-mediated differentiation in stem cells and in certain cancers."

        "abstract": "Cancer progression is mediated by overexpression of oncogenes and downregulation or loss of tumor suppressors. Proteins, which were traditionally categorized into these groups, have been recently joined by a species of RNA molecules known as microRNAs (miRNAs). miRNAs belong to a class of approximately 22-nt-long non-coding RNAs found in eukaryotes that hinder gene expression by inducing degradation or inhibiting translation of select mRNAs. A growing number of miRNAs have been implicated in promoting or suppressing tumorigenesis in a variety of tissues. The supporting evidence ranges from suggestive expression profiling data to direct functional validation using methods of forward and reverse genetics. We discuss the nature of published results, as well as the merits and pitfalls of various approaches aimed at identification of cancer-related miRNAs and their mRNA targets."

There are currently hundreds of confirmed miRNAs in humans, and computational predictions suggest that the total count might be more than thousand.

To illustrate the importance of miRNA-mediated regulation in solid cancer some confirmed interactions were collected. Their relevance is described in detail in melanomas from the aspect of diagnosis, the potential application of miRNAs as biomarkers and as potential therapeutic tools."

        "abstract": "Mammalian microRNAs are emerging as key regulators of the development and function of the immune system. Here, we report a strong but transient induction of miR-155 in mouse bone marrow after injection of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) correlated with granulocyte/monocyte (GM) expansion. Demonstrating the sufficiency of miR-155 to drive GM expansion, enforced expression in mouse bone marrow cells caused GM proliferation in a manner reminiscent of LPS treatment. However, the miR-155-induced GM populations displayed pathological features characteristic of myeloid neoplasia. Of possible relevance to human disease, miR-155 was found to be overexpressed in the bone marrow of patients with certain subtypes of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Furthermore, miR-155 repressed a subset of genes implicated in hematopoietic development and disease. These data implicate miR-155 as a contributor to physiological GM expansion during inflammation and to certain pathological features associated with AML, emphasizing the importance of proper miR-155 regulation in developing myeloid cells during times of inflammatory stress."

        "title": "MicroRNomics: a newly emerging approach for disease biology.",
        "abstract": "Genomic evidence reveals that gene expression in humans is precisely controlled in cellular, tissue-type, temporal, and condition-specific manners. Completely understanding the regulatory mechanisms of gene expression is therefore one of the most important issues in genomic medicine. Surprisingly, recent analyses of the human and animal genomes have demonstrated that the majority of RNA transcripts are relatively small, noncoding RNAs (sncRNAs), rather than large, protein coding message RNAs (mRNAs). Moreover, these sncRNAs may represent a novel important layer of regulation for gene expression. The most important breakthrough in this new area is the discovery of microRNAs (miRNAs). miRNAs comprise a novel class of endogenous, small, noncoding RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression via degradation or translational inhibition of their target mRNAs. As a group, miRNAs may directly regulate approximately 30% of the genes in the human genome. In keeping with the nomenclature of RNomics, which is to study sncRNAs on the genomic scale, \"microRNomics\" is coined here to describe a novel subdiscipline of genomics that studies the identification, expression, biogenesis, structure, regulation of expression, targets, and biological functions of miRNAs on the genomic scale. A growing body of exciting evidence suggests that miRNAs are important regulators of cell differentiation, proliferation/growth, mobility, and apoptosis. These miRNAs therefore play important roles in development and physiology. Consequently, dysregulation of miRNA function may lead to human diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, liver disease, immune dysfunction, and metabolic disorders. microRNomics may be a newly emerging approach for human disease biology."

        "abstract": "Argonaute proteins were first discovered genetically, and extensive research in the past few years has revealed that members of the Argonaute protein family are key players in gene-silencing pathways guided by small RNAs. Small RNAs such as short interfering RNAs (siRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs) or Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are anchored into specific binding pockets and guide Argonaute proteins to target mRNA molecules for silencing or destruction. Various classes of small RNAs and Argonaute proteins are found in all higher eukaryotes and have important functions in processes as diverse as embryonic development, cell differentiation and transposon silencing. Argonaute proteins are evolutionarily conserved and can be phylogenetically subdivided into the Ago subfamily and the Piwi subfamily. Ago proteins are ubiquitously expressed and bind to siRNAs or miRNAs to guide post-transcriptional gene silencing either by destabilization of the mRNA or by translational repression. The expression of Piwi proteins is mostly restricted to the germ line and Piwi proteins associate with piRNAs to facilitate silencing of mobile genetic elements. Although various aspects of Argonaute function have been identified, many Argonaute proteins are still poorly characterized. Therefore, it is very likely that as yet unknown functions of the Argonaute protein family will be elucidated in the future."

In particular, the let-7 miRNA family has been proposed to function in tumor suppression, because reduced expression of let-7 family members is common in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Here, we show that let-7 functionally inhibits non-small cell tumor development. Ectopic expression of let-7g in K-Ras(G12D)-expressing murine lung cancer cells induced both cell cycle arrest and cell death. In tumor xenografts, we observed significant growth reduction of both murine and human non-small cell lung tumors when overexpression of let-7g was induced from lentiviral vectors. In let-7g expressing tumors, reductions in Ras family and HMGA2 protein levels were detected. Importantly, let-7g-mediated tumor suppression was more potent in lung cancer cell lines harboring oncogenic K-Ras mutations than in lines with other mutations. Ectopic expression of K-Ras(G12D) largely rescued let-7g mediated tumor suppression, whereas ectopic expression of HMGA2 was less effective. Finally, in an autochthonous model of NSCLC in the mouse, let-7g expression substantially reduced lung tumor burden."

        "abstract": "Dicer initiates RNA interference by generating small RNAs involved in various silencing pathways. Dicer participates in centromeric silencing, but its role in the epigenetic regulation of other chromatin domains has not been explored. Here we show that Dicer1 deficiency in Mus musculus leads to decreased DNA methylation, concomitant with increased telomere recombination and telomere elongation. These DNA-methylation defects correlate with decreased expression of Dnmt1, Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b DNA methyltransferases (Dnmts), and methylation levels can be recovered by their overexpression. We identify the retinoblastoma-like 2 protein (Rbl2) as responsible for decreased Dnmt expression in Dicer1-null cells, suggesting the existence of Dicer-dependent small RNAs that target Rbl2. We identify the miR-290 cluster as being downregulated in Dicer1-deficient cells and show that it silences Rbl2, thereby controlling Dnmt expression. These results identify a pathway by which miR-290 directly regulates Rbl2-dependent Dnmt expression, indirectly affecting telomere-length homeostasis."

        "abstract": "Loss of microRNA (miRNA) pathway components negatively affects differentiation of embryonic stem (ES) cells, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly defined. Here we characterize changes in mouse ES cells lacking Dicer (Dicer1). Transcriptome analysis of Dicer-/- cells indicates that the ES-specific miR-290 cluster has an important regulatory function in undifferentiated ES cells. Consistently, many of the defects in Dicer-deficient cells can be reversed by transfection with miR-290 family miRNAs. We demonstrate that Oct4 (also known as Pou5f1) silencing in differentiating Dicer-/- ES cells is accompanied by accumulation of repressive histone marks but not by DNA methylation, which prevents the stable repression of Oct4. The methylation defect correlates with downregulation of de novo DNA methyltransferases (Dnmts). The downregulation is mediated by Rbl2 and possibly other transcriptional repressors, potential direct targets of miR-290 cluster miRNAs. The defective DNA methylation can be rescued by ectopic expression of de novo Dnmts or by transfection of the miR-290 cluster miRNAs, indicating that de novo DNA methylation in ES cells is controlled by miRNAs."

In this review, we first describe the discovery and pathways of transitivity with emphasis on RNA-dependent RNA polymerases followed by description on the short range and systemic spread of silencing. We also provide an in-depth view on the various size classes of secondary siRNAs and their different roles in RNA silencing including their categorization based on their biogenesis. The other regulatory roles of secondary siRNAs in transgene silencing, virus-induced gene silencing, transitivity, and -species transfer have also been detailed. The possible implications and applications of systemic silencing and the different gene silencing tools developed are also described. The details on mobility and roles of secondary siRNAs derived from viral genome in plant defense against the respective viruses are presented. This entails the description of other compatible plant-virus interactions and the corresponding small RNAs that determine recovery from disease symptoms, exclusion of viruses from shoot meristems, and natural resistance.

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short, regulatory RNAs that act as post-transcriptional repressors of gene expression in diverse biological contexts. The emergence of small RNA-mediated gene silencing preceded the onset of multicellularity and was followed by a drastic expansion of the miRNA repertoire in conjunction with the evolution of complexity in the plant and animal kingdoms. Along this process, miRNAs became an essential feature of animal development, as no higher metazoan lineage tolerated loss of miRNAs or their associated protein machinery. In fact, ablation of the miRNA biogenesis machinery or the effector silencing factors results in severe embryogenesis defects in every animal studied. In this review, we summarize recent mechanistic insight into miRNA biogenesis and function, while emphasizing features that have enabled multicellular organisms to harness the potential of this broad class of repressors. We first discuss how different mechanisms of regulation of miRNA biogenesis are used, not only to generate spatio-temporal specificity of miRNA production within an animal, but also to achieve the necessary levels and dynamics of expression. We then explore how evolution of the mechanism for small RNA-mediated repression resulted in a diversity of silencing complexes that cause different molecular effects on their targets. Multicellular organisms have taken advantage of this variability in the outcome of miRNA-mediated repression, with differential use in particular cell types or even distinct subcellular compartments. Finally, we present an overview of how the animal miRNA repertoire has evolved and diversified, emphasizing the emergence of miRNA families and the biological implications of miRNA sequence diversification. Overall, focusing on selected animal models and through the lens of evolution, we highlight canonical mechanisms in miRNA biology and their variations, providing updated insight that will ultimately help us understand the contribution of miRNAs to the development and physiology of multicellular organisms."

Their expression is specific to cells and tissues and is temporally regulated. miRNAs are known to be involved in developmental and physiological processes, and their dysregulation leads to development of diseases. Since their profiles reflect pathological processes, miRNAs have recently been proposed as being useful in diagnostics as biomarkers of the onset, prognosis and risk of diseases, as well as in the classification of different types of cancer. The establishment of miRNA profiles that are representative of diseases and the detection of different types and levels of miRNA in samples are therefore critical milestones in diagnostics. miRNAs can be detected in blood and body fluids as well as in tissues, thus making non-invasive collection of samples possible. For a method to be useful in diagnostics, it should be simple, inexpensive and highly sensitive. Here, we will review current methods of detecting miRNAs and indicate the advantages and disadvantages of each techniques. We will then summarize some of the clinical evidence for the potential application of miRNAs as biomarkers in diagnostics. We conclude providing some general perspectives on the use of miRNAs in clinical situations, including therapeutic applications."

        "abstract": "A well-defined mechanism governs the maturation of most microRNAs (miRNAs) in animals, via stepwise cleavage of precursor hairpin transcripts by the Drosha and Dicer RNase III enzymes. Recently, several alternative miRNA biogenesis pathways were elucidated, the most prominent of which substitutes Drosha cleavage with splicing. Such short hairpin introns are known as mirtrons, and their study has uncovered related pathways that combine splicing with other ribonucleolytic machinery to yield Dicer substrates for miRNA biogenesis. In this review, we consider the mechanisms of splicing-mediated miRNA biogenesis, computational strategies for mirtron discovery, and the evolutionary implications of the existence of multiple miRNA biogenesis pathways. Altogether, the features of mirtron pathways illustrate unexpected flexibility in combining RNA processing pathways, and highlight how multiple functions can be encoded by individual transcripts."

        "abstract": "In plants, the known microRNAs (miRNAs) are produced as approximately 21 nucleotide (nt) duplexes from their precursors by Dicer-like 1 (DCL1). They are incorporated into Argonaute 1 (AGO1) protein to regulate target gene expression primarily through mRNA cleavage. We report here the discovery of a class of miRNAs in the model monocot rice (Oryza sativa). These are 24 nt in length and require another member of the Dicer family, DCL3, for their biogenesis. The 24 nt long miRNAs (lmiRNAs) are loaded into AGO4 clade proteins according to hierarchical rules, depending on the upstream biogenesis machinery and the 5'-terminal nucleotide. We demonstrated that lmiRNAs direct DNA methylation at loci from which they are produced as well as in trans at their target genes and play roles in gene regulation. Considered together, our findings define a miRNA pathway that mediates DNA methylation."

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) and short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are the two principal categories of small RNAs that induce RNAi in a broad spectrum of eukaryotic organisms including human cells. miRNAs have an enormous capacity to regulate multiple genes and the expression of approximately 30% of the human genes is affected by these non-coding RNAs. Because many miRNAs are specifically expressed during disease, miRNAs are interesting tools for pharmacology and understanding the function of specific miRNAs will help to identify novel drug targets. Furthermore, miRNA-based diagnostics as well as therapeutic interventions are being developed for clinical applications."

        "abstract": "It is well established that 20- to 30-nt small RNAs, including small interfering RNAs, microRNAs and Piwi-interacting RNAs, play crucial roles in regulating gene expression and control a surprisingly diverse array of biological processes. These small RNAs cannot work alone: they must form effector ribonucleoprotein complexes - RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISCs) - to exert their function. Thus, RISC assembly is a key process in small RNA-mediated silencing. Recent biochemical analyses of RISC assembly, together with new structural studies of Argonaute, the core protein component of RISC, suggest a revised view of how mature RISC, which contains single-stranded guide RNA, is built from small RNAs that are born double-stranded."

        "title": "A miRacle in plant development: role of microRNAs in cell differentiation and patterning.",
        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small regulatory RNAs, which control gene expression in eukaryotes. In plants they repress mRNA targets containing a highly complementary site, either by cleavage or translational repression. Studies of individual miRNA/target interactions highlight the involvement of the miRNA-based regulations in a broad range of developmental programs, throughout plant lifecycle. MicroRNAs can have distinct regulatory functions on their targets: some determine their spatial accumulation, some have a buffering role that ensures the robustness of their expression pattern, and finally others establish the temporal expression of targeted genes."

        "abstract": "microRNAs (miRNAs) are an abundant class of approximately 22 nucleotide (nt) regulatory RNAs that are pervasive in higher eukaryotic genomes. In order to fully understand their prominence in genomes, it is necessary to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that can diversify miRNA activities. In this review, we describe some of the many strategies that allow novel miRNA functions to emerge, with particular emphasis on how miRNA genes evolve in animals. These mechanisms include changes in their sequence, processing, or expression pattern; acquisition of miRNA* functionality or antisense processing; and de novo gene birth. The facility and versatility of miRNAs to evolve and change likely underlies how they have become dominant constituents of higher genomes."

        "abstract": "Since the discovery of microRNAs (miRNAs) in Caenorhabditis elegans, mounting evidence illustrates the important regulatory roles for miRNAs in various developmental, differentiation, cell proliferation, and apoptosis pathways of diverse organisms. We are just beginning to elucidate novel aspects of RNA mediated gene regulation and to understand how heavily various molecular pathways rely on miRNAs for their normal function. miRNAs are small non-protein-coding transcripts that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally by targeting messenger RNAs (mRNAs). While individual miRNAs have been specifically linked to critical developmental pathways, the deregulated expression of many miRNAs also has been shown to have functional significance for multiple human diseases, such as cancer. We continue to discover novel functional roles for miRNAs at a rapid pace. Here, we summarize some of the key recent findings on miRNAs, their mode of action, and their roles in both normal development and in human pathology. A better understanding of how miRNAs operate during the normal life of a cell as well as in the pathogenesis of disease when deregulated will provide new avenues for diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic applications."

Our observations on length heterogeneity at 5' and/or 3' ends of nine miRNAs between cloned and predicted sequences, and three mature forms deriving from the same arm of putative pre-miRNAs suggest a mechanism by which miRNAs gain new functions. Analyzing development-related miRNAs expression at 14 developmental stages based on clone-sampling and stem-loop RT PCR, we discovered an unusual abundance of 33 sequences representing 12 different miRNAs and sharply fluctuated expression of miRNAs at larva-molting stage. The potential functions of several stage-biased miRNAs were also analyzed in combination with predicted target genes and silkworm's phenotypic traits; our results indicated that miRNAs may play key regulatory roles in specific developmental stages in the silkworm, such as ecdysis."

With thousands of miRNA genes identified and genome sequences of diverse eukaryotes available for comparison, the opportunity emerges for insights into the origin and evolution of RNA interference (RNAi). The miRNA repertoires of plants and animals appear to have evolved independently. However, conservation of the key proteins involved in RNAi suggests that the last common ancestor of modern eukaryotes possessed siRNA-based mechanisms. Prokaryotes have an RNAi-like defense system that is functionally analogous but not homologous to eukaryotic RNAi. The protein machinery of eukaryotic RNAi seems to have been pieced together from ancestral archaeal, bacterial and phage proteins that are involved in DNA repair and RNA processing."

        "abstract": "It is apparent that microRNAs (miRNAs) are important components in the regulation of genetic networks in many biological contexts. Based on computational analysis, typical miRNAs are inferred to have tens to hundreds of conserved targets. Many miRNA-target interactions have been validated by various means, including heterologous tests in cultured cells and gain-of-function approaches that can yield striking phenotypes in whole animals. However, these strategies do not report on the endogenous importance of such miRNA activities. Likewise, studies of miRNA pathway mutants can suggest an endogenous role for miRNAs in a given setting, but do not identify roles for specific miRNAs. Therefore, these approaches must be complemented with the analysis of miRNA mutant alleles. In this review, we describe some of the lessons learned from studying miRNA gene deletions in worms, flies and mice, and discuss their implications for the control of endogenous regulatory networks."

This has changed dramatically with the recent discovery of diverse intramolecular and intermolecular substrates that generate endo-siRNAs in Drosophila melanogaster and mice.

        "title": "EBV-encoded miRNAs.",
        "abstract": "The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is an oncogenic Herpes virus involved in the induction of a variety of human tumours. It was the first virus found to encode microRNAs (miRNAs). MiRNAs are short, non-coding RNAs that in most cases negatively regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. EBV-transformed cells express at least 44 mature viral miRNAs that target viral and cellular genes. In addition, EBV-infection severely deregulates the miRNA profile of the host cell. The presently available information indicates that the virus uses its miRNAs to inhibit the apoptotic response of the infected cell as a means to establish a latent infection. Likewise, EBV-encoded miRNAs interfere in the expression of viral genes in order to mask the infected cell from the immune response. Cellular targets of viral miRNAs are involved in protein traffic within the cell and regulate innate immunity. MiRNA profiling of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma (NKTL) showed that only 2% of the miRNAs are derived from the virus, while viral miRNAs comprise up to 20% of the total miRNA in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and probably contribute to the formation or maintenance of NPC. The presence of viral miRNAs in exosomes raises the fascinating possibility that virus-infected cells regulate gene expression in the surrounding tissue to avert destruction by the immune system. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: MicroRNAs in viral gene regulation."

        "abstract": "Since the discovery of microRNAs (miRNAs), the study of these small noncoding RNAs has steadily increased and more than 10,000 papers have already been published. The great interest in miRNAs reflects their central role in gene-expression regulation and the implication of miRNA-specific aberrant expression in the pathogenesis of cancer, cardiac, immune-related and other diseases. Another avenue of current research is the study of circulating miRNAs in serum, plasma, and other body fluids--miRNAs may act not only within cells, but also at other sites within the body. The presence of miRNAs in body fluids may represent a gold mine of noninvasive biomarkers in cancer. Since deregulated miRNA expression is an early event in tumorigenesis, measuring circulating miRNA levels may also be useful for early cancer detection, which can contribute greatly to the success of treatment. In this Review, we discuss the role of fluid-expressed miRNAs as reliable cancer biomarkers and treatment-response predictors as well as potential new patient selection criteria for clinical trials. In addition, we explore the concept that miRNAs could function as hormones."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are inhibitors of gene expression capable of controlling processes in normal development and cancer. In mammals, miRNAs use a seed sequence of 6-8 nucleotides (nt) to associate with 3' untranslated regions (3'UTRs) of mRNAs and inhibit their expression. Intriguingly, occasionally not only the miRNA-targeting site but also sequences in its vicinity are highly conserved throughout evolution. We therefore hypothesized that conserved regions in mRNAs may serve as docking platforms for modulators of miRNA activity. Here we demonstrate that the expression of dead end 1 (Dnd1), an evolutionary conserved RNA-binding protein (RBP), counteracts the function of several miRNAs in human cells and in primordial germ cells of zebrafish by binding mRNAs and prohibiting miRNAs from associating with their target sites. These effects of Dnd1 are mediated through uridine-rich regions present in the miRNA-targeted mRNAs. Thus, our data unravel a novel role of Dnd1 in protecting certain mRNAs from miRNA-mediated repression."

In the past few years an increasing amount of evidence showed the importance of non-coding RNA (ncRNA) in different human diseases. The microRNAs (miRNAs) are one of the groups of ncRNA. They are small RNA fragments, 19-25 nucleotides long, with a main regulatory function on both protein coding genes and non-coding RNAs. The application of microarray platforms applied to miRNA profiling determined their deregulation in virtually all human diseases that have been studied. We previously developed a custom miRNA microarray platform, and here we describe the protocol we used to work with it including the oligo design strategy, the microarray printing protocol, the target-probe hybridization and the signal detection."

        "title": "Experimental validation of miRNA targets.",
        "abstract": "MicroRNAs are natural, single-stranded, small RNA molecules that regulate gene expression by binding to target mRNAs and suppress its translation or initiate its degradation. In contrast to the identification and validation of many miRNA genes is the lack of experimental evidence identifying their corresponding mRNA targets. The most fundamental challenge in miRNA biology is to define the rules of miRNA target recognition. This is critical since the biological role of individual miRNAs will be dictated by the mRNAs that they regulate. Therefore, only as target mRNAs are validated will it be possible to establish commonalities that will enable more precise predictions of miRNA/mRNA interactions. Currently there is no clear agreement as to what experimental procedures should be followed to demonstrate that a given mRNA is a target of a specific miRNA. Therefore, this review outlines several methods by which to validate miRNA targets. Additionally, we propose that multiple criteria should be met before miRNA target validation should be considered \"confirmed.\""

        "abstract": "MicroRNA.org (http://www.microrna.org) is a comprehensive resource of microRNA target predictions and expression profiles. Target predictions are based on a development of the miRanda algorithm which incorporates current biological knowledge on target rules and on the use of an up-to-date compendium of mammalian microRNAs. MicroRNA expression profiles are derived from a comprehensive sequencing project of a large set of mammalian tissues and cell lines of normal and disease origin. Using an improved graphical interface, a user can explore (i) the set of genes that are potentially regulated by a particular microRNA, (ii) the implied cooperativity of multiple microRNAs on a particular mRNA and (iii) microRNA expression profiles in various tissues. To facilitate future updates and development, the microRNA.org database structure and software architecture is flexibly designed to incorporate new expression and target discoveries. The web resource provides users with functional information about the growing number of microRNAs and their interaction with target genes in many species and facilitates novel discoveries in microRNA gene regulation."

        "abstract": "MicroRNA-122 (miR-122) is an abundant liver-specific miRNA, implicated in fatty acid and cholesterol metabolism as well as hepatitis C viral replication. Here, we report that a systemically administered 16-nt, unconjugated LNA (locked nucleic acid)-antimiR oligonucleotide complementary to the 5' end of miR-122 leads to specific, dose-dependent silencing of miR-122 and shows no hepatotoxicity in mice. Antagonism of miR-122 is due to formation of stable heteroduplexes between the LNA-antimiR and miR-122 as detected by northern analysis. Fluorescence in situ hybridization demonstrated uptake of the LNA-antimiR in mouse liver cells, which was accompanied by markedly reduced hybridization signals for mature miR-122 in treated mice. Functional antagonism of miR-122 was inferred from a low cholesterol phenotype and de-repression within 24 h of 199 liver mRNAs showing significant enrichment for miR-122 seed matches in their 3' UTRs. Expression profiling extended to 3 weeks after the last LNA-antimiR dose revealed that most of the changes in liver gene expression were normalized to saline control levels coinciding with normalized miR-122 and plasma cholesterol levels. Combined, these data suggest that miRNA antagonists comprised of LNA are valuable tools for identifying miRNA targets in vivo and for studying the biological role of miRNAs and miRNA-associated gene-regulatory networks in a physiological context."

Although their biological roles are largely unknown, examples of their importance in cancer, metabolic disease, and viral infection are accumulating, suggesting that they represent a new class of drug targets in these and likely many other therapeutic areas. Antisense oligonucleotide approaches for inhibiting miRNA function and siRNA-like technologies for replacement of miRNAs are currently being explored as tools for uncovering miRNA biology and as potential therapeutic agents.

Using genetic deletion and transgenic approaches, we show that the evolutionarily conserved microRNA-155 (miR-155) has an important role in the mammalian immune system, specifically in regulating T helper cell differentiation and the germinal center reaction to produce an optimal T cell-dependent antibody response. miR-155 exerts this control, at least in part, by regulating cytokine production. These results also suggest that individual microRNAs can exert critical control over mammalian differentiation processes in vivo."

Although hundreds of microRNAs are present in the mammalian genome, genetic studies addressing their physiological roles are at an early stage. We have shown that mice deficient for bic/microRNA-155 are immunodeficient and display increased lung airway remodeling. We demonstrate a requirement of bic/microRNA-155 for the function of B and T lymphocytes and dendritic cells. Transcriptome analysis of bic/microRNA-155-deficient CD4+ T cells identified a wide spectrum of microRNA-155-regulated genes, including cytokines, chemokines, and transcription factors. Our work suggests that bic/microRNA-155 plays a key role in the homeostasis and function of the immune system."

        "title": "Evolutionary conservation of microRNA regulatory circuits: an examination of microRNA gene complexity and conserved microRNA-target interactions through metazoan phylogeny.",
        "abstract": "During the last decade, a variety of critical biological processes, including early embryo development, cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and metabolic regularity, have been shown to be genetically regulated by a large gene family encoding a class of tiny RNA molecules termed microRNAs (miRNAs). All miRNAs share a common biosynthetic pathway and reaction mechanisms. The sequence of many miRNAs is found to be conserved, in their mature form, among different organisms. In addition, the evolutionary appearance of multicellular organisms appears to correlate with the appearance of the miRNA pathway for regulating gene expression. The miRNA pathway has the potential to regulate vast networks of gene products in a coordinate manner. Recent evidence has not only implicated the miRNA pathway in regulating a vast array of basic cellular processes but also specialized processes that are required for cellular identity and tissue specificity. A survey of the literature shows that some miRNA pathways are conserved virtually intact throughout phylogeny while miRNA diversity also correlates with speciation. The number of miRNA genes, the expression of miRNAs, and target diversities of miRNAs tend to be positively correlated with morphological complexities observed in animals. Thus, organismal complexity can be estimated by the complexity of the miRNA circuitry. The complexity of the miRNA gene families establishes a link between genotypic complexity and phenotypic complexity in animal evolution. In this paper, we start with the discussion of miRNA conservation. Then we interpret the trends in miRNA conservation to deduce miRNA evolutionary trends in metazoans. Based on these conservation patterns observed in each component of the miRNA regulatory system, we attempt to propose a global insight on the probable consistency between morphological evolution in animals and the molecular evolution of miRNA gene activity in the cell."

        "title": "MicroRNAs in skeletal and cardiac muscle development.",
        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a recently discovered class of small non-coding RNAs, which are approximately 22 nucleotides in length. miRNAs negatively regulate gene expression by translational repression and target mRNA degradation. It has become clear that miRNAs are involved in many biological processes, including development, differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. Interestingly, many miRNAs are expressed in a tissue-specific manner and several miRNAs are specifically expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscles. In this review, we focus on those miRNAs that have been shown to be involved in muscle development. Compelling evidences have demonstrated that muscle miRNAs play an important role in the regulation of muscle proliferation and differentiation processes. However, it appears that miRNAs are not essential for early myogenesis and muscle specification. Importantly, dysregulation of miRNAs has been linked to muscle-related diseases, such as cardiac hypertrophy. A mutation resulting in a gain-of-function miRNA target site in the myostatin gene leads to down regulation of the targeted protein in Texel sheep. miRNAs therefore are a new class of regulators of muscle biology and they might become novel therapeutic targets in muscle-related human diseases."

        "abstract": "Repair of a defect in the human skin is a highly orchestrated physiological process involving numerous factors that act in a temporally resolved synergistic manner to re-establish barrier function by regenerating new skin. The inducible expression and repression of genes represents a key component of this regenerative process. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are approximately 22-nucleotide-long endogenously expressed non-coding RNAs that regulate the expression of gene products by inhibition of translation and/or transcription in animals. miRNAs play a key role in skin morphogenesis and in regulating angiogenesis. The vascular endothelial growth factor signaling path seems to be under repressor control by miRNAs. Mature miRNA-dependent mechanisms impair angiogenesis in vivo. It is critically important to recognize that the understanding of cutaneous wound healing is incomplete without appreciating the functional significance of wound-induced miRNA. Ongoing work in our laboratory has led to the observation that the cutaneous wound healing process involves changes in the expression of specific miRNA at specific phases of wound healing. We hypothesize that dysregulation of specific miRNA is critical in derailing the healing sequence in chronic problem wounds. If tested positive, this hypothesis is likely to lead to completely novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for the treatment of problem wounds."

        "title": "MicroRNA-133 controls cardiac hypertrophy.",
        "abstract": "Growing evidence indicates that microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) are involved in basic cell functions and oncogenesis. Here we report that miR-133 has a critical role in determining cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. We observed decreased expression of both miR-133 and miR-1, which belong to the same transcriptional unit, in mouse and human models of cardiac hypertrophy. In vitro overexpression of miR-133 or miR-1 inhibited cardiac hypertrophy. In contrast, suppression of miR-133 by 'decoy' sequences induced hypertrophy, which was more pronounced than that after stimulation with conventional inducers of hypertrophy. In vivo inhibition of miR-133 by a single infusion of an antagomir caused marked and sustained cardiac hypertrophy. We identified specific targets of miR-133: RhoA, a GDP-GTP exchange protein regulating cardiac hypertrophy; Cdc42, a signal transduction kinase implicated in hypertrophy; and Nelf-A/WHSC2, a nuclear factor involved in cardiogenesis. Our data show that miR-133, and possibly miR-1, are key regulators of cardiac hypertrophy, suggesting their therapeutic application in heart disease."

        "abstract": "Endogenous small RNAs function in RNA interference (RNAi) pathways to control gene expression through mRNA cleavage, translational repression, or chromatin modification. Plants and animals contain many microRNAs (miRNAs) that play vital roles in development, including helping to specify cell type and tissue identity. To date, no miRNAs have been reported in unicellular organisms. Here we show that Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a unicellular green alga, encodes many miRNAs. We also show that a Chlamydomonas miRNA can direct the cleavage of its target mRNA in vivo and in vitro. We further show that the expression of some miRNAs/Candidates increases or decreases during Chlamydomonas gametogenesis. In addition to miRNAs, Chlamydomonas harbors other types of small RNAs including phased small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that are reminiscent of plant trans-acting siRNAs, as well as siRNAs originating from protein-coding genes and transposons. Our findings suggest that the miRNA pathway and some siRNA pathways are ancient mechanisms of gene regulation that evolved prior to the emergence of multicellularity."

        "title": "MicroRNA expression distinguishes between germinal center B cell-like and activated B cell-like subtypes of diffuse large B cell lymphoma.",
        "abstract": "Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is an aggressive malignancy that accounts for nearly 40% of all lymphoid tumors. This heterogeneous disease can be divided into germinal center B cell-like (GCB) and activated B cell-like (ABC) subtypes by gene expression and immunohistochemical profiling. Using microarray analysis on prototypic cell lines, we identified microRNAs (miR-155, miR-21 and miR-221) that were more highly expressed in ABC-type than GCB-type cell lines. These microRNAs were over-expressed in de novo DLBCL (n = 35), transformed DLBCL (n = 14) and follicular center lymphoma cases (n = 27) compared to normal B cells. Consistent with the cell line model, expression levels were higher in DLBCL cases with an ABC-type immunophenotype than those that were GCB-type (p < 0.05). Moreover, using multivariate analysis we found that expression of miR-21 was an independent prognostic indicator in de novo DLBCL (p < 0.05). Interestingly, expression levels of both miR-155 and miR-21 were also higher in nonmalignant ABC than in GCB cells. As we also demonstrate that expression of microRNAs can be measured reliably from routine paraffin-embedded biopsies of more than 8-years-old (p < 0.001), we suggest that microRNAs could be clinically useful molecular markers for DLBCL as well as other cancers."

        "abstract": "Micro (mi)RNAs are emerging as important regulators of cellular differentiation, their importance underscored by the fact that they are often dysregulated during carcinogenesis. Two evolutionary conserved families, let-7 and miR-200, regulate key differentiation processes during development. Loss of let-7 in cancer results in reverse embryogenesis and dedifferentiation, and miR-200 has been identified as a powerful regulator of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Recent findings have connected let-7 with stem cell maintenance and point at a connection between EMT and stem cell formation. A part of tumor progression can be viewed as a continuum of progressive dedifferentiation (EMT) with a cell at the endpoint that has stem cell-like properties. I propose that steps of this process are driven by specific changes in the expression of let-7 and miR-200 family members."

Specialized ribonucleases and RNA-binding proteins govern the production and action of small regulatory RNAs. After initial processing in the nucleus by Drosha, precursor microRNAs (pre-miRNAs) are transported to the cytoplasm, where Dicer cleavage generates mature microRNAs (miRNAs) and short interfering RNAs (siRNAs). These double-stranded products assemble with Argonaute proteins such that one strand is preferentially selected and used to guide sequence-specific silencing of complementary target mRNAs by endonucleolytic cleavage or translational repression. Molecular structures of Dicer and Argonaute proteins, and of RNA-bound complexes, have offered exciting insights into the mechanisms operating at the heart of RNA-silencing pathways."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous, small, non-coding RNAs, which are capable of silencing gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. In this study, we report that miR-205 is significantly underexpressed in breast tumor compared to the matched normal breast tissue. Similarly, breast cancer cell lines, including MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, express a lower level miR-205 than the non-malignant MCF-10A cells. Of interest, ectopic expression of miR-205 significantly inhibits cell proliferation and anchorage independent growth, as well as cell invasion. Furthermore, miR-205 was shown to suppress lung metastasis in an animal model. Finally, western blot combined with the luciferase reporter assays demonstrate that ErbB3 and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) are direct targets for miR-205, and this miR-205-mediated suppression is likely through the direct interaction with the putative miR-205 binding site in the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of ErbB3 and VEGF-A. Together, these results suggest that miR-205 is a tumor suppressor in breast cancer."

        "abstract": "Over the last decade, approximately 20-30 nucleotide RNA molecules have emerged as critical regulators in the expression and function of eukaryotic genomes. Two primary categories of these small RNAs--short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs)--act in both somatic and germline lineages in a broad range of eukaryotic species to regulate endogenous genes and to defend the genome from invasive nucleic acids. Recent advances have revealed unexpected diversity in their biogenesis pathways and the regulatory mechanisms that they access. Our understanding of siRNA- and miRNA-based regulation has direct implications for fundamental biology as well as disease etiology and treatment."

        "abstract": "Transposons populate the landscape of all eukaryotic genomes. Often considered purely genomic parasites, transposons can also benefit their hosts, playing roles in gene regulation and in genome organization and evolution. Peaceful coexistence with mobile elements depends upon adaptive control mechanisms, since unchecked transposon activity can impact long-term fitness and acutely reduce the fertility of progeny. Here, we review the conserved roles played by small RNAs in the adaptation of eukaryotes to coexist with their genomic colonists. An understanding of transposon-defense pathways has uncovered recurring themes in the mechanisms by which genomes distinguish \"self\" from \"non-self\" and selectively silence the latter."

        "abstract": "The impact of small RNA function has resonated throughout nearly every aspect of eukaryotic biology and captured the varied interests of researchers, whether they are endeavoring to understand the basis of development and disease or seeking novel therapeutic targets and tools. The genetic regulatory roles of microRNAs (miRNAs) are particularly interesting given that these often highly conserved factors post-transcriptionally silence many complementary target genes by inhibiting messenger RNA translation. In this regard, miRNAs can be considered as counterparts to transcription factors, the ensemble of which establishes the set of expressed genes that define the characteristics of a specific cell type. In this review, evidence supporting a resounding role for small RNAs in development and maturation of sensory epithelia in the mouse inner ear will be considered with an emphasis on the contribution of one hair cell miRNA family (miR-183, miR-96, and miR-182). Although there is much yet to be explored in this fledgling aspect of ear biology, the breadth of miRNA expression and functional requirement for ear development are already sounding off."

Although their mode of action has attracted great attention, the principles governing their expression and activity are only beginning to emerge. Recent studies have introduced a paradigm shift in our understanding of the microRNA biogenesis pathway, which was previously believed to be universal to all microRNAs. Maturation steps specific to individual microRNAs have been uncovered, and these offer a plethora of regulatory options after transcription with multiple proteins affecting microRNA processing efficiency. Here we review the recent advances in knowledge of the microRNA biosynthesis pathways and discuss their impact on post-transcriptional microRNA regulation during tumour development."

Complete loss of miRNA expression in the brain leads to neurodegeneration in several animal models. Evidence from patient material is emerging that miRNA dysregulation could, indeed, contribute to neurodegenerative disorders. The translation of proteins previously implicated in familial forms of disease seems to be under control of miRNAs, and changes in miRNAs might explain how these proteins become affected in sporadic neurodegenerative disease. Thus, miRNAs are moving rapidly center stage as key regulators of neuronal development and function in addition to important contributors to neurodegenerative disorder."

We have established an in vitro system that recapitulates translational repression mediated by the two Drosophila Argonaute (Ago) subfamily proteins, Ago1 and Ago2. We find that Ago1-RISC (RNA-induced silencing complex) represses translation primarily by ATP-dependent shortening of the poly(A) tail of its mRNA targets. Ago1-RISC can also secondarily block a step after cap recognition. In contrast, Ago2-RISC competitively blocks the interaction of eIF4E with eIF4G and inhibits the cap function. Our finding that the two Ago proteins in flies regulate translation by different mechanisms may reconcile previous, contradictory explanations for how miRNAs repress protein synthesis."

Here, we report the essential information on biogenesis of miRNAs and recent evidence on their important role in human diseases. Emphasis has been given to miR-155, since this molecule represents a typical multifunctional miRNA. Recent data indicate that miR-155 has distinct expression profiles and plays a crucial role in various physiological and pathological processes such as haematopoietic lineage differentiation, immunity, inflammation, cancer, and cardiovascular diseases. Moreover, miR-155 has been found to be implicated in viral infections, particularly in those caused by DNA viruses. The available experimental evidence indicating that miR-155 is over expressed in a variety of malignant tumors allows us to include this miRNA in the list of genes of paramount importance in cancer diagnosis and prognosis. Exogenous molecular control in vivo of miR-155 expression could open up new ways to restrain malignant growth and viral infections, or to attenuate the progression of cardiovascular diseases."

        "abstract": "Metazoan genomes contain thousands of protein-coding and non-coding RNA genes, most of which are differentially expressed, i.e., at different locations, at different times during development, or in response to environmental signals. Differential gene expression is achieved through complex regulatory networks that are controlled in part by two types of trans-regulators: transcription factors (TFs) and microRNAs (miRNAs). TFs bind to cis-regulatory DNA elements that are often located in or near their target genes, while miRNAs hybridize to cis-regulatory RNA elements mostly located in the 3' untranslated region of their target mRNAs. Here, we describe how these trans-regulators interact with each other in the context of gene regulatory networks to coordinate gene expression at the genome-scale level, and discuss future challenges of integrating these networks with other types of functional networks."

MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a class of noncoding RNAs, have emerged as important regulators of organogenesis in insects, fish and mammals. The microRNA repertoire of animals has expanded significantly during evolution especially in vertebrates, insects and nematodes, accompanying the appearance of complex body plans. MicroRNAs therefore have gained enormous interest in recent years. They are now regarded as key modulators of gene expression in many tissues during embryogenesis, in adult organisms and in disease processes. Therefore, these small RNA molecules have entered the center stage of molecular biology and are promising candidates not only for the regulation of key biological processes such as proliferation and apoptosis, but also for therapy of human diseases."

These small non-coding RNAs bind to target sequences in mRNAs, typically resulting in repressed gene expression. Several methods are now available for identifying miRNA target sites, but the mere presence of an miRNA-binding site is insufficient for predicting target regulation. Regulation of targets by miRNAs is subject to various levels of control, and recent developments have presented a new twist; targets can reciprocally control the level and function of miRNAs. This mutual regulation of miRNAs and target genes is challenging our understanding of the gene-regulatory role of miRNAs in vivo and has important implications for the use of these RNAs in therapeutic settings."

        "abstract": "MicroRNA (miRNA) is a type of short-length (~22\u2009nt) non-coding RNA. Most miRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II and processed by Drosha-DGCR8 and Dicer complexes in the cropping and dicing steps, respectively. miRNAs are exported by exportin-5 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm after cropping. Trimmed mature miRNA is loaded and targets mRNA at the 3' or 5' untranslated region (UTR) by recognition of base-pairing in the miRNA-loaded RISC, where it is involved in gene silencing including translational repression and/or degradation along with deadenylation. Recent studies have shown that miRNA participates in various biological functions including cell fate decision, developmental timing regulation, apoptosis, and tumorigenesis. Analyses of miRNA expression profiles have demonstrated tissue- and stage-specific miRNAs including the let-7 family, miR-124, and miR-9, which regulate the differentiation of embryonic stem cells and/or neurogenesis. This review focuses on RNA-binding protein-mediated miRNA biogenesis during neurogenesis. These miRNA biogenesis-relating proteins have also been linked to human diseases because their mutations can cause several nervous system disorders. Moreover, defects in core proteins involved in miRNA biogenesis including Drosha, DGCR8, and Dicer promote tumorigenesis. Thus, the study of not only mature miRNA function but also miRNA biogenesis steps is likely to be important."

        "title": "Genetics and biochemistry of RNAi in Drosophila.",
        "abstract": "RNA interference (RNAi) is the technique employing double-stranded RNA to target the destruction of homologous messenger RNAs. It has gained wide usage in genetics. While having the potential for many practical applications, it is a reflection of a much broader spectrum of small RNA-mediated processes in the cell. The RNAi machinery was originally perceived as a defense mechanism against viruses and transposons. While this is certainly true, small RNAs have now been implicated in many other aspects of cell biology. Here we review the current knowledge of the biochemistry of RNAi in Drosophila and the involvement of small RNAs in RNAi, transposon silencing, virus defense, transgene silencing, pairing-sensitive silencing, telomere function, chromatin insulator activity, nucleolar stability, and heterochromatin formation. The discovery of the role of RNA molecules in the degradation of mRNA transcripts leading to decreased gene expression resulted in a paradigm shift in the field of molecular biology. Transgene silencing was first discovered in plant cells (Matzke et al. 1989; van der Krol et al. 1990; Napoli et al. 1990) and can occur on both the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels, but both involve short RNA moieties in their mechanism. RNA interference (RNAi) is a type of gene silencing mechanism in which a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecule directs the specific degradation of the corresponding mRNA (target RNA). The technique of RNAi was first discovered in Caenorhabditis elegans in 1994 (Guo and Kemphues 1994). Later the active component was found to be a dsRNA (Fire et al. 1998). In subsequent years, it has been found to occur in diverse eukaryotes"

Soon after, studies from a few groups identified a number of miRNAs from Arabidopsis, providing the first evidence for the existence of these regulatory molecules in plants. Since then, numerous miRNAs from a number of land plants ranging from mosses to flowering plants were identified, and functional studies in Arabidopsis established a framework of understanding of miRNA biogenesis and function. This chapter summarizes the current knowledge as well as gaps in our understanding of plant miRNA biogenesis and function."

        "title": "MicroRNA-21 targets tumor suppressor genes in invasion and metastasis.",
        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of naturally occurring small non-coding RNAs that target protein-coding mRNAs at the post-transcriptional level. Our previous studies suggest that mir-21 functions as an oncogene and has a role in tumorigenesis, in part through regulation of the tumor suppressor gene tropomyosin 1 (TPM1). Given that TPM1 has been implicated in cell migration, in this study we further investigated the role of mir-21 in cell invasion and tumor metastasis. We found that suppression of mir-21 in metastatic breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells significantly reduced invasion and lung metastasis. Consistent with this, ectopic expression of TPM1 remarkably reduced cell invasion. Furthermore, we identified two additional direct mir-21 targets, programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4) and maspin, both of which have been implicated in invasion and metastasis. Like TPM1, PDCD4 and maspin also reduced invasiveness of MDA-MB-231 cells. Finally, the expression of PDCD4 and maspin inversely correlated with mir-21 expression in human breast tumor specimens, indicating the potential regulation of PDCD4 and maspin by mir-21 in these tumors. Taken together, the results suggest that, as an oncogenic miRNA, mir-21 has a role not only in tumor growth but also in invasion and tumor metastasis by targeting multiple tumor/metastasis suppressor genes. Therefore, suppression of mir-21 may provide a novel approach for the treatment of advanced cancers."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs are abundant in animal genomes and have been predicted to have important roles in a broad range of gene expression programmes. Despite this prominence, there is a dearth of functional knowledge regarding individual mammalian microRNAs. Using a loss-of-function allele in mice, we report here that the myeloid-specific microRNA-223 (miR-223) negatively regulates progenitor proliferation and granulocyte differentiation and activation. miR-223 (also called Mirn223) mutant mice have an expanded granulocytic compartment resulting from a cell-autonomous increase in the number of granulocyte progenitors. We show that Mef2c, a transcription factor that promotes myeloid progenitor proliferation, is a target of miR-223, and that genetic ablation of Mef2c suppresses progenitor expansion and corrects the neutrophilic phenotype in miR-223 null mice. In addition, granulocytes lacking miR-223 are hypermature, hypersensitive to activating stimuli and display increased fungicidal activity. As a consequence of this neutrophil hyperactivity, miR-223 mutant mice spontaneously develop inflammatory lung pathology and exhibit exaggerated tissue destruction after endotoxin challenge. Our data support a model in which miR-223 acts as a fine-tuner of granulocyte production and the inflammatory response."

        "title": "miRNAs: effectors of environmental influences on gene expression and disease.",
        "abstract": "Discovered less than a decade ago, micro-RNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as important regulators of gene expression in mammals. They consist of short nucleic acids, on average approximately 22 nucleotides in length. The miRNAs exert their effect by binding directly to target messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and inhibiting mRNA stability and translation. Each miRNA can bind to multiple targets and many miRNAs can bind to the same target mRNA, allowing for a complex pattern of regulation of gene expression. Once bound to their targets, miRNAs can suppress translation of the mRNA by either sequestration or degradation of the message. Thus, miRNAs function as powerful and sensitive posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression. This review will summarize what is known about miRNA biogenesis, expression, regulation, function, mode of action, and role in disease processes with an emphasis on miRNAs in mammals. We discuss some of the methodology employed in miRNA research and the potential of miRNAs as therapeutic targets. The role of miRNAs in signal transduction and cellular stress is reviewed. Lastly, we identify new exciting avenues of research on the role of miRNAs in toxicogenomics and the possibility of epigenetic effects on gene expression."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are emerging as important, albeit poorly characterized, regulators of biological processes. Key to further elucidation of their roles is the generation of more complete lists of their numbers and expression changes in different cell states. Here, we report a new method for surveying the expression of small RNAs, including microRNAs, using Illumina sequencing technology. We also present a set of methods for annotating sequences deriving from known miRNAs, identifying variability in mature miRNA sequences, and identifying sequences belonging to previously unidentified miRNA genes. Application of this approach to RNA from human embryonic stem cells obtained before and after their differentiation into embryoid bodies revealed the sequences and expression levels of 334 known plus 104 novel miRNA genes. One hundred seventy-one known and 23 novel microRNA sequences exhibited significant expression differences between these two developmental states. Owing to the increased number of sequence reads, these libraries represent the deepest miRNA sampling to date, spanning nearly six orders of magnitude of expression. The predicted targets of those miRNAs enriched in either sample shared common features. Included among the high-ranked predicted gene targets are those implicated in differentiation, cell cycle control, programmed cell death, and transcriptional regulation."

        "abstract": "Safe and effective gene therapy approaches require targeted tissue-specific transfer of a therapeutic transgene. Besides traditional approaches, such as transcriptional and transductional targeting, microRNA-dependent post-transcriptional suppression of transgene expression has been emerging as powerful new technology to increase the specificity of vector-mediated transgene expression. MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs and often expressed in a tissue-, lineage-, activation- or differentiation-specific pattern. They typically regulate gene expression by binding to imperfectly complementary sequences in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the mRNA. To control exogenous transgene expression, tandem repeats of artificial microRNA target sites are usually incorporated into the 3' UTR of the transgene expression cassette, leading to subsequent degradation of transgene mRNA in cells expressing the corresponding microRNA. This targeting strategy, first shown for lentiviral vectors in antigen presenting cells, has now been used for tissue-specific expression of vector-encoded therapeutic transgenes, to reduce immune response against the transgene, to control virus tropism for oncolytic virotherapy, to increase safety of live attenuated virus vaccines and to identify and select cell subsets for pluripotent stem cell therapies, respectively. This review provides an introduction into the technical mechanism underlying microRNA-regulation, highlights new developments in this field and gives an overview of applications of microRNA-regulated viral vectors for cardiac, suicide gene cancer and hematopoietic stem cell therapy, as well as for treatment of neurological and eye diseases."

        "abstract": "The canonical role of messenger RNA (mRNA) is to deliver protein-coding information to sites of protein synthesis. However, given that microRNAs bind to RNAs, we hypothesized that RNAs could possess a regulatory role that relies on their ability to compete for microRNA binding, independently of their protein-coding function. As a model for the protein-coding-independent role of RNAs, we describe the functional relationship between the mRNAs produced by the PTEN tumour suppressor gene and its pseudogene PTENP1 and the critical consequences of this interaction. We find that PTENP1 is biologically active as it can regulate cellular levels of PTEN and exert a growth-suppressive role. We also show that the PTENP1 locus is selectively lost in human cancer. We extended our analysis to other cancer-related genes that possess pseudogenes, such as oncogenic KRAS. We also demonstrate that the transcripts of protein-coding genes such as PTEN are biologically active. These findings attribute a novel biological role to expressed pseudogenes, as they can regulate coding gene expression, and reveal a non-coding function for mRNAs."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an abundant class of small non-coding RNAs that collectively regulate the expression of a large number of mRNAs by either promoting destabilization or repressing translation, or both. Therefore, they play a major role in shaping the transcriptomes and proteomes of eukaryotic organisms. Typically, animal miRNAs are produced from long primary transcripts with one or more of hairpin structures by two sequential processing reactions: one by Drosha in the nucleus and the other by Dicer in the cytoplasm. However, deviations from this paradigm have been observed: subclasses of miRNAs, which only partially meet the classical definition of a miRNA, are derived by alternative biogenesis pathways, thereby providing an additional level of complexity to miRNA-dependent regulation of gene expression."

        "abstract": "Esophageal cancer is the eighth most common cancer and causes the sixth highest cancer-related mortality worldwide. The 5-year survival of patients suffering from esophageal cancer in either advanced stage or metastasis is less than 20%. MicroRNAs are small, well conserved, non-coding RNA molecules that either repress translation or promote mRNA degradation based on the degree of complementary between miRNAs and mRNAs. Based on biogenesis and function of microRNAs, specific microRNA profiles, either from cancerous tissues or serum, were able to serve as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of esophageal cancer and predicted the effectiveness of surgery and chemoradiotherapy. MicroRNAs could also influence the biological behaviors of esophageal cancer cells, such as cellular proliferation, apoptosis, invasion and metastasis. MicroRNAs were also associated with multi-drug resistance of esophageal cancer. Further studies on the roles of microRNAs in esophageal cancer would provide a strategy to prevent and treat esophageal cancer, and reverse multi-drug resistance of esophageal cancer."

        "title": "A novel class of bacteria-induced small RNAs in Arabidopsis.",
        "abstract": "Small RNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), are essential regulatory molecules of many cellular processes. Arabidopsis has at least three classes of endogenous siRNAs--chromatin-associated siRNAs, trans-acting siRNAs (tasiRNAs), and natural antisense transcript (NAT)-associated siRNAs (nat-siRNAs)--all 20-25 nucleotides (nt) in length. Here, we identified a novel class of small RNAs, long siRNAs (lsiRNAs), which are 30-40 nt and share many common features with known siRNAs. The lsiRNAs identified so far are induced by pathogen infection or under specific growth conditions. One of the lsiRNAs, AtlsiRNA-1, is generated from SRRLK/AtRAP NAT pair and specifically induced by the bacterium Pseudomonas syringae carrying effector avrRpt2. Recently, 25- to 31-nt PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) and repeat-associated siRNAs (rasiRNAs) were identified in animal germline cells. In contrast to the biogenesis of piRNAs/rasiRNAs, which is dicer independent and requires PIWI subfamily proteins, generation of AtlsiRNA-1 requires DCL1, DCL4, and the ARGONAUTE subfamily protein AGO7. It also depends on HYL1, HEN1, HST1, RDR6, and Pol IV. Induction of AtlsiRNA-1 silences AtRAP, which encodes a RAP-domain protein involved in disease resistance. Our further analysis implies that AtlsiRNA-1 may destabilize target mRNA through decapping and XRN4-mediated 5'-to-3' degradation."

        "abstract": "Very little is known regarding regulation of microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis in normal tissues, tumors, and cell lines. Here, we profiled the expression of 225 precursor and mature miRNAs using real-time PCR and compared the expression levels to determine the processing patterns. RNA from 22 different human tissues, 37 human cancer cell lines, and 16 pancreas and liver tissues/tumors was profiled. The relationship between precursor and mature miRNA expression fell into the following four categories: (1) a direct correlation exists between the precursor and mature miRNA expression in all cells/tissues studied; (2) direct correlation of the precursor and mature miRNA exists, yet the expression is restricted to specific cell lines or tissues; (3) there is detectable expression of mature miRNA in certain cells and tissues while the precursor is expressed in all or most cells/tissues; or (4) both precursor and mature miRNA are not expressed. Pearson correlation between the precursor and mature miRNA expression was closer to one for the tissues but was closer to zero for the cell lines, suggesting that processing of precursor miRNAs is reduced in cancer cell lines. By using Northern blotting, we show that many of these miRNAs (e.g., miR-31, miR-105 and miR-128a) are processed to the precursor, but in situ hybridization analysis demonstrates that these miRNA precursors are retained in the nucleus. We provide a database of the levels of precursor and mature miRNA in a variety of cell types. Our data demonstrate that a large number of miRNAs are transcribed but are not processed to the mature miRNA."

        "abstract": "The infection and replication of viruses in the host induce diverse mechanisms for combating viral infection. One of the best-studied antiviral defence mechanisms is based on RNA silencing. Consistently, several viral suppressors of RNA silencing (VSRs) have been identified from almost all plant virus genera, which are surprisingly diverse within and across kingdoms, exhibiting no obvious sequence similarities. VSRs efficiently inhibit host antiviral responses by interacting with the key components of cellular silencing machinery, often mimicking their normal cellular functions. Recent findings have revealed that the impact of VSRs on endogenous pathways is more complex and profound than had been estimated thus far. This review highlights the current understanding of and new insights into the mechanisms and functions of plant VSRs."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of noncoding RNAs that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression in plants and animals. To investigate the influence of miRNAs on transcript levels, we transfected miRNAs into human cells and used microarrays to examine changes in the messenger RNA profile. Here we show that delivering miR-124 causes the expression profile to shift towards that of brain, the organ in which miR-124 is preferentially expressed, whereas delivering miR-1 shifts the profile towards that of muscle, where miR-1 is preferentially expressed. In each case, about 100 messages were downregulated after 12 h. The 3' untranslated regions of these messages had a significant propensity to pair to the 5' region of the miRNA, as expected if many of these messages are the direct targets of the miRNAs. Our results suggest that metazoan miRNAs can reduce the levels of many of their target transcripts, not just the amount of protein deriving from these transcripts. Moreover, miR-1 and miR-124, and presumably other tissue-specific miRNAs, seem to downregulate a far greater number of targets than previously appreciated, thereby helping to define tissue-specific gene expression in humans."

        "abstract": "Two classes of short RNA molecule, small interfering RNA (siRNA) and microRNA (miRNA), have been identified as sequence-specific posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression. siRNA and miRNA are incorporated into related RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISCs), termed siRISC and miRISC, respectively. The current model argues that siRISC and miRISC are functionally interchangeable and target specific mRNAs for cleavage or translational repression, depending on the extent of sequence complementarity between the small RNA and its target. Emerging evidence indicates, however, that siRISC and miRISC are distinct complexes that regulate mRNA stability and translation. The assembly of RISCs can be traced from the biogenesis of the small RNA molecules and the recruitment of these RNAs by the RISC loading complex (RLC) to the transition of the RLC into the active RISC. Target recognition by the RISC can then take place through different interacting modes."

        "abstract": "Methylation on the base or the ribose is prevalent in eukaryotic ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) and is thought to be crucial for ribosome biogenesis and function. Artificially introduced 2'-O-methyl groups in small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) can stabilize siRNAs in serum without affecting their activities in RNA interference in mammalian cells. Here, we show that plant microRNAs (miRNAs) have a naturally occurring methyl group on the ribose of the last nucleotide. Whereas methylation of rRNAs depends on guide RNAs, the methyltransferase protein HEN1 is sufficient to methylate miRNA/miRNA* duplexes. Our studies uncover a new and crucial step in plant miRNA biogenesis and have profound implications in the function of miRNAs."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of 21- to 25-nucleotide, noncoding small RNAs that primarily function as gene regulators. It is surprising that these tiny molecules, so diverse and consequential in their biological functions, have been hidden for so many years. Thanks to their discovery, cancer research has found a new arena. Aided by innovative molecular techniques, the research of miRNAs in oncology has progressed rapidly in recent years. miRNA abnormalities are becoming an emerging theme in cancer research. Specific functions of miRNAs, many of which are relevant to cancer development, are becoming apparent. The value of miRNAs in cancer classification and prognostication is being explored, and new therapeutic strategies targeting miRNAs are being developed. Because there is great promise that miRNA research will provide breakthroughs in the understanding of cancer pathogenesis and development of new valuable prognostic markers, pathologists should be adequately informed of this rapidly progressing field. Here, we offer a review on the basics of miRNA biology and the emerging role of miRNA in cancer pathogenesis, classification, and prognostication, including highlights of the involvement of specific miRNAs in different tumor types."

        "title": "Tissue-dependent paired expression of miRNAs.",
        "abstract": "It is believed that depending on the thermodynamic stability of the 5'-strand and the 3'-strand in the stem-loop structure of a precursor microRNA (pre-miRNA), cells preferentially select the less stable one (called the miRNA or guide strand) and destroy the other one (called the miRNA* or passenger strand). However, our expression profiling analyses revealed that both strands could be co-accumulated as miRNA pairs in some tissues while being subjected to strand selection in other tissues. Our target prediction and validation assays demonstrated that both strands of a miRNA pair could target equal numbers of genes and that both were able to suppress the expression of their target genes. Our finding not only suggests that the numbers of miRNAs and their targets are much greater than what we previously thought, but also implies that novel mechanisms are involved in the tissue-dependent miRNA biogenesis and target selection process."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs are a recently discovered class of short (approximately 22 nucleotide) naturally occurring RNA molecules that negatively regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally. There has been an explosion of interest in the microRNA field as these molecules have been found to play key roles in a wide range of biological processes and to be aberrantly expressed in many types of cancer, including haematological malignancies. Cancer-associated microRNAs can act as both tumour suppressor molecules (e.g., miR-15a and miR-16-1) and have oncogenic properties (e.g., miR-155 and miR-17-92 cluster). In this review the authors discuss the rapidly accumulating evidence for the central role that microRNAs play in both haematopoiesis and haematological malignancy, in particular focusing on their role in lymphoma."

        "title": "miRNA genetic alterations in human cancers.",
        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous, non-coding, small RNAs, which negatively regulate gene expression in a sequence-specific manner via translational repression and/or mRNA degradation. Their discovery revealed a new and exciting aspect of post-transcriptional gene regulation that is universally involved in cellular homeostasis. Importantly, the advent of miRNAs added another level of complication in the already complex regulatory networks of the cell, undermining that RNA molecules in general, should be considered gene regulators of equal importance with proteins. Recently, the scientific community drew attention to the miRNA field for an additional reason: an increasing line of evidence indicated that miRNA genes are tightly connected with the process of tumorigenesis. Indeed, several miRNAs have already been demonstrated to behave as oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes in many types of cancer. Even though the underlying mechanisms by which miRNAs can destabilize the normal cellular processes, promoting cell transformation and tumor progression, are not well understood, genetic and epigenetic alterations most probably play a critical role. Significant technologic advances facilitated the profiling of the miRNA expression patterns in normal and cancer tissues and discovered an unexpected greater reliability of miRNA expression signatures in classifying cancer types than the respective signatures of protein-coding genes. Along with this extraordinary diagnostic potential, miRNAs have also proved their prognostic value in predicting clinical behaviors of cancer patients. The aim of this review is to describe miRNA expression and how its deregulation is involved in the pathophysiology of human cancers."

        "abstract": "Evidence is emerging that micro RNA (miRNA) is an important and potentially polymorphic regulatory layer for silencing gene expression in vivo. Knowledge of miRNA targeting may help to elucidate the function of many human genes in common diseases, providing a powerful target validation technology. Accurate in silico prediction of miRNA targets in mRNA is a critical capability, allowing effective evaluation of the impact of variation on the creation, strengthening, weakening and destruction of miRNA binding sites. Application of such analyses identifies thousands of single-nucleotide polymorphisms, which may potentially impact miRNA regulation of mRNA. The authors believe this information may offer a real opportunity to study miRNA function at a number of levels. First, sequence-focused analysis will help to define the functional boundaries of miRNA target binding. Second, one may be able to identify miRNA target variants in mRNA with a direct role in human disease, which may be valuable therapeutic targets."

        "abstract": "Dicer is the enzyme that cleaves double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) into 21-25-nt-long species responsible for sequence-specific RNA-induced gene silencing at the transcriptional, post-transcriptional, or translational level. We disrupted the dicer-1 (dcr-1) gene in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells by conditional gene targeting and generated Dicer-null ES cells. These cells were viable, despite being completely defective in RNA interference (RNAi) and the generation of microRNAs (miRNAs). However, the mutant ES cells displayed severe defects in differentiation both in vitro and in vivo. Epigenetic silencing of centromeric repeat sequences and the expression of homologous small dsRNAs were markedly reduced. Re-expression of Dicer in the knockout cells rescued these phenotypes. Our data suggest that Dicer participates in multiple, fundamental biological processes in a mammalian organism, ranging from stem cell differentiation to the maintenance of centromeric heterochromatin structure and centromeric silencing."

Various mechanisms have now been identified that regulate miRNA stability and that diversify miRNA sequences to create distinct isoforms. The production of different isoforms of individual miRNAs in specific cells and tissues may have broader implications for miRNA-mediated gene expression control. Rigorously testing the many discrepant models for how miRNAs function using quantitative biochemical measurements made in vivo and in vitro remains a major challenge for the future."

        "title": "Modulation of floral development by a gibberellin-regulated microRNA.",
        "abstract": "Floral initiation and floral organ development are both regulated by the phytohormone gibberellin (GA). For example, in short-day photoperiods, the Arabidopsis floral transition is strongly promoted by GA-mediated activation of the floral meristem-identity gene LEAFY. In addition, anther development and pollen microsporogenesis depend on GA-mediated opposition of the function of specific members of the DELLA family of GA-response repressors. We describe the role of a microRNA (miR159) in the regulation of short-day photoperiod flowering time and of anther development. MiR159 directs the cleavage of mRNA encoding GAMYB-related proteins. These proteins are transcription factors that are thought to be involved in the GA-promoted activation of LEAFY, and in the regulation of anther development. We show that miR159 levels are regulated by GA via opposition of DELLA function, and that both the sequence of miR159 and the regulation of miR159 levels by DELLA are evolutionarily conserved. Finally, we describe the phenotypic consequences of transgenic over-expression of miR159. Increased levels of miR159 cause a reduction in LEAFY transcript levels, delay flowering in short-day photoperiods, and perturb anther development. We propose that miR159 is a phytohormonally regulated homeostatic modulator of GAMYB activity, and hence of GAMYB-dependent developmental processes."

        "title": "Distinct roles for Argonaute proteins in small RNA-directed RNA cleavage pathways.",
        "abstract": "In mammalian cells, both microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are thought to be loaded into the same RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), where they guide mRNA degradation or translation silencing depending on the complementarity of the target. In Drosophila, Argonaute2 (AGO2) was identified as part of the RISC complex. Here we show that AGO2 is an essential component for siRNA-directed RNA interference (RNAi) response and is required for the unwinding of siRNA duplex and in consequence assembly of siRNA into RISC in Drosophila embryos. However, Drosophila embryos lacking AGO2, which are siRNA-directed RNAi-defective, are still capable of miRNA-directed target RNA cleavage. In contrast, Argonaute1 (AGO1), another Argonaute protein in fly, which is dispensable for siRNA-directed target RNA cleavage, is required for mature miRNA production that impacts on miRNA-directed RNA cleavage. The association of AGO1 with Dicer-1 and pre-miRNA also suggests that AGO1 is involved in miRNA biogenesis. Our findings show that distinct Argonaute proteins act at different steps of the small RNA silencing mechanism and suggest that there are inherent differences between siRNA-initiated RISCs and miRNA-initiated RISCs in Drosophila."

        "abstract": "The discovery of microRNA (miRNA) is one of the major scientific breakthroughs in recent years and has revolutionized current cell biology and medical science. miRNAs are small (19~25nt) noncoding RNA molecules that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression by targeting the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of specific messenger RNAs (mRNAs) for degradation of translation repression. Genetic ablation of the miRNA machinery, as well as loss or degradation of certain individual miRNAs, severely compromises immune development and response, and can lead to immune disorders. Several sophisticated regulatory mechanisms are used to maintain immune homeostasis. Regulatory T (Treg) cells are essential for maintaining peripheral tolerance, preventing autoimmune diseases and limiting chronic inflammatory diseases. Recent publications have provided compelling evidence that miRNAs are highly expressed in Treg cells, that the expression of Foxp3 is controlled by miRNAs and that a range of miRNAs are involved in the regulation of immunity. A large number of studies have reported links between alterations of miRNA homeostasis and pathological conditions such as cancer, cardiovascular disease and diabetes, as well as psychiatric and neurological diseases. Although it is still unclear how miRNA controls Treg cell development and function, recent studies certainly indicate that this topic will be the subject of further research. The specific circulating miRNA species may also be useful for the diagnosis, classification, prognosis of diseases and prediction of the therapeutic response. An explosive literature has focussed on the role of miRNA. In this review, I briefly summarize the current studies about the role of miRNAs in Treg cells and in the regulation of the innate and adaptive immune response. I also review the explosive current studies about clinical application of miRNA."

        "title": "Targeting miR-205 in breast cancer.",
        "abstract": "As small non-coding regulatory RNAs, microRNAs are capable of silencing gene expression by translational repression or mRNA degradation. Accumulating evidence indicates that deregulation of microRNAs is often associated with human malignancies and suggests a causal role of microRNAs in neoplasia, presumably because microRNAs can function as oncogenes or tumor suppressors. Among them, miR-205 is significantly underexpressed in breast tumors compared with matched normal breast tissue although miR-205 has been shown to be upregulated in some other type of tumors. Furthermore, breast cancer cell lines, including MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, express a lower level of miR-205 than the non-malignant MCF-10A cells. Ectopic expression of miR-205 significantly inhibits cell proliferation and anchorage-independent growth as well as cell invasion. These findings establish the tumor suppressive role of miR-205, which is probably through direct targeting of oncogenes such as ErbB3 and Zeb1. Therefore, miR-205 may serve as a unique therapeutic target for breast cancer."

Tissue and cell type-specific enrichments of certain miRNAs within the nervous system argue for a biological significance during neurodevelopmental stages. On the other hand, a large number of studies have reported links between alterations of miRNA homeostasis and pathologic conditions such as cancer, heart diseases, and neurodegeneration. Thus, profiles of distinct or aberrant miRNA signatures have most recently surged as one of the most fascinating interests in current biology. Here, the most recent insights into the involvement of miRNAs in the biology of the nervous system and the occurrence of neuropathological disorders are reviewed and discussed."

        "abstract": "The discovery of microRNA (miRNA)-mediated gene silencing has added a new level of complexity to our understanding of post-transcriptional control of gene expression. Considering the ubiquity of miRNA-mediated repression throughout basic cellular processes, understanding its mechanism of action is paramount to obtain a clear picture of the regulation of gene expression in biological systems. Although many miRNAs and their targets have been identified, a detailed understanding of miRNA action remains elusive. miRNAs regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level, through both translational inhibition and mRNA destabilization. Recent reports suggest that many miRNA effects are mediated through proteins of the GW182 family. This chapter focuses on the multiple and potentially overlapping mechanisms that miRNAs utilize to regulate gene expression in eukaryotes."

        "abstract": "lin-4 and let-7 are the founding members of the large microRNA (miRNA) family of regulatory RNAs and were originally identified as components of a C. elegans developmental pathway that controls temporal cell fates. Consistent with their pioneering role, lin-4 and let-7 were studied widely as \"model miRNAs\" in efforts to reveal the mode of action of miRNAs. Early work on lin-4 thus established a paradigm that miRNAs inhibit translation of their target mRNAs at a step downstream from initiation, without affecting mRNA stability. Although some studies on mammalian miRNAs in cell culture reached similar conclusions, most of those studies indicated that miRNAs repressed translation initiation and frequently also promoted target mRNA degradation. We will discuss here what is known about modes of miRNA target gene repression in C. elegans, highlighting recent work that demonstrates that both mRNA degradation and repression of translation initiation are mechanisms employed in vivo by let-7 and, unexpectedly, lin-4 to silence their endogenous targets. We will also discuss the roles of the GW182 homologous AIN-1 and AIN-2 proteins in this process."

It was thought that most plant miRNAs act through target transcript cleavage due to the high degree of complementarity between miRNAs and their targets. However, recent studies have suggested widespread translational inhibition by miRNAs in plants. The mechanisms underlining translational inhibition by plant miRNAs are largely unknown, but existing evidence has indicated that plants and animals share some mechanistic similarity of translational inhibition. Translational inhibition by miRNAs has been shown to regulate floral patterning, floral timing, and stress responses. This chapter covers recent progress on plant miRNA-mediated translational control."

We sequenced and analyzed the degradome of the moss Physcomitrella patens, an important model system for functional genomic analyses in plant evolution. A total of 52 target mRNAs of 27 different Physcomitrella miRNA families were identified. Many targets of both more conserved and less conserved miRNA families encoded putative regulatory proteins. Remnants of MIRNA hairpin processing also populated the degradome data and indicated an unusual \"loop-first\" mode of precise processing for the MIR319 gene family. Precise loop-first processing was confirmed for native Physcomitrella, rice, and Arabidopsis MIR319 hairpins, as well as an Arabidopsis artificial MIRNA (aMIRNA) based upon a MIR319 backbone. MIR319 is thus a conserved exception to the general rule of loop-last processing of MIRNA hairpins. Loop-first MIR319 processing may contribute to the high efficacy of a widely used MIR319-based strategy for aMIRNA production in plants."

        "title": "The Arabidopsis thaliana double-stranded RNA binding protein DRB1 directs guide strand selection from microRNA duplexes.",
        "abstract": "In Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis), DICER-LIKE1 (DCL1) functions together with the double-stranded RNA binding protein (dsRBP), DRB1, to process microRNAs (miRNAs) from their precursor transcripts prior to their transfer to the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). miRNA-loaded RISC directs RNA silencing of cognate mRNAs via ARGONAUTE1 (AGO1)-catalyzed cleavage. Short interefering RNAs (siRNAs) are processed from viral-derived or transgene-encoded molecules of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) by the DCL/dsRBP partnership, DCL4/DRB4, and are also loaded to AGO1-catalyzed RISC for cleavage of complementary mRNAs. Here, we use an artificial miRNA (amiRNA) technology, transiently expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana, to produce a series of amiRNA duplexes with differing intermolecular thermostabilities at the 5' end of duplex strands. Analyses of amiRNA duplex strand accumulation and target transcript expression revealed that strand selection (amiRNA and amiRNA*) is directed by asymmetric thermostability of the duplex termini. The duplex strand possessing a lower 5' thermostability was preferentially retained by RISC to guide mRNA cleavage of the corresponding target transgene. In addition, analysis of endogenous miRNA duplex strand accumulation in Arabidopsis drb1 and drb2345 mutant plants revealed that DRB1 dictates strand selection, presumably by directional loading of the miRNA duplex onto RISC for passenger strand degradation. Bioinformatic and Northern blot analyses of DCL4/DRB4-dependent small RNAs (miRNAs and siRNAs) revealed that small RNAs produced by this DCL/dsRBP combination do not conform to the same terminal thermostability rules as those governing DCL1/DRB1-processed miRNAs. This suggests that small RNA processing in the DCL1/DRB1-directed miRNA and DCL4/DRB4-directed sRNA biogenesis pathways operates via different mechanisms."

        "title": "The role of microRNAs in normal and malignant hematopoiesis.",
        "abstract": "MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that act at the post-transcriptional level, regulating protein expression by repressing translation or destabilizing mRNA target. Because of their discovery, microRNAs have been associated with almost every normal cell function, including proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. Several lines of evidence suggest that they have an important role in normal hematopoiesis as exemplified by the role of mir-155 and mir-150 in the differentiation of B and T lymphocytes, the suppressive role of mir-221 and mir-222 in erythroid differentiation, the inhibitory effect of mir-181 on hematopoietic differentiation and the induction of myeloid differentiation by mir-223. Moreover, they play a role both as oncogenes, probably by a variety of mechanisms, namely through elimination of tumor suppressor proteins, or as tumor suppressor genes by targeting oncogenic mRNAs. Their aberrant expression has been associated with solid tumors and hematopoietic malignancies as suggested by the frequent deletion of mir-15a and mir-16-1 in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, the increased levels of mir-155 in diffuse large B-cell lymphomas and the increased levels of mir-181 in acute myeloid leukemia M1 and M2. The purpose of this review is to summarize current knowledge on the role of microRNAs in normal hematopoiesis and hematopoietic malignancies and, moreover, to highlight their role as potential therapeutic tools."

        "title": "MicroRNAs: Oncogenes, tumor suppressors or master regulators of cancer heterogeneity?",
        "abstract": "The realization that microRNAs are intimately linked to cancer pathogenesis has spawned an explosion of research activity in recent years. Their presence is not merely predictive of tumor origin and behavior, they are causally linked to the emergence and development of cancer by acting as oncogenes or tumor suppressors. The understanding of the functional consequences of altered microRNA expression in cancer is progressing rapidly, even though the prediction of microRNA targets is still a hit and miss process. MicroRNAs may not act primarily by strongly reducing the expression of a few prominent cancer-regulatory genes, but by influencing the properties of the network of which these regulators are a central part. By coordinately regulating many genes, microRNAs are exquisitely suited to act as stabilizers of networks and to prevent extreme variations in phenotype due to intrinsic and extrinsic disturbances. Many advanced tumors show defects in microRNA expression and processing, which could increase phenotypic variability within tumors. This allows small subsets of cells with altered characteristics to emerge, which can have grave consequences as typically a small fraction of tumor cells is responsible for metastasis and treatment resistance, and ultimately treatment failure. Investigating microRNAs from the perspective of master regulators of network stability in cancer calls for new experimental approaches and may help to understand causes of cancer heterogeneity and disease progression."

        "abstract": "miR-24, upregulated during terminal differentiation of multiple lineages, inhibits cell-cycle progression. Antagonizing miR-24 restores postmitotic cell proliferation and enhances fibroblast proliferation, whereas overexpressing miR-24 increases the G1 compartment. The 248 mRNAs downregulated upon miR-24 overexpression are highly enriched for DNA repair and cell-cycle regulatory genes that form a direct interaction network with prominent nodes at genes that enhance (MYC, E2F2, CCNB1, and CDC2) or inhibit (p27Kip1 and VHL) cell-cycle progression. miR-24 directly regulates MYC and E2F2 and some genes that they transactivate. Enhanced proliferation from antagonizing miR-24 is abrogated by knocking down E2F2, but not MYC, and cell proliferation, inhibited by miR-24 overexpression, is rescued by miR-24-insensitive E2F2. Therefore, E2F2 is a critical miR-24 target. The E2F2 3'UTR lacks a predicted miR-24 recognition element. In fact, miR-24 regulates expression of E2F2, MYC, AURKB, CCNA2, CDC2, CDK4, and FEN1 by recognizing seedless but highly complementary sequences."

        "abstract": "Over the past several years it has become clear that alterations in the expression of microRNA (miRNA) genes contribute to the pathogenesis of most--if not all--human malignancies. These alterations can be caused by various mechanisms, including deletions, amplifications or mutations involving miRNA loci, epigenetic silencing or the dysregulation of transcription factors that target specific miRNAs. Because malignant cells show dependence on the dysregulated expression of miRNA genes, which in turn control or are controlled by the dysregulation of multiple protein-coding oncogenes or tumour suppressor genes, these small RNAs provide important opportunities for the development of future miRNA-based therapies."

        "abstract": "Posttranscriptional regulation of a variety of mRNAs by small 21- to 24-nucleotide RNAs, notably the microRNAs (miRNAs), is emerging as a novel developmental mechanism. In legumes like the model Medicago truncatula, roots are able to develop a de novo meristem through the symbiotic interaction with nitrogen-fixing rhizobia. We used deep sequencing of small RNAs from root apexes and nodules of M. truncatula to identify 100 novel candidate miRNAs encoded by 265 hairpin precursors. New atypical precursor classes producing only specific 21- and 24-nucleotide small RNAs were found. Statistical analysis on sequencing reads abundance revealed specific miRNA isoforms in a same family showing contrasting expression patterns between nodules and root apexes. The differentially expressed conserved and nonconserved miRNAs may target a large variety of mRNAs. In root nodules, which show diverse cell types ranging from a persistent meristem to a fully differentiated central region, we discovered miRNAs spatially enriched in nodule meristematic tissues, vascular bundles, and bacterial infection zones using in situ hybridization. Spatial regulation of miRNAs may determine specialization of regulatory RNA networks in plant differentiation processes, such as root nodule formation."

We have cloned the C. elegans lin-4 locus by chromosomal walking and transformation rescue. We used the C. elegans clone to isolate the gene from three other Caenorhabditis species; all four Caenorhabditis clones functionally rescue the lin-4 null allele of C. elegans. Comparison of the lin-4 genomic sequence from these four species and site-directed mutagenesis of potential open reading frames indicated that lin-4 does not encode a protein. Two small lin-4 transcripts of approximately 22 and 61 nt were identified in C. elegans and found to contain sequences complementary to a repeated sequence element in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of lin-14 mRNA, suggesting that lin-4 regulates lin-14 translation via an antisense RNA-RNA interaction."

        "abstract": "During C. elegans development, the temporal pattern of many cell lineages is specified by graded activity of the heterochronic gene Lin-14. Here we demonstrate that a temporal gradient in Lin-14 protein is generated posttranscriptionally by multiple elements in the lin-14 3'UTR that are regulated by the heterochronic gene Lin-4. The lin-14 3'UTR is both necessary and sufficient to confer lin-4-mediated posttranscriptional temporal regulation. The function of the lin-14 3'UTR is conserved between C. elegans and C. briggsae. Among the conserved sequences are seven elements that are each complementary to the lin-4 RNAs. A reporter gene bearing three of these elements shows partial temporal gradient activity. These data suggest a molecular mechanism for Lin-14p temporal gradient formation: the lin-4 RNAs base pair to sites in the lin-14 3'UTR to form multiple RNA duplexes that down-regulate lin-14 translation."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, endogenous RNAs that regulate gene expression in plants and animals. In plants, these approximately 21-nucleotide RNAs are processed from stem-loop regions of long primary transcripts by a Dicer-like enzyme and are loaded into silencing complexes, where they generally direct cleavage of complementary mRNAs. Although plant miRNAs have some conserved functions extending beyond development, the importance of miRNA-directed gene regulation during plant development is now particularly clear. Identified in plants less than four years ago, miRNAs are already known to play numerous crucial roles at each major stage of development-typically at the cores of gene regulatory networks, targeting genes that are themselves regulators, such as those encoding transcription factors and F-box proteins."

        "title": "Plant nuclear RNA polymerase IV mediates siRNA and DNA methylation-dependent heterochromatin formation.",
        "abstract": "All eukaryotes have three nuclear DNA-dependent RNA polymerases, namely, Pol I, II, and III. Interestingly, plants have catalytic subunits for a fourth nuclear polymerase, Pol IV. Genetic and biochemical evidence indicates that Pol IV does not functionally overlap with Pol I, II, or III and is nonessential for viability. However, disruption of the Pol IV catalytic subunit genes NRPD1 or NRPD2 inhibits heterochromatin association into chromocenters, coincident with losses in cytosine methylation at pericentromeric 5S gene clusters and AtSN1 retroelements. Loss of CG, CNG, and CNN methylation in Pol IV mutants implicates a partnership between Pol IV and the methyltransferase responsible for RNA-directed de novo methylation. Consistent with this hypothesis, 5S gene and AtSN1 siRNAs are essentially eliminated in Pol IV mutants. The data suggest that Pol IV helps produce siRNAs that target de novo cytosine methylation events required for facultative heterochromatin formation and higher-order heterochromatin associations."

        "abstract": "AU-rich elements (AREs) in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of unstable mRNAs dictate their degradation. An RNAi-based screen performed in Drosophila S2 cells has revealed that Dicer1, Argonaute1 (Ago1) and Ago2, components involved in microRNA (miRNA) processing and function, are required for the rapid decay of mRNA containing AREs of tumor necrosis factor-alpha. The requirement for Dicer in the instability of ARE-containing mRNA (ARE-RNA) was confirmed in HeLa cells. We further observed that miR16, a human miRNA containing an UAAAUAUU sequence that is complementary to the ARE sequence, is required for ARE-RNA turnover. The role of miR16 in ARE-RNA decay is sequence-specific and requires the ARE binding protein tristetraprolin (TTP). TTP does not directly bind to miR16 but interacts through association with Ago/eiF2C family members to complex with miR16 and assists in the targeting of ARE. miRNA targeting of ARE, therefore, appears to be an essential step in ARE-mediated mRNA degradation."

The let-7 miRNA times seam cell terminal differentiation in C. elegans. Here we show that the let-7 family negatively regulates let-60/RAS. Loss of let-60/RAS suppresses let-7, and the let-60/RAS 3'UTR contains multiple let-7 complementary sites (LCSs), restricting reporter gene expression in a let-7-dependent manner. mir-84, a let-7 family member, is largely absent in vulval precursor cell P6.p at the time that let-60/RAS specifies the 1 degrees vulval fate in that cell, and mir-84 overexpression suppresses the multivulva phenotype of activating let-60/RAS mutations. The 3'UTRs of the human RAS genes contain multiple LCSs, allowing let-7 to regulate RAS expression. let-7 expression is lower in lung tumors than in normal lung tissue, while RAS protein is significantly higher in lung tumors, providing a possible mechanism for let-7 in cancer."

        "abstract": "trans-acting siRNAs (ta-siRNAs) are endogenous RNAs that direct the cleavage of complementary mRNA targets . TAS gene transcripts are cleaved by miRNAs; the cleavage products are protected against degradation by SGS3, copied into dsRNA by RDR6, and diced into ta-siRNAs by DCL4 . We describe hypomorphic rdr6 and sgs3 Arabidopsis mutants, which do not exhibit the leaf developmental defects observed in null mutants and which, like null alleles, are impaired in sense-transgene-induced posttranscriptional gene silencing and virus resistance. Null rdr6 and sgs3 mutants lack TAS1, TAS2, and TAS3 ta-siRNAs and overaccumulate ARF3/ETTIN and ARF4 mRNAs, which are TAS3 ta-siRNA targets. A hypomorphic rdr6 mutant accumulates wild-type TAS3 ta-siRNA levels but not TAS1 and TAS2 ta-siRNAs, suggesting that TAS3 is required for proper leaf development. Consistently, tas3 but not tas1 or tas2 mutants exhibits leaf morphology defects, and ago7/zip and drb4 mutants, which exhibit leaf morphology defects, lack TAS3 but not TAS1 and TAS2 ta-siRNAs in leaves. These results indicate that the dsRNA binding protein DRB4 is required for proper ta-siRNA production, presumably by interacting with DCL4, an interaction analogous to that of HYL1 with DCL1 during miRNA production , and that TAS3 ta-siRNAs are required for proper leaf development through the action of AGO7/ZIPPY."

        "abstract": "Plants leaves develop proximodistal, dorsoventral (adaxial-abaxial), and mediolateral patterns following initiation. The Myb domain gene PHANTASTICA (PHAN) is required for adaxial fate in many plants , but the Arabidopsis ortholog ASYMMETRIC LEAVES1 (AS1) has milder effects, suggesting that alternate or redundant pathways exist . We describe enhancers of as1 with more elongate and dissected leaves. As well as RDR6, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase previously proposed to influence as1 through microRNA , these enhancers disrupt ARGONAUTE7 (AGO7)/ZIPPY, SUPPRESSOR OF GENE SILENCING3 (SGS3), and DICER-LIKE4 (DCL4), which instead regulate trans-acting small interfering RNA (ta-siRNA) . Microarray analysis revealed that the AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR genes ETTIN (ETT)/ARF3 and ARF4 were upregulated in ago7, whereas FILAMENTOUS FLOWER (FIL) was upregulated only in as1 ago7 double mutants. RDR6 and SGS3 likewise repress these genes, which specify abaxial fate . We show that the trans-acting siRNA gene TAS3, which targets ETT and ARF4, is expressed in the adaxial domain, and ett as1 ago7 triple mutants resemble as1. Thus FIL is downregulated redundantly by AS1 and by TAS3, acting through ETT, revealing a role for ta-siRNA in leaf polarity. RDR6 and DCL4 are required for systemic silencing, perhaps implicating ta-siRNA as a mobile signal."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) and trans-acting siRNAs (ta-siRNAs) in plants form through distinct pathways, although they function as negative regulators of mRNA targets by similar mechanisms . Three ta-siRNA gene families (TAS1, TAS2, and TAS3) are known in Arabidopsis thaliana. Biogenesis of TAS3 ta-siRNAs, which target mRNAs encoding several AUXIN RESPONSE FACTORs (including ARF3/ETTIN and ARF4 ) involves miR390-guided processing of primary transcripts, conversion of a precursor to dsRNA through RNA-DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASE6 (RDR6) activity, and sequential DICER-LIKE4 (DCL4)-mediated cleavage events. We show that the juvenile-to-adult phase transition is normally suppressed by TAS3 ta-siRNAs, in an ARGONAUTE7-dependent manner, through negative regulation of ARF3 mRNA. Expression of a nontargeted ARF3 mutant (ARF3mut) in a wild-type background reproduced the phase-change phenotypes detected in rdr6-15 and dcl4-2 mutants, which lose all ta-siRNAs. Expression of either ARF3 or ARF3mut in rdr6-15 plants, in which both endogenous and transgenic copies of ARF3 were derepressed, resulted in further acceleration of phase change and severe morphological and patterning defects of leaves and floral organs. In light of the functions of ARF3 and ARF4 in organ asymmetry, these data reveal multiple roles for TAS3 ta-siRNA-mediated regulation of ARF genes in developmental timing and patterning."

        "abstract": "Transfected siRNAs and miRNAs regulate numerous transcripts that have only limited complementarity to the active strand of the RNA duplex. This process reflects natural target regulation by miRNAs, but is an unintended (\"off-target\") consequence of siRNA-mediated silencing. Here we demonstrate that this unintended off-target silencing is widespread, and occurs in a manner reminiscent of target silencing by miRNAs. A high proportion of unintended transcripts silenced by siRNAs showed 3' UTR sequence complementarity to the seed region of the siRNA. Base mismatches within the siRNA seed region reduced the set of original off-target transcripts but generated new sets of silenced transcripts with sequence complementarity to the mismatched seed sequence. An inducible shRNA silenced a subset of transcripts that were silenced by an siRNA of the same sequence, demonstrating that unintended silencing is sequence mediated and is independent of delivery method. In all cases, off-target transcript silencing was accompanied by loss of the corresponding protein and occurred with dependence on siRNA concentration similar to that of silencing of the target transcript. Thus, short stretches of sequence complementarity to the siRNA or shRNA seed region are key to the silencing of unintended transcripts."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNAs that regulate gene expression posttranscriptionally. To block all miRNA formation in zebrafish, we generated maternal-zygotic dicer (MZdicer) mutants that disrupt the Dicer ribonuclease III and double-stranded RNA-binding domains. Mutant embryos do not process precursor miRNAs into mature miRNAs, but injection of preprocessed miRNAs restores gene silencing, indicating that the disrupted domains are dispensable for later steps in silencing. MZdicer mutants undergo axis formation and differentiate multiple cell types but display abnormal morphogenesis during gastrulation, brain formation, somitogenesis, and heart development. Injection of miR-430 miRNAs rescues the brain defects in MZdicer mutants, revealing essential roles for miRNAs during morphogenesis."

        "abstract": "In Caenorhabditis elegans, lin-4 and let-7 encode 22- and 21-nucleotide (nt) RNAs, respectively, which function as key regulators of developmental timing. Because the appearance of these short RNAs is regulated during development, they are also referred to as small temporal RNAs (stRNAs). We show that many 21- and 22-nt expressed RNAs, termed microRNAs, exist in invertebrates and vertebrates and that some of these novel RNAs, similar to let-7 stRNA, are highly conserved. This suggests that sequence-specific, posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms mediated by small RNAs are more general than previously appreciated."

We find that these two regulatory RNAs are members of a large class of 21- to 24-nucleotide noncoding RNAs, called microRNAs (miRNAs). We report on 55 previously unknown miRNAs in C. elegans. The miRNAs have diverse expression patterns during development: a let-7 paralog is temporally coexpressed with let-7; miRNAs encoded in a single genomic cluster are coexpressed during embryogenesis; and still other miRNAs are expressed constitutively throughout development. Potential orthologs of several of these miRNA genes were identified in Drosophila and human genomes. The abundance of these tiny RNAs, their expression patterns, and their evolutionary conservation imply that, as a class, miRNAs have broad regulatory functions in animals."

The RISC-bound small RNA guides the RISC complex to identify and cleave mRNAs with complementary sequences. The proteins that make up the RISC complex and cleave mRNA have not been unequivocally defined. Here, we report the biochemical purification of RISC activity to homogeneity from Drosophila Schnieder 2 cell extracts. Argonaute 2 (Ago-2) is the sole protein component present in the purified, functional RISC. By using a bioinformatics method that combines sequence-profile analysis with predicted protein secondary structure, we found homology between the PIWI domain of Ago-2 and endonuclease V and identified potential active-site amino acid residues within the PIWI domain of Ago-2."

        "title": "AGO1 defines a novel locus of Arabidopsis controlling leaf development.",
        "abstract": "An allelic series of the novel argonaute mutant (ago1-1 to ago1-6) of the herbaceous plant Arabidopsis thaliana has been isolated. The ago1 mutation pleotropically affects general plant architecture. The apical shoot meristem generates rosette leaves and a single stem, but axillary meristems rarely develop. Rosette leaves lack a leaf blade but still show adaxial/abaxial differentiation. Instead of cauline leaves, filamentous structures without adaxial/abaxial differentiation develop along the stem and an abnormal inflorescence bearing infertile flowers with filamentous organs is produced. Two independent T-DNA insertions into the AGO1 locus led to the isolation of two corresponding genomic sequences as well as a complete cDNA. The AGO1 locus was mapped close to the marker mi291a on chromosome 1. Antisense expression of the cDNA resulted in a partial mutant phenotype. Sense expression caused some transgenic lines to develop goblet-like leaves and petals. The cDNA encodes a putative 115 kDa protein with sequence similarity to translation products of a novel gene family present in nematodes as well as humans. No specific function has been assigned to these genes. Similar proteins are not encoded by the genomes of yeast or bacteria, suggesting that AGO1 belongs to a novel class of genes with a function specific to multicellular organisms."

        "abstract": "Arabidopsis thaliana floral meristems are determinate structures that produce a defined number of organs, after which cell division ceases. A new recessive mutant, carpel factory (caf), converts the floral meristems to an indeterminate state. They produce extra whorls of stamens, and an indefinite number of carpels. Thus, CAF appears to suppress cell division in floral meristems. The function of CAF is partially redundant with the function of the CLAVATA (CLV) and SUPERMAN (SUP) genes, as caf clv and caf sup double mutants show dramatically enhanced floral meristem over-proliferation. caf mutant plants also show other defects, including absence of axillary inflorescence meristems, and abnormally shaped leaves and floral organs. The CAF gene was cloned and found to encode a putative protein of 1909 amino acids containing an N-terminal DExH/DEAD-box type RNA helicase domain attached to a C-terminal RNaseIII-like domain. A very similar protein of unknown function is encoded by a fungal and an animal genome. Helicase proteins are involved in a number of processes, including specific mRNA localization and mRNA splicing. RNase III proteins are involved in the processing of rRNA and some mRNA molecules. Thus CAF may act through some type of RNA processing event(s). CAF gives rise to two major transcripts of 2.5 and 6.2 kb. In situ hybridization experiments show that CAF RNA is expressed throughout all shoot tissues."

        "abstract": "In transgenic and nontransgenic plants, viruses are both initiators and targets of a defense mechanism that is similar to posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS). Recently, it was found that potyviruses and cucumoviruses encode pathogenicity determinants that suppress this defense mechanism. Here, we test diverse virus types for the ability to suppress PTGS. Nicotiana benthamiana exhibiting PTGS of a green fluorescent protein transgene were infected with a range of unrelated viruses and various potato virus X vectors producing viral pathogenicity factors. Upon infection, suppression of PTGS was assessed in planta through reactivation of green fluorescence and confirmed by molecular analysis. These experiments led to the identification of three suppressors of PTGS and showed that suppression of PTGS is widely used as a counter-defense strategy by DNA and RNA viruses. However, the spatial pattern and degree of suppression varied extensively between viruses. At one extreme, there are viruses that suppress in all tissues of all infected leaves, whereas others are able to suppress only in the veins of new emerging leaves. This variation existed even between closely related members of the potexvirus group. Collectively, these results suggest that virus-encoded suppressors of gene silencing have distinct modes of action, are targeted against distinct components of the host gene-silencing machinery, and that there is dynamic evolution of the host and viral components associated with the gene-silencing mechanism."

        "abstract": "RNA silencing refers to a broad range of phenomena sharing the common feature that large, double-stranded RNAs or stem-loop precursors are processed to ca. 21-26 nucleotide small RNAs, which then guide the cleavage of cognate RNAs, block productive translation of these RNAs, or induce methylation of specific target DNAs. Although the core mechanisms are evolutionarily conserved, epigenetic maintenance of silencing by amplification of small RNAs and the elaboration of mobile, RNA-based silencing signals occur predominantly in plants. Plant RNA silencing systems are organized into a network with shared components and overlapping functions. MicroRNAs, and probably trans-acting small RNAs, help regulate development at the posttranscriptional level. Small interfering RNAs associated with transgene- and virus-induced silencing function primarily in defending against foreign nucleic acids. Another system, which is concerned with RNA-directed methylation of DNA repeats, seems to have roles in epigenetic silencing of certain transposable elements and genes under their control."

        "title": "Dicing and slicing: the core machinery of the RNA interference pathway.",
        "abstract": "RNA interference (RNAi) is broadly defined as a gene silencing pathway that is triggered by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Many variations have been described on this theme. The dsRNA trigger can be supplied exogenously, as an experimental tool, or can derive from the genome in the form of microRNAs. Gene silencing can be the result of nucleolytic degradation of the mRNA, or by translational suppression. At the heart of the pathway are two ribonuclease machines. The ribonuclease III enzyme Dicer initiates the RNAi pathway by generating the active short interfering RNA trigger. Silencing is effected by the RNA-induced silencing complex and its RNaseH core enzyme Argonaute. This review describes the discovery of these machines and discusses future lines of work on this amazing biochemical pathway."

We studied Slit and Trk-like 1 (SLITRK1) as a candidate gene on chromosome 13q31.1 because of its proximity to a de novo chromosomal inversion in a child with TS. Among 174 unrelated probands, we identified a frameshift mutation and two independent occurrences of the identical variant in the binding site for microRNA hsa-miR-189. These variants were absent from 3600 control chromosomes. SLITRK1 mRNA and hsa-miR-189 showed an overlapping expression pattern in brain regions previously implicated in TS. Wild-type SLITRK1, but not the frameshift mutant, enhanced dendritic growth in primary neuronal cultures. Collectively, these findings support the association of rare SLITRK1 sequence variants with TS."

In fact, miRNAs may regulate as many as one-third of human genes. miRNAs are found only in plants and animals, and in the viruses that infect them. miRNAs function very much like siRNAs, but these two types of small RNAs can be distinguished by their distinct pathways for maturation and by the logic by which they regulate gene expression."

Since the discovery of the first microRNA gene, lin-4, in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, many more of these short regulatory RNA genes have been identified in flowering plants, worms, flies, fish, frogs and mammals. Currently, about 2% of the known human genes encode microRNAs. MicroRNAs are essential for development and this review will summarise our current knowledge of animal microRNA function. We will also discuss the emerging links of microRNA biology to stem cell research and human disease, in particular cancer."

        "abstract": "In plants and in some animals, the effects of post-transcriptional RNA silencing can extend beyond its sites of initiation, owing to the movement of signal molecules. Although the mechanisms and channels involved are different, plant and animal silencing signals must have RNA components that account for the nucleotide sequence-specificity of their effects. Studies carried out in plants and Caenorhabditis elegans have revealed that non-cell autonomous silencing is operated through specialized, remarkably sophisticated pathways and serves important biological functions, including antiviral immunity and, perhaps, developmental patterning. Recent intriguing observations suggest that systemic RNA silencing pathways may also exist in higher vertebrates."

        "abstract": "Argonaute proteins use small RNAs to guide the silencing of complementary target RNAs in many eukaryotes. Although small RNA biogenesis pathways are well studied, mechanisms for removal of guide RNAs from Argonaute are poorly understood. Here we show that the Argonaute2 (Ago2) guide RNA complex is extremely stable, with a half-life on the order of days. However, highly complementary target RNAs destabilize the complex and significantly accelerate release of the guide RNA from Ago2. This \"unloading\" activity can be enhanced by mismatches between the target and the guide 5' end and attenuated by mismatches to the guide 3' end. The introduction of 3' mismatches leads to more potent silencing of abundant mRNAs in mammalian cells. These findings help to explain why the 3' ends of mammalian microRNAs (miRNAs) rarely match their targets, suggest a mechanism for sequence-specific small RNA turnover, and offer insights for controlling small RNAs in mammalian cells."

        "title": "Evidence for nuclear processing of plant micro RNA and short interfering RNA precursors.",
        "abstract": "The Arabidopsis genome encodes four Dicer-like (DCL) proteins, two of which contain putative nuclear localization signals. This suggests one or more nuclear pathways for processing double-stranded (ds) RNA in plants. To study the subcellular location of processing of nuclear-encoded dsRNA involved in transcriptional silencing, we examined short interfering (si) RNA and micro (mi) RNA accumulation in transgenic Arabidopsis expressing nuclear and cytoplasmic variants of P19, a viral protein that suppresses posttranscriptional gene silencing. P19 binds specifically to DCL-generated 21- to 25-nucleotide (nt) dsRNAs with 2-nt 3' overhangs and reportedly suppresses the accumulation of all size classes of siRNA. Nuclear P19 resulted in a significant reduction of 21- to 22-nt siRNAs and a 21-nt miRNA, but had a lesser effect on 24-nt siRNAs. Cytoplasmic P19 did not decrease the quantity but resulted in a 2-nt truncation of siRNAs and miRNA. This suggests that the direct products of DCL cleavage of dsRNA precursors of 21- to 22-nt siRNAs and miRNA are present in the nucleus, where their accumulation is partially repressed, and in the cytoplasm, where both normal sized and truncated forms accumulate. DCL1, which contains two putative nuclear localization signals, is required for miRNA production but not siRNA production. DCL1-green fluorescent protein fusion proteins localize to nuclei in transient expression assays, indicating that DCL1 is a nuclear protein. The results are consistent with a model in which dsRNA precursors of miRNAs and at least some 21- to 22-nt siRNAs are processed in the nucleus, the former by nuclear DCL1 and the latter by an unknown nuclear DCL."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs are non-coding small RNAs that regulate gene expression by Watson-Crick base pairing to target messenger RNA (mRNA). They are involved in most biological and pathological processes, including tumorigenesis. The binding of microRNA to mRNA is critical for regulating the mRNA level and protein expression. However, this binding can be affected by single-nucleotide polymorphisms that can reside in the microRNA target site, which can either abolish existing binding sites or create illegitimate binding sites. Therefore, polymorphisms in microRNA can have a differing effect on gene and protein expression and represent another type of genetic variability that can influence the risk of certain human diseases. Different approaches have been used to predict and identify functional polymorphisms within microRNA-binding sites. The biological relevance of these polymorphisms in predicted microRNA-binding sites is beginning to be examined in large case-control studies."

        "abstract": "High complementarity between plant microRNAs (miRNAs) and their messenger RNA targets is thought to cause silencing, prevalently by endonucleolytic cleavage. We have isolated Arabidopsis mutants defective in miRNA action. Their analysis provides evidence that plant miRNA-guided silencing has a widespread translational inhibitory component that is genetically separable from endonucleolytic cleavage. We further show that the same is true of silencing mediated by small interfering RNA (siRNA) populations. Translational repression is effected in part by the ARGONAUTE proteins AGO1 and AGO10. It also requires the activity of the microtubule-severing enzyme katanin, implicating cytoskeleton dynamics in miRNA action, as recently suggested from animal studies. Also as in animals, the decapping component VARICOSE (VCS)/Ge-1 is required for translational repression by miRNAs, which suggests that the underlying mechanisms in the two kingdoms are related."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are abundant endogenous small RNAs (smRNAs) that control transcript expression through posttranscriptional gene silencing. Here, we show that concomitant loss of XRN4/EIN5, a 5'-3' exoribonuclease, and ABH1/CBP80, a subunit of the mRNA cap binding complex, results in Arabidopsis plants manifesting myriad developmental defects. We find that ABH1/CBP80 is necessary to obtain proper mature miRNA levels, which suggests this protein affects the miRNA-mediated RNA silencing pathway. Additionally, we show that XRN4/EIN5 affects the levels of a smRNA class that is processed from both sense and antisense strands of approximately 130 endogenous transcripts that apparently are converted to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and subsequently processed. We find that the parent transcripts of these smRNAs accumulate in an uncapped form upon loss of XRN4/EIN5, which suggests that uncapped endogenous transcripts can become smRNA biogenesis substrates. Overall, our results reveal unexpected connections between RNA metabolism and silencing pathways."

        "abstract": "Small RNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs) and short interfering RNAs (siRNAs), are key components of an evolutionarily conserved system of RNA-based gene regulation in eukaryotes. They are involved in many molecular interactions, including defense against viruses and regulation of gene expression during development. miRNAs interfere with expression of messenger RNAs encoding factors that control developmental timing, stem cell maintenance, and other developmental and physiological processes in plants and animals. miRNAs are negative regulators that function as specificity determinants, or guides, within complexes that inhibit protein synthesis (animals) or promote degradation (plants) of mRNA targets."

        "title": "The time of appearance of the C. elegans let-7 microRNA is transcriptionally controlled utilizing a temporal regulatory element in its promoter.",
        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a large family of small regulatory RNAs that are poorly understood. The let-7 miRNA regulates the timing of the developmental switch from larval to adult cell fates during Caenorhabditis elegans development. Expression of let-7 RNA is temporally regulated, with robust expression in the fourth larval and adult stages. Here, we show that, like let-7 RNA, a transcriptional fusion of the let-7 promoter to gfp is temporally regulated, indicating that let-7 is transcriptionally controlled. Temporal upregulation of let-7 transcription requires an enhancer element, the temporal regulatory element (TRE), situated about 1200 base pairs upstream of the start of the mature let-7 RNA. The TRE is both necessary and sufficient for this temporal upregulation. A TRE binding factor (TREB) is able to bind to the TRE, and a 22-base pair inverted repeat within the TRE is necessary and sufficient for this binding. We also find that the nuclear hormone receptor DAF-12 and the RNA binding protein LIN-28 are both required for the correct timing of let-7 RNA and let-7::gfp expression. We speculate that these heterochronic genes regulate let-7 expression through its TRE."

Overexpression of miRNA 17-5p-92 cluster in MYCN-not-amplified neuroblastoma cells strongly augments their in vitro and in vivo tumorigenesis. In vitro or in vivo treatment with antagomir-17-5p abolishes the growth of MYCN-amplified and therapy-resistant neuroblastoma through p21 and BIM upmodulation, leading to cell cycling blockade and activation of apoptosis, respectively. In primary neuroblastoma, the majority of cases show a rise of miR-17-5p level leading to p21 downmodulation, which is particularly severe in patients with MYCN amplification and poor prognosis. Altogether, our studies demonstrate for the first time that antagomir treatment can abolish tumor growth in vivo, specifically in therapy-resistant neuroblastoma."

        "abstract": "RNA interference (RNAi) is an evolutionarily conserved, sequence-specific gene-inactivation system that plays an essential role in many biological processes, such as genome defense against mobile DNA elements or regulation of factors involved in plant and animal development. In higher plants and invertebrates, it also functions as a powerful antiviral mechanism. To overcome antiviral RNAi, viruses have evolved suppressor proteins which counteract host RNAi-based antiviral processes and target one or more key points in the RNAi machinery. Here, we review recent progress in our understanding of the mechanism and function of antiviral RNAi in plants and on the viral responses through the expression of silencing suppressor proteins. As a counter-attack RNAi may also regulate innate immunity in plants and contribute to a novel layer of defense against pathogen attack. We also discuss emerging evidence that viruses use RNAi to manipulate host gene expression to modify the cellular environment for the benefit of invading viruses."

Over the last years, many different roles of miRNA mediated regulation in the life cycles of mammalian viruses have been uncovered. In this chapter, I will mainly explore four different examples of how cellular miRNAs interact with viruses: the role of miR-155 in viral oncogenesis, viral strategies to eliminate cellular miR-27, the contribution of miR-122 to the replication of hepatitis C virus, and miRNAs as an experimental tool to control virus replication and vector transgene expression. In the final part of this chapter, I will give a brief overview of virally encoded microRNAs."

Here we show that miRNA miR-10a interacts with the 5' untranslated region of mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins to enhance their translation. miR-10a alleviates translational repression of the ribosomal protein mRNAs during amino acid starvation and is required for their translational induction following anisomycin treatment or overexpression of RAS. We show that miR-10a binds immediately downstream of the regulatory 5'TOP motif and that the 5'TOP regulatory complex and miR-10a are functionally interconnected. The results show that miR-10a may positively control global protein synthesis via the stimulation of ribosomal protein mRNA translation and ribosome biogenesis and hereby affect the ability of cells to undergo transformation."

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression networks necessary for proper development, cell viability and stress responses.

In plants, certain miRNAs indirectly regulate developmental programs by instigating the production of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). In addition, non-cleavable plant miRNA targets sequester miRNAs, thus regulating miRNA availability.

Aberrant miRNA expression has been described for several human malignancies and tumour suppressor functions have been ascribed to this new class of small regulatory RNAs. Accordingly, inactivation due to deletion or mutation has been found in human malignancies. Here, we describe the role of aberrant hypermethylation as an additional mechanism for miRNA gene inactivation in human breast cancer. Aberrant hypermethylation was shown for mir-9-1, mir-124a3, mir-148, mir-152, and mir-663 in 34-86% of cases in a series of 71 primary human breast cancer specimens. For comprehensive methylation analysis, combined bisulphite restriction analysis, bisulphite sequencing, and Pyrosequencing were employed. miRNA gene hypermethylation correlated strongly with methylation of known tumour suppressor genes (p = 0.003). After treatment of various breast cancer cell lines with the demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, reduction of mir-9-1 gene methylation and concomitant reactivation of expression could be observed. For the mir-9-1 gene, which is already hypermethylated in pre-invasive intraductal lesions, a good correlation between quantitative methylation level and reduction of expression could be demonstrated in a subset of primary human breast cancer specimen (r = 0.8). In conclusion, this study demonstrates that various microRNA genes are also affected by epigenetic inactivation due to aberrant hypermethylation and that this is an early and frequent event in breast cancer development."

        "abstract": "Mirtrons are alternative precursors for microRNA biogenesis that were recently described in invertebrates. These short hairpin introns use splicing to bypass Drosha cleavage, which is otherwise essential for the generation of canonical animal microRNAs. Using computational and experimental strategies, we now establish that mammals have mirtrons as well. We identified 3 mirtrons that are well conserved and expressed in diverse mammals, 16 primate-specific mirtrons, and 46 candidates supported by limited cloning evidence in primates. As with some fly and worm mirtrons, the existence of well-conserved mammalian mirtrons indicates their relatively ancient incorporation into endogenous regulatory pathways. However, as worms, flies, and mammals each have different sets of mirtrons, we hypothesize that different animals may have independently evolved the capacity for this hybrid small RNA pathway. This notion is supported by our observation of several clade-specific features of mammalian and invertebrate mirtrons."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important genetic regulators of development, differentiation, growth, and metabolism. The mammalian genome encodes approximately 500 known miRNA genes. Approximately 50% are expressed from non-protein-coding transcripts, whereas the rest are located mostly in the introns of coding genes. Intronic miRNAs are generally transcribed coincidentally with their host genes. However, the nature of the primary transcript of intergenic miRNAs is largely unknown. We have performed a large-scale analysis of transcription start sites, polyadenylation signals, CpG islands, EST data, transcription factor-binding sites, and expression ditag data surrounding intergenic miRNAs in the human genome to improve our understanding of the structure of their primary transcripts. We show that a significant fraction of primary transcripts of intergenic miRNAs are 3-4 kb in length, with clearly defined 5' and 3' boundaries. We provide strong evidence for the complete transcript structure of a small number of human miRNAs."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a recently discovered family of small regulatory molecules that function by modulating protein production. There are approximately 500 known mammalian miRNA genes, and each miRNA may regulate hundreds of different protein-coding genes. Mature miRNAs bind to target mRNAs in a protein complex known as the miRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC), sometimes referred to as the miRNP (miRNA-containing ribonucleoprotein particles), where mRNA translation is inhibited or mRNA is degraded. These actions of miRNAs have been shown to regulate several developmental and physiological processes including stem cell differentiation, haematopoiesis, cardiac and skeletal muscle development, neurogenesis, insulin secretion, cholesterol metabolism and the immune response. Furthermore, aberrant expression has been implicated in a number of diseases including cancer and heart disease. The role of miRNAs in these developmental, physiological and pathological processes will be reviewed."

        "abstract": "Tumor-suppressor Pdcd4 inhibits transformation and invasion and is downregulated in cancers. So far, it has not been studied as to whether miRNAs, suppressing target expression by binding to the 3'-UTR, regulate Pdcd4 or invasion. The present study was conducted to investigate the regulation of Pdcd4, and invasion/intra-vasation, by miRNAs. A bioinformatics search revealed a conserved target-site for miR-21 within the Pdcd4-3'-UTR at 228-249 nt. In 10 colorectal cell lines, an inverse correlation of miR-21 and Pdcd4-protein was observed. Transfection of Colo206f-cells with miR-21 significantly suppressed a luciferase-reporter containing the Pdcd4-3'-UTR, whereas transfection of RKO with anti-miR-21 increased activity of this construct. This was abolished when a construct mutated at the miR-21/nt228-249 target site was used instead. Anti-miR-21-transfected RKO cells showed an increase of Pdcd4-protein and reduced invasion. Moreover, these cells showed reduced intra-vasation and lung metastasis in a chicken-embryo-metastasis assay. In contrast, overexpression of miR-21 in Colo206f significantly reduced Pdcd4-protein amounts and increased invasion, while Pdcd4-mRNA was unaltered. Resected normal/tumor tissues of 22 colorectal cancer patients demonstrated an inverse correlation between miR-21 and Pdcd4-protein. This is the first study to show that Pdcd4 is negatively regulated by miR-21. Furthermore, it is the first report to demonstrate that miR-21 induces invasion/intravasation/metastasis."

        "abstract": "Although the cellular concentration of miRNAs is critical to their function, how miRNA expression and abundance are regulated during ontogeny is unclear. We applied miRNA-, mRNA-, and ChIP-Seq to characterize the microRNome during lymphopoiesis within the context of the transcriptome and epigenome. We show that lymphocyte-specific miRNAs are either tightly controlled by polycomb group-mediated H3K27me3 or maintained in a semi-activated epigenetic state prior to full expression. Because of miRNA biogenesis, the cellular concentration of mature miRNAs does not typically reflect transcriptional changes. However, we uncover a subset of miRNAs for which abundance is dictated by miRNA gene expression. We confirm that concentration of 5p and 3p miRNA strands depends largely on free energy properties of miRNA duplexes. Unexpectedly, we also find that miRNA strand accumulation can be developmentally regulated. Our data provide a comprehensive map of immunity's microRNome and reveal the underlying epigenetic and transcriptional forces that shape miRNA homeostasis."

        "abstract": "Small silencing RNAs--small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) or microRNAs (miRNAs)--direct posttranscriptional gene silencing of their mRNA targets as guides for the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). Both siRNAs and miRNAs are born double stranded. Surprisingly, loading these small RNA duplexes into Argonaute proteins, the core components of RISC, requires ATP, whereas separating the two small RNA strands within Argonaute does not. Here we show that the Hsc70/Hsp90 chaperone machinery is required to load small RNA duplexes into Argonaute proteins, but not for subsequent strand separation or target cleavage. We envision that the chaperone machinery uses ATP and mediates a conformational opening of Ago proteins so that they can receive bulky small RNA duplexes. Our data suggest that the chaperone machinery may serve as the driving force for the RISC assembly pathway."

        "abstract": "RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISCs) play central roles in posttranscriptional gene silencing. In plants, the mechanism of RISC assembly has remained elusive due to the lack of cell-free systems that recapitulate the process. In this report, we demonstrate that plant AGO1 protein synthesized by in vitro translation using an extract of evacuolated tobacco protoplasts incorporates synthetic small interfering RNA (siRNA) and microRNA (miRNA) duplexes to form RISCs that sequester the single-stranded siRNA guide strand and miRNA strand, respectively. The formed RISCs were able to recognize and cleave the complementary target RNAs. In this system, the siRNA duplex was incorporated into HSP90-bound AGO1, and subsequent removal of the passenger strand was triggered by ATP hydrolysis by HSP90. Removal of the siRNA passenger strand required the ribonuclease activity of AGO1, while that of the miRNA star strand did not. Based on these results, the mechanism of plant RISC formation is discussed."

Alterations of miRNA expression and function contribute to both physiological and pathological processes such as development and cancer. While their roles have been attracting more attention in connection with tumor development, the mechanisms regulating miRNA biogenesis have not been well understood. Accumulating evidences have revealed the dynamic regulation of miRNA biosynthesis by several regulatory factors and demonstrated the complexity of miRNA-mediated gene regulation. In addition, several reports showed the interplay between the p53 tumor suppressor network and the miRNA-mediated gene regulatory system. We recently found that p53 modulates miRNA maturation at the processing step of primary miRNA transcripts, unraveling a novel function of p53. Here, we review the recent understanding of functional links between miRNA biogenesis and intracellular signaling pathways, with particular focus on the crosstalk between the p53 network and the miRNA biogenesis machinery. Further characterization of controlling elements for miRNA production and activity would provide important insights for a comprehensive understanding of the miRNA function in health and disease."

Here, we present \"centered sites,\" a class of miRNA target sites that lack both perfect seed pairing and 3'-compensatory pairing and instead have 11-12 contiguous Watson-Crick pairs to the center of the miRNA. Although centered sites can impart mRNA cleavage in vitro (in elevated Mg(2+)), in cells they repress protein output without consequential Argonaute-catalyzed cleavage. Our study also identified extensively paired sites that are cleavage substrates in cultured cells and human brain. This expanded repertoire of cleavage targets and the identification of the centered site type help explain why central regions of many miRNAs are evolutionarily conserved."

        "abstract": "Embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells are characterized by their ability to self-renew and differentiate into any cell type. The molecular mechanism behind this process is a complex interplay between the transcriptional factors with epigenetic regulators and signaling pathways. miRNAs are an integral part of this regulatory network, with essential roles in pluripotent maintenance, proliferation and differentiation. miRNAs are a class of small noncoding RNAs that target protein-encoding mRNA to inhibit translation and protein synthesis. Discovered close to 20 years ago, miRNAs have rapidly emerged as key regulatory molecules in several critical cellular processes across species. Recent studies have begun to clarify the specific role of miRNA in regulatory circuitries that control self-renewal and pluripotency of both embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells. These advances suggest a critical role for miRNAs in the process of reprogramming somatic cells to pluripotent cells."

        "abstract": "The bidentate RNase III Dicer cleaves microRNA precursors to generate the 21-23 nt long mature RNAs. These precursors are 60-80 nt long, they fold into a characteristic stem-loop structure and they are generated by an unknown mechanism. To gain insights into the biogenesis of microRNAs, we have characterized the precise 5' and 3' ends of the let-7 precursors in human cells. We show that they harbor a 5'-phosphate and a 3'-OH and that, remarkably, they contain a 1-4 nt 3' overhang. These features are characteristic of RNase III cleavage products. Since these precursors are present in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm of human cells, our results suggest that they are generated in the nucleus by the nuclear RNase III. Additionally, these precursors fit the minihelix export motif and are thus likely exported by this pathway."

        "title": "Structure and nucleic-acid binding of the Drosophila Argonaute 2 PAZ domain.",
        "abstract": "RNA interference is a conserved mechanism that regulates gene expression in response to the presence of double-stranded (ds)RNAs. The RNase III-like enzyme Dicer first cleaves dsRNA into 21-23-nucleotide small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). In the effector step, the multimeric RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) identifies messenger RNAs homologous to the siRNAs and promotes their degradation. The Argonaute 2 protein (Ago2) is a critical component of RISC. Both Argonaute and Dicer family proteins contain a common PAZ domain whose function is unknown. Here we present the three-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance structure of the Drosophila melanogaster Ago2 PAZ domain. This domain adopts a nucleic-acid-binding fold that is stabilized by conserved hydrophobic residues. The nucleic-acid-binding patch is located in a cleft between the surface of a central beta-barrel and a conserved module comprising strands beta3, beta4 and helix alpha3. Because critical structural residues and the binding surface are conserved, we suggest that PAZ domains in all members of the Argonaute and Dicer families adopt a similar fold with nucleic-acid binding function, and that this plays an important part in gene silencing."

        "abstract": "The discovery of RNA-mediated gene-silencing pathways, including RNA interference, highlights a fundamental role of short RNAs in eukaryotic gene regulation and antiviral defence. Members of the Dicer and Argonaute protein families are essential components of these RNA-silencing pathways. Notably, these two families possess an evolutionarily conserved PAZ (Piwi/Argonaute/Zwille) domain whose biochemical function is unknown. Here we report the nuclear magnetic resonance solution structure of the PAZ domain from Drosophila melanogaster Argonaute 1 (Ago1). The structure consists of a left-handed, six-stranded beta-barrel capped at one end by two alpha-helices and wrapped on one side by a distinctive appendage, which comprises a long beta-hairpin and a short alpha-helix. Using structural and biochemical analyses, we demonstrate that the PAZ domain binds a 5-nucleotide RNA with 1:1 stoichiometry. We map the RNA-binding surface to the open face of the beta-barrel, which contains amino acids conserved within the PAZ domain family, and we define the 5'-to-3' orientation of single-stranded RNA bound within that site. Furthermore, we show that PAZ domains from different human Argonaute proteins also bind RNA, establishing a conserved function for this domain."

Key RISC components are Argonaute proteins, which contain two characteristic domains, PAZ and PIWI. PAZ is highly conserved and is found only in Argonaute proteins and Dicer. We have solved the crystal structure of the PAZ domain of Drosophila Argonaute2. The PAZ domain contains a variant of the OB fold, a module that often binds single-stranded nucleic acids. PAZ domains show low-affinity nucleic acid binding, probably interacting with the 3' ends of single-stranded regions of RNA. PAZ can bind the characteristic two-base 3' overhangs of siRNAs, indicating that although PAZ may not be a primary nucleic acid binding site in Dicer or RISC, it may contribute to the specific and productive incorporation of siRNAs and miRNAs into the RNAi pathway."

        "abstract": "Transposable elements are stretches of DNA that can move and multiply within the genome of an organism. The Caenorhabditis elegans genome contains multiple Tc1 transposons that jump in somatic cells, but are silenced in the germ line. Many mutants that have lost this silencing have also lost the ability to execute RNA interference (RNAi), a process whereby genes are suppressed by exposure to homologous double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Here we show how RNAi causes transposon silencing in the nematode germ line. We find evidence for transposon-derived dsRNAs, in particular to the terminal inverted repeats, and show that these RNAs may derive from read-through transcription of entire transposable elements. Small interfering RNAs of Tc1 were detected. When a germline-expressed reporter gene is fused to a stretch of Tc1 sequence, this transgene is silenced in a manner dependent on functional mutator genes (mut-7, mut-16 and pk732). These results indicate that RNAi surveillance is triggered by fortuitous read-through transcription of dispersed Tc1 copies, which can form dsRNA as a result of 'snap-back' of the terminal inverted repeats. RNAi mediated by this dsRNA silences transposase gene expression."

We show that Exportin-5 (Exp5) mediates efficient nuclear export of short miRNA precursors (pre-miRNAs) and that its depletion by RNA interference results in reduced miRNA levels. Exp5 binds correctly processed pre-miRNAs directly and specifically, in a Ran guanosine triphosphate-dependent manner, but interacts only weakly with extended pre-miRNAs that yield incorrect miRNAs when processed by Dicer in vitro. Thus, Exp5 is key to miRNA biogenesis and may help coordinate nuclear and cytoplasmic processing steps."

Their regulatory roles make miRNAs crucial for normal development and physiology in several distinct groups of eukaryotes including plants and animals. The common notion in the field is that miRNAs have evolved independently in those distinct lineages, but recent evidence from non-bilaterian metazoans, plants, as well as various algae raise the possibility that already the last common ancestor of these lineages might have employed a miRNA pathway for post-transcriptional regulation. In this review we present the commonalities and differences of the miRNA pathways in various eukaryotes and discuss the contrasting scenarios of their possible evolutionary origin and their proposed link to organismal complexity and multicellularity."

The 3'UTR of lin-28 contains a conserved element that is complementary to the 22 nt regulatory RNA product of lin-4 and that resembles seven such elements in the 3'UTR of the heterochronic gene lin-14. Both lin-4 activity and the lin-4-complementary element (LCE) are necessary for stage-specific regulation of lin-28.

        "title": "miR-9, a MYC/MYCN-activated microRNA, regulates E-cadherin and cancer metastasis.",
        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are increasingly implicated in regulating the malignant progression of cancer. Here we show that miR-9, which is upregulated in breast cancer cells, directly targets CDH1, the E-cadherin-encoding messenger RNA, leading to increased cell motility and invasiveness. miR-9-mediated E-cadherin downregulation results in the activation of beta-catenin signalling, which contributes to upregulated expression of the gene encoding vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF); this leads, in turn, to increased tumour angiogenesis. Overexpression of miR-9 in otherwise non-metastatic breast tumour cells enables these cells to form pulmonary micrometastases in mice. Conversely, inhibiting miR-9 by using a 'miRNA sponge' in highly malignant cells inhibits metastasis formation. Expression of miR-9 is activated by MYC and MYCN, both of which directly bind to the mir-9-3 locus. Significantly, in human cancers, miR-9 levels correlate with MYCN amplification, tumour grade and metastatic status. These findings uncover a regulatory and signalling pathway involving a metastasis-promoting miRNA that is predicted to directly target expression of the key metastasis-suppressing protein E-cadherin."

As crucial post-transcriptional regulators, miRNAs are involved in comprehensive biological processes such as developmental timing, cell proliferation and differentiation, oncogenesis and viral defenses. In addition to the roles in ontogenic physiology, researches on the area of miRNA phylogenetic conservation and diversity suggested that miRNAs play important roles in animal evolution through driving phenotypic variations in development. It has been postulated that miRNAs have enormous impacts on phenotypic variation and developmental complexity. Here we reviewed recent advances in the studies on the roles of miRNA in animal evolution, from aspects of the rate of miRNA evolution, the spatio-temporal expression pattern, the variation of target sites, and miRNA gene dynamics. We gave evidence to support the hypothesis that innovations in miRNA-mediated regulations drive the increase of metazoan complexity."

        "title": "The microRNA miR-124 controls gene expression in the sensory nervous system of Caenorhabditis elegans.",
        "abstract": "miR-124 is a highly conserved microRNA (miRNA) whose in vivo function is poorly understood. Here, we identify miR-124 targets based on the analysis of the first mir-124 mutant in any organism. We find that miR-124 is expressed in many sensory neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans and onset of expression coincides with neuronal morphogenesis. We analyzed the transcriptome of miR-124 expressing and nonexpressing cells from wild-type and mir-124 mutants. We observe that many targets are co-expressed with and actively repressed by miR-124. These targets are expressed at reduced relative levels in sensory neurons compared to the rest of the animal. Our data from mir-124 mutant animals show that this effect is due to a large extent to the activity of miR-124. Genes with nonconserved target sites show reduced absolute expression levels in sensory neurons. In contrast, absolute expression levels of genes with conserved sites are comparable to control genes, suggesting a tuning function for many of these targets. We conclude that miR-124 contributes to defining cell-type-specific gene activity by repressing a diverse set of co-expressed genes."

        "abstract": "In recent years, various RNA-based technologies have been under evaluation as potential next-generation cancer therapeutics. Micrornas (miRNAS), known to regulate the cell cycle and development, are deregulated in various cancers. Thus, they might serve as good targets or candidates in an exploration of anticancer therapeutics. One attractive candidate for this purpose is let-7 (\"lethal-7\"). Let-7 is underexpressed in various cancers, and restoration of its normal expression is found to inhibit cancer growth by targeting various oncogenes and inhibiting key regulators of several mitogenic pathways. In vivo, let-7 administration was found effective against mouse-model lung and breast cancers, and our computational prediction supports the possible effectiveness of let-7 in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive metastatic breast cancer. Data also suggest that let-7 regulates apoptosis and cancer stem cell (CSC) differentiation and can therefore be tested as a potential therapeutic in cancer treatment. However, the exact role of let-7 in cancer is not yet fully understood. There is a need to understand the causative molecular basis of let-7 alterations in cancer and to develop proper delivery systems before proceeding to therapeutic applications. This article attempts to highlight certain critical aspects of let-7's therapeutic potential in cancer."

        "title": "Human tRNA-derived small RNAs in the global regulation of RNA silencing.",
        "abstract": "Competition between mammalian RNAi-related gene silencing pathways is well documented. It is therefore important to identify all classes of small RNAs to determine their relationship with RNAi and how they affect each other functionally. Here, we identify two types of 5'-phosphate, 3'-hydroxylated human tRNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNAs). tsRNAs differ from microRNAs in being essentially restricted to the cytoplasm and in associating with Argonaute proteins, but not MOV10. The first type belongs to a previously predicted Dicer-dependent class of small RNAs that we find can modestly down-regulate target genes in trans. The 5' end of type II tsRNA was generated by RNaseZ cleavage downstream from a tRNA gene, while the 3' end resulted from transcription termination by RNA polymerase III. Consistent with their preferential association with the nonslicing Argonautes 3 and 4, canonical gene silencing activity was not observed for type II tsRNAs. The addition, however, of an oligonucleotide that was sense to the reporter gene, but antisense to an overexpressed version of the type II tsRNA, triggered robust, >80% gene silencing. This correlated with the redirection of the thus reconstituted fully duplexed double-stranded RNA into Argonaute 2, whereas Argonautes 3 and 4 were skewed toward less structured small RNAs, particularly single-strand RNAs. We observed that the modulation of tsRNA levels had minor effects on the abundance of microRNAs, but more pronounced changes in the silencing activities of both microRNAs and siRNAs. These findings support that tsRNAs are involved in the global control of small RNA silencing through differential Argonaute association, suggesting that small RNA-mediated gene regulation may be even more finely regulated than previously realized."

        "abstract": "Plants respond to virus infections by activation of RNA-based silencing, which limits infection at both the single-cell and system levels. Viruses encode RNA silencing suppressor proteins that interfere with this response. Wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana is immune to silencing suppressor (HC-Pro)-deficient Turnip mosaic virus, but immunity was lost in the absence of DICER-LIKE proteins DCL4 and DCL2. Systematic analysis of susceptibility and small RNA formation in Arabidopsis mutants lacking combinations of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDR) and DCL proteins revealed that the vast majority of virus-derived small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were dependent on DCL4 and RDR1, although full antiviral defense also required DCL2 and RDR6. Among the DCLs, DCL4 was sufficient for antiviral silencing in inoculated leaves, but DCL2 and DCL4 were both involved in silencing in systemic tissues (inflorescences). Basal levels of antiviral RNA silencing and siRNA biogenesis were detected in mutants lacking RDR1, RDR2, and RDR6, indicating an alternate route to form double-stranded RNA that does not depend on the three previously characterized RDR proteins."

        "abstract": "Despite their widespread roles as regulators of gene expression, important questions remain about target regulation by microRNAs. Animal microRNAs were originally thought to repress target translation, with little or no influence on mRNA abundance, whereas the reverse was thought to be true in plants. Now, however, it is clear that microRNAs can induce mRNA degradation in animals and, conversely, translational repression in plants. Recent studies have made important advances in elucidating the relative contributions of these two different modes of target regulation by microRNAs. They have also shed light on the specific mechanisms of target silencing, which, although it differs fundamentally between plants and animals, shares some common features between the two kingdoms."

We have identified endogenous miRNA binding sites in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), by performing photo-cross-linking immunoprecipitation using antibodies to Argonaute (Ago2) followed by deep sequencing of RNAs (CLIP-seq). We also performed CLIP-seq in Dicer\u207b/\u207b mESCs that lack mature miRNAs, allowing us to define whether the association of Ago2 with the identified sites was miRNA dependent. A significantly enriched motif, GCACUU, was identified only in wild-type mESCs in 3' untranslated and coding regions. This motif matches the seed of a miRNA family that constitutes ~68% of the mESC miRNA population. Unexpectedly, a G-rich motif was enriched in sequences cross-linked to Ago2 in both the presence and absence of miRNAs. Expression analysis and reporter assays confirmed that the seed-related motif confers miRNA-directed regulation on host mRNAs and that the G-rich motif can modulate this regulation."

        "abstract": "Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are diverse natural and synthetic chemicals that may alter various mechanisms of the endocrine system and produce adverse developmental, reproductive, metabolic, and neurological effects in both humans and wildlife. Research on EDCs has revealed that they use a variety of both nuclear receptor-mediated and non-receptor-mediated mechanisms to modulate different components of the endocrine system. The molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of EDCs are still under investigation. Interestingly, some of the effects of EDCs have been observed to pass on to subsequent unexposed generations, which can be explained by the gametic transmission of deregulated epigenetic marks. Epigenetics is the study of heritable changes in gene expression that occur without a change in the DNA sequence. Epigenetic mechanisms, including histone modifications, DNA methylation, and specific micro-RNAs (miRNAs) expression, have been proposed to mediate transgenerational transmission and can be triggered by environmental factors. MiRNAs are short non-coding RNA molecules that post-transcriptionally repress the expression of genes by binding to 3'-untranslated regions of the target mRNAs. Given that there is mounting evidence that miRNAs are regulated by hormones, then clearly it is important to investigate the potential for environmental EDCs to deregulate miRNA expression and action."

Here we report the 3.2 \u00c5 crystal structure of Kluyveromyces polysporus Argonaute (KpAGO) fortuitously complexed with guide RNA originating from small-RNA duplexes autonomously loaded by recombinant KpAGO. Despite their diverse sequences, guide-RNA nucleotides 1-8 are positioned similarly, with sequence-independent contacts to bases, phosphates and 2'-hydroxyl groups pre-organizing the backbone of nucleotides 2-8 in a near-A-form conformation. Compared with prokaryotic Argonautes, KpAGO has numerous surface-exposed insertion segments, with a cluster of conserved insertions repositioning the N domain to enable full propagation of guide-target pairing. Compared with Argonautes in inactive conformations, KpAGO has a hydrogen-bond network that stabilizes an expanded and repositioned loop, which inserts an invariant glutamate into the catalytic pocket. Mutation analyses and analogies to ribonuclease H indicate that insertion of this glutamate finger completes a universally conserved catalytic tetrad, thereby activating Argonaute for RNA cleavage."

MicroRNAs encoded by distinct genes regulate the expression of about 30-60\u00a0% of human protein coding genes by targeting their messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and induce mostly posttranscriptional inhibition, or in some cases enhancement. MicroRNAs, as fine regulators of the gene expression, have important roles in development, the physiological functioning of the organism, e.g. organogenesis, immune functioning, vascular system, etc. The deregulation of microRNA expression has been observed in many disorders, such as in carcinogenesis. Given their tissue specificity and stability, and specific disease-related alterations, tissue microRNAs can be exploited as excellent biomarkers in the diagnosis. Moreover, microRNAs might also be envisaged as novel therapeutic targets. Beside tissue microRNAs, novel data show that microRNAs are also present in body fluids that could further extend their diagnostic utility as minimally invasive biomarkers of various diseases, but also raises intriguing questions regarding their biological relevance. In this introductory chapter, we summarise the most relevant features of microRNAs including their biogenesis, action, the biological, pathological, diagnostic and potential therapeutical relevance of tissue microRNAs."

        "abstract": "ARGONAUTE (AGO) proteins are integral players in all known small RNA-directed regulatory pathways. Eukaryotes produce numerous types of small RNAs, such as microRNAs (miRNA), small interfering RNAs (siRNA), PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), scanRNAs and 21U-RNAs, and these RNA species associate with different types of AGO family members, such as AGO, PIWI and group 3 proteins. Small RNA-guided AGO proteins regulate gene expression at various levels, including internal genomic DNA sequence elimination (in ciliates), translational repression (animals), and RNA cleavage (all eukaryotes), which in some cases is followed by DNA methylation and chromatin remodeling. The plant model species Arabidopsis contains ten AGO proteins belonging to three phylogenetic clades. This review covers our current knowledge of plant AGO functions during miRNA- and siRNA-mediated regulation of development and stress responses, siRNA-mediated antiviral immune response, and siRNA-mediated regulation of chromatin structure and transposons."

        "abstract": "Small RNAs triggering RNA silencing are loaded onto Argonautes and then sequence-specifically guide them to target transcripts. Epitope-tagged human Argonautes (hAgo1, hAgo2, hAgo3, and hAgo4) are associated with siRNAs and miRNAs, but only epitope-tagged hAgo2 has been shown to have Slicer activity. Contrarily, how endogenous hAgos behave with respect to small RNA association and target RNA destruction has remained unclear. Here, we produced monoclonal antibodies for individual hAgos. High-throughput pyrosequencing revealed that immunopurified endogenous hAgo2 and hAgo3 associated mostly with miRNAs. Endogenous hAgo3 did not show Slicer function but localized in P-bodies, suggesting that hAgo3 endogenously expressed is, like hAgo2, involved in the miRNA pathway but antagonizes the RNAi activity of hAgo2. Sequence variations of miRNAs were found at both 5' and 3' ends, suggesting that multiple mature miRNAs containing different \"seed\" sequences can arise from one miRNA precursor. The hAgo antibodies we raised are valuable tools for ascertaining the functional behavior of endogenous Argonautes and miRNAs in RNA silencing."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNA, miR) are negative regulators of gene expression that play an important role in diverse biological processes such as development, cell growth, apoptosis and haematopoiesis, suggesting their association with cancer. Here we analysed the expression signatures of 157 miRNAs in 58 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), 46 follicular lymphoma (FL) and seven non-neoplastic lymph nodes (LN). Comparison of the possible combinations of DLBCL-, FL- and LN resulted in specific DLBCL- and FL-signatures, which include miRNAs with previously published function in haematopoiesis (MIRN150 and MIRN155) or tumour development (MIRN210, MIRN10A, MIRN17-5P and MIRN145). As compared to LN, some miRNAs are differentially regulated in both lymphoma types (MIRN155, MIRN210, MIRN106A, MIRN149 and MIRN139). Conversely, some miRNAs show lymphoma-specific aberrant expression, such as MIRN9/9*, MIRN301, MIRN338 and MIRN213 in FL and MIRN150, MIRN17-5P, MIRN145, MIRN328 and others in DLBCL. A classification tree was computed using four miRNAs (MIRN330, MIRN17-5P, MIRN106a and MIRN210) to correctly identify 98% of all 111 cases that were analysed in this study. Finally, eight miRNAs were found to correlate with event-free and overall survival in DLBCL including known tumour suppressors (MIRN21, MIRN127 and MIRN34a) and oncogenes (MIRN195 and MIRNLET7G)."

        "abstract": "The mammalian genome contains several hundred microRNAs that regulate gene expression through modulation of target mRNAs. Here, we report a fragile chromosomal region lost in specific hematopoietic malignancies. This 7 Mb region encodes about 12% of all genomic microRNAs, including miR-203. This microRNA is additionally hypermethylated in several hematopoietic tumors, including chronic myelogenous leukemias and some acute lymphoblastic leukemias. A putative miR-203 target, ABL1, is specifically activated in these hematopoietic malignancies in some cases as a BCR-ABL1 fusion protein (Philadelphia chromosome). Re-expression of miR-203 reduces ABL1 and BCR-ABL1 fusion protein levels and inhibits tumor cell proliferation in an ABL1-dependent manner. Thus, miR-203 functions as a tumor suppressor, and re-expression of this microRNA might have therapeutic benefits in specific hematopoietic malignancies."

Whereas conventional methods rely on computational prediction and subsequent experimental validation of target RNAs, we directly sequenced >28,000,000 signatures from the 5' ends of polyadenylated products of miRNA-mediated mRNA decay, isolated from inflorescence tissue of Arabidopsis thaliana, to discover novel miRNA-target RNA pairs. Within the set of approximately 27,000 transcripts included in the 8,000,000 nonredundant signatures, several previously predicted but nonvalidated targets of miRNAs were found. Like validated targets, most showed a single abundant signature at the miRNA cleavage site, particularly in libraries from a mutant deficient in the 5'-to-3' exonuclease AtXRN4. Although miRNAs in Arabidopsis have been extensively investigated, working in reverse from the cleaved targets resulted in the identification and validation of novel miRNAs. This versatile approach will affect the study of other aspects of RNA processing beyond miRNA-target RNA pairs."

        "abstract": "Many viruses encode or subvert cellular microRNAs (miRNAs) to aid in their gene expression, amplification strategies, or pathogenic signatures. miRNAs typically downregulate gene expression by binding to the 3' untranslated region of their mRNA targets. As a result, target mRNAs are translationally repressed and subsequently deadenylated and degraded. Curiously, hepatitis C virus (HCV), a member of the Flaviviridae family, recruits two molecules of liver-specific microRNA-122 (miR-122) to the 5' end of its genome. In contrast to the canonical activity of miRNAs, the interactions of miR-122 with the viral genome promote viral RNA accumulation in cultured cells and in animal models of HCV infection. Sequestration of miR-122 results in loss of viral RNA both in cell culture and in the livers of chronic HCV-infected patients. This review discusses the mechanisms by which miR-122 is thought to enhance viral RNA abundance and the consequences of miR-122-HCV interactions. We also describe preliminary findings from phase II clinical trials in patients treated with miR-122 antisense oligonucleotides."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are ubiquitous gene regulators that modulate essential cellular processes at the post-transcriptional level. In metazoans and their viruses, most miRNAs are produced from hairpin-containing primary transcripts that are sequentially cleaved by nuclear Drosha and cytoplasmic Dicer. In the last decade, alternative mechanisms that bypass either the Drosha or Dicer cleavage step have emerged, increasing the complexity of the miRNA regulatory network. Here, we highlight non-canonical pathways that generate miRNAs using a variety of molecular machineries that play fundamental roles in the biogenesis and processing of other classes of cellular RNAs."

        "abstract": "Regulation of several biological functions in plants has now been known to involve diverse RNA silencing pathways. These vital pathways involve various components such as dsRNA, Dicer, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and Argonaute proteins, which lead to the production of several small RNAs (sRNAs) varying in their sizes. These sRNAs have significant role in the regulation of gene expression at transcriptional and translational levels. Among them, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs; majorly 21, 22 and 24 nt) have been shown to play an important role in plants' resistance against many viruses by inhibiting the viral gene expression. Furthermore, it has also been highlighted that siRNA-mediated methylation of viral DNA confers resistance to various plant DNA viruses. In this review, we have outlined the recent advances made using the siRNA-mediated antiviral strategy, along with methylation-based epigenetic defensive mechanisms as a protective measure against diverse plant viruses."

Non-coding RNA transcripts likely outnumber the group of protein coding sequences and hold promise of many new discoveries and mechanistic explanations for essential biological phenomena and pathologies. The best characterized non-coding RNA family consists in humans of about 1400 microRNAs for which abundant evidence have demonstrated fundamental importance in normal development, differentiation, growth control and in human diseases such as cancer. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge and concepts concerning the involvement of microRNAs in cancer, which have emerged from the study of cell culture and animal model systems, including the regulation of key cancer-related pathways, such as cell cycle control and the DNA damage response. Importantly, microRNA molecules are already entering the clinic as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for patient stratification and also as therapeutic targets and agents."

        "title": "Roles of plant small RNAs in biotic stress responses.",
        "abstract": "A multitude of small RNAs (sRNAs, 18-25 nt in length) accumulate in plant tissues. Although heterogeneous in size, sequence, genomic distribution, biogenesis, and action, most of these molecules mediate repressive gene regulation through RNA silencing. Besides their roles in developmental patterning and maintenance of genome integrity, sRNAs are also integral components of plant responses to adverse environmental conditions, including biotic stress. Until recently, antiviral RNA silencing was considered a paradigm of the interactions linking RNA silencing to pathogens: Virus-derived sRNAs silence viral gene expression and, accordingly, viruses produce suppressor proteins that target the silencing mechanism. However, increasing evidence shows that endogenous, rather than pathogen-derived, sRNAs also have broad functions in regulating plant responses to various microbes. In turn, microbes have evolved ways to inhibit, avoid, or usurp cellular silencing pathways, thereby prompting the deployment of counter-defensive measures by plants, a compelling illustration of the never-ending molecular arms race between hosts and parasites."

        "abstract": "RNA silencing is a common strategy shared by eukaryotic organisms to regulate gene expression, and also operates as a defense mechanism against invasive nucleic acids such as viral transcripts. The silencing pathway is quite sophisticated in higher eukaryotes but the distinct steps and nature of effector complexes vary between and even within species. To counteract this defense mechanism viruses have evolved the ability to encode proteins that suppress silencing to protect their genomes from degradation. This review focuses on our current understanding of how individual components of the plant RNA silencing mechanism are directed against viruses, and how in turn virus-encoded suppressors target one or more key events in the silencing cascade."

        "abstract": "Therapeutic strategies based on modulation of microRNA (miRNA) activity hold great promise due to the ability of these small RNAs to potently influence cellular behavior. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of a miRNA replacement therapy for liver cancer. We demonstrate that hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells exhibit reduced expression of miR-26a, a miRNA that is normally expressed at high levels in diverse tissues. Expression of this miRNA in liver cancer cells in vitro induces cell-cycle arrest associated with direct targeting of cyclins D2 and E2. Systemic administration of this miRNA in a mouse model of HCC using adeno-associated virus (AAV) results in inhibition of cancer cell proliferation, induction of tumor-specific apoptosis, and dramatic protection from disease progression without toxicity. These findings suggest that delivery of miRNAs that are highly expressed and therefore tolerated in normal tissues but lost in disease cells may provide a general strategy for miRNA replacement therapies."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression posttranscriptionally through RNA silencing, a mechanism conserved in eukaryotes. Prevailing models entail most animal miRNAs affecting gene expression by blocking mRNA translation and most plant miRNAs, triggering mRNA cleavage. Here, using polysome fractionation in Arabidopsis thaliana, we found that a portion of mature miRNAs and ARGONAUTE1 (AGO1) is associated with polysomes, likely through their mRNA target. We observed enhanced accumulation of several distinct miRNA targets at both the mRNA and protein levels in an ago1 hypomorphic mutant. By contrast, translational repression, but not cleavage, persisted in transgenic plants expressing the slicing-inhibitor 2b protein from Cucumber mosaic virus. In agreement, we found that the polysome association of miR168 was lost in ago1 but maintained in 2b plants, indicating that translational repression is correlated with the presence of miRNAs and AGO1 in polysomes. This work provides direct biochemical evidence for a translational component in the plant miRNA pathway."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have critical roles in the regulation of gene expression; however, as miRNA activity requires base pairing with only 6-8 nucleotides of messenger RNA, predicting target mRNAs is a major challenge. Recently, high-throughput sequencing of RNAs isolated by crosslinking immunoprecipitation (HITS-CLIP) has identified functional protein-RNA interaction sites. Here we use HITS-CLIP to covalently crosslink native argonaute (Ago, also called Eif2c) protein-RNA complexes in mouse brain. This produced two simultaneous data sets-Ago-miRNA and Ago-mRNA binding sites-that were combined with bioinformatic analysis to identify interaction sites between miRNA and target mRNA. We validated genome-wide interaction maps for miR-124, and generated additional maps for the 20 most abundant miRNAs present in P13 mouse brain. Ago HITS-CLIP provides a general platform for exploring the specificity and range of miRNA action in vivo, and identifies precise sequences for targeting clinically relevant miRNA-mRNA interactions."

        "abstract": "The advent of microRNA has potentially uncovered a new level of complexity to be considered for every biological process. Through the modulation of transcription and translation, microRNA alter the basal state of cells and the outcome of stimulatory events. The exact effect of the microRNA network and individual microRNA on cellular processes is only just starting to be dissected. In the immune system, microRNA appear to have a key role in the early differentiation and effector differentiation of B cells. In T cells, microRNA have been shown to be key regulators of the lineage induction pathways, and to have a strong role in the induction, function and maintenance of the regulatory T-cell lineage. MicroRNA are also important for regulating the differentiation of dendritic cells and macrophages via toll-like receptors, with responsibilities in suppressing effector function before activation and enhancing function after stimulation. In addition to regulating key processes in the immune system, microRNA may also represent an archaic immune system themselves. Small interfering RNA of viral origin has been shown to function as an intracellular mediator in the suppression of viral infection in eukaryotes as diverse as plants, insects, nematodes and fungi, and there is growing evidence that endogenous mammalian microRNA can have similar impacts. In this article we speculate that the anti-viral function of microRNA drove the expression of different subsets of microRNA in different cellular lineages, which may have, in turn, led to the myriad of roles microRNA play in lineage differentiation and stability."

In addition, we discuss the therapeutic potential for the treatment of endothelial cell dysfunction and associated vascular pathophysiological conditions."

        "abstract": "Translation inhibition is a major but poorly understood mode of action of microRNAs (miRNAs) in plants and animals. In particular, the subcellular location where this process takes place is unknown. Here, we show that the translation inhibition, but not the mRNA cleavage activity, of Arabidopsis miRNAs requires ALTERED MERISTEM PROGRAM1 (AMP1). AMP1 encodes an integral membrane protein associated with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and ARGONAUTE1, the miRNA effector and a peripheral ER membrane protein. Large differences in polysome association of miRNA target RNAs are found between wild-type and the amp1 mutant for membrane-bound, but not total, polysomes. This, together with AMP1-independent recruitment of miRNA target transcripts to membrane fractions, shows that miRNAs inhibit the translation of target RNAs on the ER. This study demonstrates that translation inhibition is an important activity of plant miRNAs, reveals the subcellular location of this activity, and uncovers a previously unknown function of the ER."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have become one of the hottest topics in biology over recent years, but remarkably have only been formally recognized for just over 10 years. These endogenously produced short (19-24 nt) non-coding RNAs have introduced an entirely new paradigm in our understanding of gene control and it is now evident that miRNAs play a crucial regulatory role in many, if not all, physiological and pathological processes. In this review we provide an overview of the role and potential clinical utility for miRNAs in hematological malignancies and their function in normal hematopoiesis. Although still in its infancy, the miRNA field has already added much to our understanding of hematological processes, and provides us with novel tools as both biomarkers and therapeutic agents for hematological malignancies."

        "abstract": "Discoveries on nonprotein-coding RNAs have induced a paradigm shift in our overall understanding of gene expression and regulation. We now understand that coding and noncoding RNA machinery work in concert to maintain overall homeostasis. Based on their length, noncoding RNAs are broadly classified into two groups-long (>200\u2009nt) and small noncoding RNAs (<200\u2009nt). These RNAs perform diverse functions-gene regulation, splicing, translation, and posttranscriptional modifications. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) and PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are two classes of small noncoding RNAs that are now classified as master regulators of gene expression. They have also demonstrated clinical significance as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for several diseases, including cancer. Despite these similarities, both these RNAs are generated through contrasting mechanisms, and one of the aims of this review is to cover the distance travelled since their discovery and compare and contrast the various facets of these RNAs. Although these RNAs show tremendous promise as biomarkers, translating the findings from bench to bedside is often met with roadblocks. The second aim of this review therefore is to highlight some of the challenges that hinder application of miRNA and piRNA as in guiding treatment decisions."

Although miRNA research in ocular infection remains in its early stages, a handful of pioneering studies have provided insight into the roles of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of parasitic, fungal, bacterial, and viral ocular infections. Here, we review the current status of research in miRNAs in several major ocular infectious diseases. We predict that the field of miRNAs in ocular infection will greatly expand with the discovery of novel miRNA-involved molecular mechanisms that will inform development of new therapies and identify novel diagnostic biomarkers."

        "abstract": "In Caenorhabditis elegans, the introduction of double-stranded RNA triggers sequence-specific genetic interference (RNAi) that is transmitted to offspring. The inheritance properties associated with this phenomenon were examined. Transmission of the interference effect occurred through a dominant extragenic agent. The wild-type activities of the RNAi pathway genes rde-1 and rde-4 were required for the formation of this interfering agent but were not needed for interference thereafter. In contrast, the rde-2 and mut-7 genes were required downstream for interference. These findings provide evidence for germ line transmission of an extragenic sequence-specific silencing factor and implicate rde-1 and rde-4 in the formation of the inherited agent."

        "abstract": "In a diverse group of organisms that includes Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila, planaria, hydra, trypanosomes, fungi and plants, the introduction of double-stranded RNAs inhibits gene expression in a sequence-specific manner. These responses, called RNA interference or post-transcriptional gene silencing, may provide anti-viral defence, modulate transposition or regulate gene expression. We have taken a biochemical approach towards elucidating the mechanisms underlying this genetic phenomenon. Here we show that 'loss-of-function' phenotypes can be created in cultured Drosophila cells by transfection with specific double-stranded RNAs. This coincides with a marked reduction in the level of cognate cellular messenger RNAs. Extracts of transfected cells contain a nuclease activity that specifically degrades exogenous transcripts homologous to transfected double-stranded RNA. This enzyme contains an essential RNA component. After partial purification, the sequence-specific nuclease co-fractionates with a discrete, approximately 25-nucleotide RNA species which may confer specificity to the enzyme through homology to the substrate mRNAs."

        "title": "Disruption of GW bodies impairs mammalian RNA interference.",
        "abstract": "The GW182 RNA-binding protein was initially shown to associate with a specific subset of mRNAs and to reside within discrete cytoplasmic foci named GW bodies (GWBs). GWBs are enriched in proteins that are involved in mRNA degradation. Recent reports have shown that exogenously introduced human Argonaute-2 (Ago2) is also enriched in GWBs, indicating that RNA interference function may be somehow linked to these structures. In this report, we demonstrate that endogenous Ago2 and transfected small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are also present within these same cytoplasmic bodies and that the GW182 protein interacts with Ago2. Disruption of these cytoplasmic foci in HeLa cells interferes with the silencing capability of a siRNA that is specific to lamin-A/C. Our data support a model in which GW182 and/or the microenvironment of the cytoplasmic GWBs contribute to the RNA-induced silencing complex and to RNA silencing."

        "abstract": "In animals, the majority of microRNAs regulate gene expression through the RNA interference (RNAi) machinery without inducing small-interfering RNA (siRNA)-directed mRNA cleavage. Thus, the mechanisms by which microRNAs repress their targets have remained elusive. Recently, Argonaute proteins, which are key RNAi effector components, and their target mRNAs were shown to localize to cytoplasmic foci known as P-bodies or GW-bodies. Here, we show that the Argonaute proteins physically interact with a key P-/GW-body subunit, GW182. Silencing of GW182 delocalizes resident P-/GW-body proteins and impairs the silencing of microRNA reporters. Moreover, mutations that prevent Argonaute proteins from localizing in P-/GW-bodies prevent translational repression of mRNAs even when Argonaute is tethered to its target in a siRNA-independent fashion. Thus, our results support a functional link between cytoplasmic P-bodies and the ability of a microRNA to repress expression of a target mRNA."

        "title": "Slicer function of Drosophila Argonautes and its involvement in RISC formation.",
        "abstract": "Argonaute proteins play important yet distinct roles in RNA silencing. Human Argonaute2 (hAgo2) was shown to be responsible for target RNA cleavage (\"Slicer\") activity in RNA interference (RNAi), whereas other Argonaute subfamily members do not exhibit the Slicer activity in humans. In Drosophila, AGO2 was shown to possess the Slicer activity. Here we show that AGO1, another member of the Drosophila Argonaute subfamily, immunopurified from Schneider2 (S2) cells associates with microRNA (miRNA) and cleaves target RNA completely complementary to the miRNA. Slicer activity is reconstituted with recombinant full-length AGO1. Thus, in Drosophila, unlike in humans, both AGO1 and AGO2 have Slicer functions. Further, reconstitution of Slicer activity with recombinant PIWI domains of AGO1 and AGO2 demonstrates that other regions in the Argonautes are not strictly necessary for small interfering RNA (siRNA)-binding and cleavage activities. It has been shown that in circumstances with AGO2-lacking, the siRNA duplex is not unwound and consequently an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) is not formed. We show that upon addition of an siRNA duplex in S2 lysate, the passenger strand is cleaved in an AGO2-dependent manner, and nuclease-resistant modification of the passenger strand impairs RISC formation. These findings give rise to a new model in which AGO2 is directly involved in RISC formation as \"Slicer\" of the passenger strand of the siRNA duplex."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) repress translation of target mRNAs by interaction with partially mismatched sequences in their 3' UTR. The mechanism by which they act on translation has remained largely obscure. We examined the translation of mRNAs containing four partially mismatched miRNA-binding sites in the 3' UTR in HeLa cells cotransfected with a cognate miRNA. The mRNAs were prepared by in vitro transcription and were engineered to employ different modes of translation initiation. We find that the 5' cap structure and the 3' poly(A) tail are each necessary but not sufficient for full miRNA-mediated repression of mRNA translation. Replacing the cap structure with an internal ribosome entry site from either the cricket paralysis virus or the encephalomyocarditis virus impairs miRNA-mediated repression. Collectively, these results demonstrate that miRNAs interfere with the initiation step of translation and implicate the cap-binding protein eukaryotic initiation factor 4E as a molecular target."

Our biochemical analysis revealed that Ago2 is present in a pre-miRNA processing complex that is able to transfer the miRNA into a target-mRNA cleaving complex. To gain insight into the function and composition of RNA silencing complexes, we purified Ago1- and Ago2-containing complexes from human cells. Several known Ago1- and/or Ago2-associated proteins including Dicer were identified, but also two novel factors, the putative RNA helicase MOV10, and the RNA recognition motif (RRM)-containing protein TNRC6B/KIAA1093. The new proteins localize, similar to Ago proteins, to mRNA-degrading cytoplasmic P bodies, and they are functionally required to mediate miRNA-guided mRNA cleavage."

        "abstract": "Double-stranded RNAs can suppress expression of homologous genes through an evolutionarily conserved process named RNA interference (RNAi) or post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS). One mechanism underlying silencing is degradation of target mRNAs by an RNP complex, which contains approximately 22 nt of siRNAs as guides to substrate selection. A bidentate nuclease called Dicer has been implicated as the protein responsible for siRNA production. Here we characterize the Caenorhabditis elegans ortholog of Dicer (K12H4.8; dcr-1) in vivo and in vitro. dcr-1 mutants show a defect in RNAi. Furthermore, a combination of phenotypic abnormalities and RNA analysis suggests a role for dcr-1 in a regulatory pathway comprised of small temporal RNA (let-7) and its target (e.g., lin-41)."

        "abstract": "Using grafting procedures, we investigated the transmission of co-suppression of nitrate reductase and nitrite reductase host genes and transgenes and of post-transcriptional silencing of a uidA transgene encoding glucuronidase in tobacco. We demonstrate that silencing is transmitted with 100% efficiency from silenced stocks to non-silenced scions expressing the corresponding transgene. Transmission is unidirectional from stock to scion, transgene specific, locus independent and requires the presence of a transcriptionally active transgene in the target scion. The transmission of co-suppression occurs when silenced stocks and non-silenced target scions are physically separated by up to 30 cm of stem of a non-target wild-type plant. Taken together, these results suggest that a non-metabolic, transgene-specific, diffusable messenger mediates the propagation of de novo post-transcriptional silencing through the plant."

Here, we demonstrate that human pre-miRNA nuclear export, and miRNA function, are dependent on Exportin-5. Exportin-5 can bind pre-miRNAs specifically in vitro, but only in the presence of the Ran-GTP cofactor. Short hairpin RNAs, artificial pre-miRNA analogs used to express small interfering RNAs, also depend on Exportin-5 for nuclear export. Together, these findings define an additional cellular cofactor required for miRNA biogenesis and function."

        "abstract": "How left/right functional asymmetry is layered on top of an anatomically symmetrical nervous system is poorly understood. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, two morphologically bilateral taste receptor neurons, ASE left (ASEL) and ASE right (ASER), display a left/right asymmetrical expression pattern of putative chemoreceptor genes that correlates with a diversification of chemosensory specificities. Here we show that a previously undefined microRNA termed lsy-6 controls this neuronal left/right asymmetry of chemosensory receptor expression. lsy-6 mutants that we retrieved from a genetic screen for defects in neuronal left/right asymmetry display a loss of the ASEL-specific chemoreceptor expression profile with a concomitant gain of the ASER-specific profile. A lsy-6 reporter gene construct is expressed in less than ten neurons including ASEL, but not ASER. lsy-6 exerts its effects on ASEL through repression of cog-1, an Nkx-type homeobox gene, which contains a lsy-6 complementary site in its 3' untranslated region and that has been shown to control ASE-specific chemoreceptor expression profiles. lsy-6 is the first microRNA to our knowledge with a role in neuronal patterning, providing new insights into left/right axis formation."

The regulatory mechanisms that control localized translation in neurons are not well understood. We propose a role for microRNAs (miRNAs), a class of noncoding RNAs, as mediators of neuronal translational regulation. We have identified 86 miRNAs expressed in mammalian neurons, of which 40 have not previously been reported. A subset of these miRNAs exhibits temporally regulated expression in cortical cultures. Moreover, all of the miRNAs that were tested cofractionate with polyribosomes, the sites of active translation. These findings indicate that a large, diverse population of miRNAs may function to regulate translation in mammalian neurons."

        "title": "Identification of Drosophila MicroRNA targets.",
        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short RNA molecules that regulate gene expression by binding to target messenger RNAs and by controlling protein production or causing RNA cleavage. To date, functions have been assigned to only a few of the hundreds of identified miRNAs, in part because of the difficulty in identifying their targets. The short length of miRNAs and the fact that their complementarity to target sequences is imperfect mean that target identification in animal genomes is not possible by standard sequence comparison methods. Here we screen conserved 3' UTR sequences from the Drosophila melanogaster genome for potential miRNA targets. The screening procedure combines a sequence search with an evaluation of the predicted miRNA-target heteroduplex structures and energies. We show that this approach successfully identifies the five previously validated let-7, lin-4, and bantam targets from a large database and predict new targets for Drosophila miRNAs. Our target predictions reveal striking clusters of functionally related targets among the top predictions for specific miRNAs. These include Notch target genes for miR-7, proapoptotic genes for the miR-2 family, and enzymes from a metabolic pathway for miR-277. We experimentally verified three predicted targets each for miR-7 and the miR-2 family, doubling the number of validated targets for animal miRNAs. Statistical analysis indicates that the best single predicted target sites are at the border of significance; thus, target predictions should be considered as tentative until experimentally validated. We identify features shared by all validated targets that can be used to evaluate target predictions for animal miRNAs. Our initial evaluation and experimental validation of target predictions suggest functions for two miRNAs. For others, the screen suggests plausible functions, such as a role for miR-277 as a metabolic switch controlling amino acid catabolism. Cross-genome comparison proved essential, as it allows reduction of the sequence search space. Improvements in genome annotation and increased availability of cDNA sequences from other genomes will allow more sensitive screens. An increase in the number of confirmed targets is expected to reveal general structural features that can be used to improve their detection. While the screen is likely to miss some targets, our study shows that valid targets can be identified from sequence alone."

However, the mRNAs regulated by vertebrate miRNAs are all unknown. Here we predict more than 400 regulatory target genes for the conserved vertebrate miRNAs by identifying mRNAs with conserved pairing to the 5' region of the miRNA and evaluating the number and quality of these complementary sites. Rigorous tests using shuffled miRNA controls supported a majority of these predictions, with the fraction of false positives estimated at 31% for targets identified in human, mouse, and rat and 22% for targets identified in pufferfish as well as mammals. Eleven predicted targets (out of 15 tested) were supported experimentally using a HeLa cell reporter system. The predicted regulatory targets of mammalian miRNAs were enriched for genes involved in transcriptional regulation but also encompassed an unexpectedly broad range of other functions."

It appears that, whereas the anti-viral process seems to be similarly conserved from plants to insects, even in worms, RNA silencing does influence the replication of mammalian viruses but in a particular mode: micro(mi)RNAs, endogenous small RNAs naturally implicated in translational control, rather than virus-derived small interfering (si)RNAs like in other organisms, are involved. In fact, these recent studies even suggest that RNA silencing may be beneficial for viral replication. Accordingly, several large DNA mammalian viruses have been shown to encode their own miRNAs. Here, we summarize the seminal studies that have implicated RNA silencing in viral infection and compare the different eukaryotic responses."

        "abstract": "The specialized ribonuclease Dicer initiates RNA interference by cleaving double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) substrates into small fragments about 25 nucleotides in length. In the crystal structure of an intact Dicer enzyme, the PAZ domain, a module that binds the end of dsRNA, is separated from the two catalytic ribonuclease III (RNase III) domains by a flat, positively charged surface. The 65 angstrom distance between the PAZ and RNase III domains matches the length spanned by 25 base pairs of RNA. Thus, Dicer itself is a molecular ruler that recognizes dsRNA and cleaves a specified distance from the helical end."

Here, we characterize small interfering (si) RNAs-the hallmarks of silencing-associated with Cabbage leaf curl begomovirus in Arabidopsis and African cassava mosaic begomovirus in Nicotiana benthamiana and cassava. We detected 21, 22 and 24 nt siRNAs of both polarities, derived from both the coding and the intergenic regions of these geminiviruses. Genetic evidence showed that all the 24 nt and a substantial fraction of the 22 nt viral siRNAs are generated by the dicer-like proteins DCL3 and DCL2, respectively. The viral siRNAs were 5' end phosphorylated, as shown by phosphatase treatments, and methylated at the 3'-nucleotide, as shown by HEN1 miRNA methylase-dependent resistance to beta-elimination. Similar modifications were found in all types of endogenous and transgene-derived siRNAs tested, but not in a major fraction of siRNAs from a cytoplasmic RNA tobamovirus. We conclude that several distinct silencing pathways are involved in DNA virus-plant interactions."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs are small, non-coding RNAs that control the translation of target messenger RNAs, thereby regulating critical aspects of plant and animal development. In the mammalian nervous system, the spatiotemporal control of mRNA translation has an important role in synaptic development and plasticity. Although a number of microRNAs have been isolated from the mammalian brain, neither the specific microRNAs that regulate synapse function nor their target mRNAs have been identified. Here we show that a brain-specific microRNA, miR-134, is localized to the synapto-dendritic compartment of rat hippocampal neurons and negatively regulates the size of dendritic spines--postsynaptic sites of excitatory synaptic transmission. This effect is mediated by miR-134 inhibition of the translation of an mRNA encoding a protein kinase, Limk1, that controls spine development. Exposure of neurons to extracellular stimuli such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor relieves miR-134 inhibition of Limk1 translation and in this way may contribute to synaptic development, maturation and/or plasticity."

        "title": "The role of PACT in the RNA silencing pathway.",
        "abstract": "Small RNA-mediated gene silencing (RNA silencing) has emerged as a major regulatory pathway in eukaryotes. Identification of the key factors involved in this pathway has been a subject of rigorous investigation in recent years. In humans, small RNAs are generated by Dicer and assembled into the effector complex known as RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) by multiple factors including hAgo2, the mRNA-targeting endonuclease, and TRBP (HIV-1 TAR RNA-binding protein), a dsRNA-binding protein that interacts with both Dicer and hAgo2. Here we describe an additional dsRNA-binding protein known as PACT, which is significant in RNA silencing. PACT is associated with an approximately 500 kDa complex that contains Dicer, hAgo2, and TRBP. The interaction with Dicer involves the third dsRNA-binding domain (dsRBD) of PACT and the N-terminal region of Dicer containing the helicase motif. Like TRBP, PACT is not required for the pre-microRNA (miRNA) cleavage reaction step. However, the depletion of PACT strongly affects the accumulation of mature miRNA in vivo and moderately reduces the efficiency of small interfering RNA-induced RNA interference. Our study indicates that, unlike other RNase III type proteins, human Dicer may employ two different dsRBD-containing proteins that facilitate RISC assembly."

        "abstract": "It has been reported that some double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) binding proteins interact with small RNA biogenesis-related RNase III enzymes. However, their biological significance is poorly understood. Here we examine the relationship between the Arabidopsis microRNA- (miRNA) producing enzyme DCL1 and the dsRNA binding protein HYL1. In the hyl1-2 mutant, the processing steps of miR163 biogenesis were partially impaired; increased accumulation of pri-miR163 and reduced accumulation of short pre-miR163 and mature miR163 as well as misplaced cleavages in the stem structure of pri-miR163 were detected. These misplaced cleavages were similar to those previously observed in the dcl1-9 mutant, in which the second double-stranded RNA binding domain of the protein was disrupted. An immunoprecipitation assay using Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana showed that HYL1 was able to form a complex with wild-type DCL1 protein, but not with the dcl1-9 mutant protein. We also examined miR164b and miR166a biogenesis in hyl1-2 and dcl1-9. Increased accumulation of pri-miRNAs and reduced accumulation of pre-miRNAs and mature miRNAs were detected. Misplaced cleavage on pri-miR164b was observed only in dcl1-9 but not in hyl1-2, whereas not on pri-miR166a in either mutant. These results indicate that HYL1 has a function in assisting efficient and precise cleavage of pri-miRNA through interaction with DCL1."

        "abstract": "Next-generation sequencing now for the first time allows researchers to gage the depth and variation of entire transcriptomes. However, now as rare transcripts can be detected that are present in cells at single copies, more advanced computational tools are needed to accurately annotate and profile them. microRNAs (miRNAs) are 22 nucleotide small RNAs (sRNAs) that post-transcriptionally reduce the output of protein coding genes. They have established roles in numerous biological processes, including cancers and other diseases. During miRNA biogenesis, the sRNAs are sequentially cleaved from precursor molecules that have a characteristic hairpin RNA structure. The vast majority of new miRNA genes that are discovered are mined from small RNA sequencing (sRNA-seq), which can detect more than a billion RNAs in a single run. However, given that many of the detected RNAs are degradation products from all types of transcripts, the accurate identification of miRNAs remain a non-trivial computational problem. Here, we review the tools available to predict animal miRNAs from sRNA sequencing data. We present tools for generalist and specialist use cases, including prediction from massively pooled data or in species without reference genome. We also present wet-lab methods used to validate predicted miRNAs, and approaches to computationally benchmark prediction accuracy. For each tool, we reference validation experiments and benchmarking efforts. Last, we discuss the future of the field."

In this article, we describe a transient expression system in Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts, which is highly amenable for the dissection of miRNA pathways. We show that by transiently overexpressing primary miRNAs and target mimics, we can manipulate miRNA levels and consequently impact on their targets. Furthermore, we developed a set of luciferase-based sensors for quantifying miRNA activity that respond specifically to both endogenous and overexpressed miRNAs and target mimics. We demonstrate that these miRNA sensors can be used to test the impact of putative components of the miRNA pathway on miRNA activity, as well as the impact of specific mutations, by either overexpression or the use of protoplasts from the corresponding mutants. We further show that our miRNA sensors can be used for investigating the effect of chemicals on miRNA activity. Our cell-based transient expression system is fast and easy to set up, and generates quantitative results, being a powerful tool for assaying miRNA activity in\u00a0vivo."

TaqMan minor groove binder probes were used to discriminate nearly identical members of the let-7 family of miRNA isoforms. The miRNA precursor expression was profiled in 32 human cell lines from lung, breast, colorectal, hematologic, prostate, pancreatic, and head and neck cancers. Some miRNA precursors were expressed at similar levels in many of the cell lines, while others were differentially expressed. Clustering analysis of the miRNA precursor expression data revealed that most of the cell lines clustered into their respective tissues from which each cell line was ostensibly derived. miRNA precursor expression by PCR paralleled the mature miRNA expression by northern blotting for most of the conditions studied. Our study provides PCR primer sequences to all of the known human miRNA precursors as of December 2004 and provides a database of the miRNA precursor expression in many commonly used human cancer cell lines."

        "title": "Anti-miRNA oligonucleotides (AMOs): ammunition to target miRNAs implicated in human disease?",
        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous 19-25 nucleotide RNAs that have recently emerged as a novel class of important gene-regulatory molecules involved in many critical developmental and cellular functions. miRNAs have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several human diseases, such as neurodegenerative disorders, cancer, and more recently in viral and metabolic diseases. Unraveling the roles of miRNAs in cellular processes linked to human diseases will lead to novel opportunities for the regulation of protein function and will help to evaluate their potential for therapeutic intervention. Approaches to interfere with miRNA function in vitro and in vivo based on synthetic anti-miRNA oligonucleotides (AMOs) are discussed in this review."

        "abstract": "RNAi is a conserved gene-specific regulatory mechanism, which silences target gene expression transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally. The RNAi machinery converts the sequence specific information of a long double stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) into small 21-22 nt long dsRNAs (siRNAs, miRNAs) which assemble into an effector complex, the RNA induced silencing complex (RISC). RISC assembly is asymmetric; one strand of an siRNA or a miRNA preferentially incorporates into the RNA-protein complex. Here, I review the rules of the asymmetric RISC formation and discuss their possible regulatory function in several steps in RNAi."

        "abstract": "Small interfering RNA (siRNA) and microRNA (miRNA) are small RNAs of 18-25 nucleotides (nt) in length that play important roles in regulating gene expression. They are incorporated into an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and serve as guides for silencing their corresponding target mRNAs based on complementary base-pairing. The promise of gene silencing has led many researchers to consider siRNA as an anti-viral tool. However, in long-term settings, many viruses appear to escape from this therapeutical strategy. An example of this may be seen in the case of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) which is able to evade RNA silencing by either mutating the siRNA-targeted sequence or by encoding for a partial suppressor of RNAi (RNA interference). On the other hand, because miRNA targeting does not require absolute complementarity of base-pairing, mutational escape by viruses from miRNA-specified silencing may be more difficult to achieve. In this review, we discuss stratagems used by various viruses to avoid the cells' antiviral si/mi-RNA defenses and notions of how viruses might control and regulate host cell genes by encoding viral miRNAs (vmiRNAs)."

        "title": "A human, ATP-independent, RISC assembly machine fueled by pre-miRNA.",
        "abstract": "RNA interference (RNAi) is mediated by RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISCs), which are guided by microRNAs (miRNAs) or short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to cognate RNA targets. In humans, the catalytic engine of RISC is a ribonucleoprotein formed by the Argonaute2 (Ago2) protein and either miRNA (miRNP) or siRNA (siRNP). The Dicer nuclease produces mature miRNAs and siRNAs from pre-miRNAs and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), respectively, and associates with Ago2. Here, we studied the assembly of human RISC by presenting pre-miRNA to immunopurified complexes that contain Ago2, Dicer, and TRBP. Mature miRNAs were produced in an ATP-independent manner and guided specific cleavage of cognate RNA targets in a pattern that is typical of RISC. This de novo formed RISC activity dissociated from Dicer. The asymmetry of the RISC loading process was fully recapitulated in this system, which, however, could not efficiently assemble RISC from siRNA duplexes. Our findings demonstrate that, in humans, a miRNA loading complex (miRLC) is formed by Ago2 and Dicer prior to their encounter with pre-miRNA. We suggest that the miRLC couples the processing of the pre-miRNA substrate to the unwinding of the product and that after loading of the mature miRNA to Ago2, the miRLC disassembles and the miRNP is released."

        "title": "Specific microRNAs modulate embryonic stem cell-derived neurogenesis.",
        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are recently discovered small non-coding transcripts with a broad spectrum of functions described mostly in invertebrates. As post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression, miRNAs trigger target mRNA degradation or translational repression. Although hundreds of miRNAs have been cloned from a variety of mammalian tissues and cells and multiple mRNA targets have been predicted, little is known about their functions. So far, a role of miRNA has only been described in hematopoietic, adipocytic, and muscle differentiation; regulation of insulin secretion; and potentially regulation of cancer growth. Here, we describe miRNA expression profiling in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cell- derived neurogenesis in vitro and show that a number of miRNAs are simultaneously co-induced during differentiation of neural progenitor cells to neurons and astrocytes. There was a clear correlation between miRNA expression profiles in ES cell-derived neurogenesis in vitro and in embryonal neurogenesis in vivo. Using both gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches, we demonstrate that brain-specific miR-124a and miR-9 molecules affect neural lineage differentiation in the ES cell-derived cultures. In addition, we provide evidence that signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3, a member of the STAT family pathway, is involved in the function of these miRNAs. We conclude that distinct miRNAs play a functional role in the determination of neural fates in ES cell differentiation."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNAs that function as endogenous triggers of the RNA interference pathway. Originally discovered in Caenorhabditis elegans, this group of tiny RNAs has moved to the forefront of biology. With over 300 miRNA genes identified in the human genome, and a plethora of predicted mRNA targets, it is believed that these small RNAs have a central role in diverse cellular and developmental processes. Concordant with this, aberrant expression of miRNA genes could lead to human disease, including cancer. Although the connection of miRNAs with cancer has been suspected for several years, four recent studies have confirmed the suspicion that miRNAs regulate cell proliferation and apoptosis, and play a role in cancer."

        "abstract": "Apart from alterations in the RET/PTC-RAS-BRAF pathway, comparatively little is known about the genetics of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). We show that numerous microRNAs (miRNAs) are transcriptionally up-regulated in PTC tumors compared with unaffected thyroid tissue. A set of five miRNAs, including the three most up-regulated ones (miR-221, -222, and -146), distinguished unequivocally between PTC and normal thyroid. Additionally, miR-221 was up-regulated in unaffected thyroid tissue in several PTC patients, presumably an early event in carcinogenesis. Tumors in which the up-regulation (11- to 19-fold) of miR-221, -222, and -146 was strongest showed dramatic loss of KIT transcript and Kit protein. In 5 of 10 such cases, this down expression was associated with germline single-nucleotide changes in the two recognition sequences in KIT for these miRNAs. We conclude that up-regulation of several miRs and regulation of KIT are involved in PTC pathogenesis, and that sequence changes in genes targeted by miRNAs can contribute to their regulation."

        "abstract": "Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) are involved in editing of adenosine residues to inosine in double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Although this editing recodes and alters functions of several mammalian genes, its most common targets are noncoding repeat sequences, indicating the involvement of this editing system in currently unknown functions other than recoding of protein sequences. Here we show that specific adenosine residues of certain microRNA (miRNA) precursors are edited by ADAR1 and ADAR2. Editing of pri-miR-142, the precursor of miRNA-142, expressed in hematopoietic tissues, resulted in suppression of its processing by Drosha. The edited pri-miR-142 was degraded by Tudor-SN, a component of RISC and also a ribonuclease specific to inosine-containing dsRNAs. Consequently, mature miRNA-142 expression levels increased substantially in ADAR1 null or ADAR2 null mice. Our results demonstrate a new function of RNA editing in the control of miRNA biogenesis."

TLR activation leads to the production of proinflammatory mediators and thus TLR signaling must be properly regulated by various mechanisms to maintain homeostasis. TLR4-ligand lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced tolerance or cross-tolerance is one such mechanism, and it plays an important role in innate immunity. Tolerance is established and sustained by the activity of the microRNA miR-146a, which is known to target key elements of the myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) signaling pathway, including IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK1), IRAK2 and tumor-necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6). In this review, we comprehensively examine the TLR signaling involved in innate immunity, with special focus on LPS-induced tolerance. The function of TLR ligand-induced microRNAs, including miR-146a, miR-155 and miR-132, in regulating inflammatory mediators, and their impact on the immune system and human diseases, are discussed. Modulation of these microRNAs may affect TLR pathway activation and help to develop therapeutics against inflammatory diseases."

The RNA silencing pathways are now recognized as key factors that connect together the many variations in biological processes, including transcriptional gene regulation, post-transcriptional gene silencing, translational gene silencing, apoptosis, meiosis, and antiviral defense. The utilization of small RNAs represents a specific, energy conserving, and fast mechanism of gene regulation via a core system known as RNA interference."

        "abstract": "Small regulatory RNAs guide gene silencing at the DNA or RNA level through repression of complementary sequences. The two main forms of small RNAs are microRNA (miRNA) and small interfering RNA (siRNAs), which are generated from the processing of different forms of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) precursors. These two forms of small regulatory RNAs function in distinct but overlapping gene silencing pathways in plants. Gene silencing pathways in eukaryotes evolved from an ancient prokaryotic mechanism involved in genome defense against invasive genetic elements, but has since diversified to also play a crucial role in regulation of endogenous gene expression. Here, we review the biogenesis of the different forms of small RNAs in plants, including miRNAs, phased, secondary siRNAs (phasiRNAs) and heterochromatic siRNAs (hetsiRNAs), with a focus on their functions in genome defense, transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene silencing, RNA-directed DNA methylation, trans-chromosomal methylation and paramutation. We also discuss the important role that gene duplication has played in the functional diversification of gene silencing pathways in plants, and we highlight recently discovered components of gene silencing pathways in plants."

Argonaute proteins are highly specialized binding modules that accommodate the small RNA component - such as microRNAs (miRNAs), short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) or PIWI-associated RNAs (piRNAs) - and coordinate downstream gene-silencing events by interacting with other protein factors. Recent work has made progress in our understanding of classical Argonaute-mediated gene-silencing principles, such as the effects on mRNA translation and decay, but has also implicated Argonaute proteins in several other cellular processes, such as transcriptional regulation and splicing."

        "abstract": "Dicer is a central enzyme in microRNA (miRNA) processing. We identified a Dicer-independent miRNA biogenesis pathway that uses Argonaute2 (Ago2) slicer catalytic activity. In contrast to other miRNAs, miR-451 levels were refractory to dicer loss of function but were reduced in MZago2 (maternal-zygotic) mutants. We found that pre-miR-451 processing requires Ago2 catalytic activity in vivo. MZago2 mutants showed delayed erythropoiesis that could be rescued by wild-type Ago2 or miR-451-duplex but not by catalytically dead Ago2. Changing the secondary structure of Dicer-dependent miRNAs to mimic that of pre-miR-451 restored miRNA function and rescued developmental defects in MZdicer mutants, indicating that the pre-miRNA secondary structure determines the processing pathway in vivo. We propose that Ago2-mediated cleavage of pre-miRNAs, followed by uridylation and trimming, generates functional miRNAs independently of Dicer."

        "abstract": "Endogenous small RNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression by mechanisms conserved across metazoans. While the number of verified human miRNAs is still expanding, only few have been functionally annotated. To perform genetic screens for novel functions of miRNAs, we developed a library of vectors expressing the majority of cloned human miRNAs and created corresponding DNA barcode arrays. In a screen for miRNAs that cooperate with oncogenes in cellular transformation, we identified miR-372 and miR-373, each permitting proliferation and tumorigenesis of primary human cells that harbor both oncogenic RAS and active wild-type p53. These miRNAs neutralize p53-mediated CDK inhibition, possibly through direct inhibition of the expression of the tumor-suppressor LATS2. We provide evidence that these miRNAs are potential novel oncogenes participating in the development of human testicular germ cell tumors by numbing the p53 pathway, thus allowing tumorigenic growth in the presence of wild-type p53."

Several computational methods have been developed to describe the target recognition mechanism by miRNA. We propose here a novel method to detect miRNA-mRNA complexes in eukaryotic cells. As a first step, we synthesize cDNA on an mRNA template using miRNAs as the endogenous cytoplasmic primer. This step extends miRNA and overcomes the problem of low complementary binding of miRNAs to their targets. Purified hybrid 3'-cDNA-miRNA-5' molecules are used in a second round of reverse transcription to anneal to target mRNA in a highly gene-specific manner. The 5'-end analysis of these cDNA molecules demonstrated that primers for cDNAs were \"signatures\" of miRNA molecules, and over-expression of their full-length mature miRNAs resulted in functional inhibition of target protein expression."

Our understanding of small RNA biology has significantly improved in recent years, and it is now clear that there are several cellular silencing pathways in addition to those involved in defense. Endogenous silencing pathways have important roles in gene regulation at the transcriptional, RNA stability and translational levels. They share a common core of small RNA generator and effector proteins with multiple paralogs in plant genomes, some of which have acquired highly specialized functions. Here, we review recent developments in the plant RNA silencing field that have identified components of specific silencing pathways and have shed light on the mechanisms and biological roles of RNA silencing in plants."

The advent of high-throughput techniques has revealed that miRNA expression is deregulated in almost all human tumors (both solid and hematologic) with respect to the normal tissue counterpart. These differences frequently recur in tumor-specific miRNA signatures, which are very helpful to diagnose the tissue of origin of the neoplasia, and sometimes also specific tumor subtypes. Increasing evidence also supports a role for miRNAs as prognostic biomarkers of human cancers. Finally, miRNAs are differentially expressed in the blood of cancer patients versus healthy donors, providing a rationale for the detection of miRNAs and diagnostic and prognostic circulating biomarkers."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) control gene expression in animals, plants, and unicellular eukaryotes by promoting degradation or repressing translation of target mRNAs. miRNA expression is often tissue specific and developmentally regulated, and regulation occurs both transcriptionally and posttranscriptionally. This regulation is crucial, as alteration of miRNA expression has been linked to human diseases, including several cancers. Here, we discuss recent studies that shed light on how multiple steps in the miRNA biogenesis pathway are regulated to modulate miRNA function in animals."

        "abstract": "In RNA-directed silencing pathways, ternary complexes result from small RNA-guided ARGONAUTE (AGO) associating with target transcripts. Target transcripts are often silenced through direct cleavage (slicing), destabilization through slicer-independent turnover mechanisms, and translational repression. Here, wild-type and active-site defective forms of several Arabidopsis thaliana AGO proteins involved in posttranscriptional silencing were used to examine several AGO functions, including small RNA binding, interaction with target RNA, slicing or destabilization of target RNA, secondary small interfering RNA formation, and antiviral activity. Complementation analyses in ago mutant plants revealed that the catalytic residues of AGO1, AGO2, and AGO7 are required to restore the defects of Arabidopsis ago1-25, ago2-1, and zip-1 (AGO7-defective) mutants, respectively. AGO2 had slicer activity in transient assays but could not trigger secondary small interfering RNA biogenesis, and catalytically active AGO2 was necessary for local and systemic antiviral activity against Turnip mosaic virus. Slicer-defective AGOs associated with miRNAs and stabilized AGO-miRNA-target RNA ternary complexes in individual target coimmunoprecipitation assays. In genome-wide AGO-miRNA-target RNA coimmunoprecipitation experiments, slicer-defective AGO1-miRNA associated with target RNA more effectively than did wild-type AGO1-miRNA. These data not only reveal functional roles for AGO1, AGO2, and AGO7 slicer activity, but also indicate an approach to capture ternary complexes more efficiently for genome-wide analyses."

        "title": "Computational identification of microRNA targets.",
        "abstract": "Recent experiments have shown that the genomes of organisms such as worm, fly, human, and mouse encode hundreds of microRNA genes. Many of these microRNAs are thought to regulate the translational expression of other genes by binding to partially complementary sites in messenger RNAs. Phenotypic and expression analysis suggests an important role of microRNAs during development. Therefore, it is of fundamental importance to identify microRNA targets. However, no experimental or computational high-throughput method for target site identification in animals has been published yet. Our main result is a new computational method that is designed to identify microRNA target sites. This method recovers with high specificity known microRNA target sites that have previously been defined experimentally. Based on these results, we present a simple model for the mechanism of microRNA target site recognition. Our model incorporates both kinetic and thermodynamic components of target recognition. When we applied our method to a set of 74 Drosophila melanogaster microRNAs, searching 3'UTR sequences of a predefined set of fly mRNAs for target sites which were evolutionary conserved between D. melanogaster and Drosophila pseudoobscura, we found that many key developmental body patterning genes such as hairy and fushi-tarazu are likely to be translationally regulated by microRNAs."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of noncoding RNAs found in organisms as evolutionarily distant as plants and mammals, yet most of the mRNAs they regulate are unknown. Here we show that the ability of an miRNA to translationally repress a target mRNA is largely dictated by the free energy of binding of the first eight nucleotides in the 5' region of the miRNA. However, G:U wobble base-pairing in this region interferes with activity beyond that predicted on the basis of thermodynamic stability. Furthermore, an mRNA can be simultaneously repressed by more than one miRNA species. The level of repression achieved is dependent on both the amount of mRNA and the amount of available miRNA complexes. Thus, predicted miRNA:mRNA interactions must be viewed in the context of other potential interactions and cellular conditions."

        "abstract": "Regulatory small RNAs, which range in size from 20 to 24 nucleotides, are ubiquitous components of endogenous plant transcriptomes, as well as common responses to exogenous viral infections and introduced double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Endogenous small RNAs derive from the processing of helical RNA precursors and can be categorized into several groups based on differences in biogenesis and function. A major distinction can be observed between small RNAs derived from single-stranded precursors with a hairpin structure [referred to here as hairpin RNAs (hpRNAs)] and those derived from dsRNA precursors [small interfering RNAs (siRNAs)]. hpRNAs in plants can be divided into two secondary groups: microRNAs and those that are not microRNAs. The currently known siRNAs fall mostly into one of three secondary groups: heterochromatic siRNAs, secondary siRNAs, and natural antisense transcript siRNAs. Tertiary subdivisions can be identified within many of the secondary classifications as well. Comparisons between the different classes of plant small RNAs help to illuminate key goals for future research."

        "abstract": "The 'nuclear side' of RNA interference (RNAi) is increasingly recognized as an integral part of RNA-mediated gene silencing networks. Current data are consistent with the idea that epigenetic changes, such as DNA (cytosine-5) methylation and histone modifications, can be targeted to identical DNA sequences by short RNAs derived via Dicer cleavage of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). To determine the relationships among RNA signals, DNA methylation and chromatin structure, we are carrying out a genetic analysis of RNA-mediated transcriptional gene silencing (TGS) in Arabidopsis. Results obtained so far indicate that in response to RNA signals, different site-specific DNA methyltransferases (DMTases) cooperate with each other and eventually with histone-modifying enzymes to establish and maintain a transcriptionally inactive state at a homologous target promoter. Processing of dsRNA in Arabidopsis occurs in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm, where distinct Dicer-like (DCL) activities are thought to generate functionally distinct classes of short RNAs. RNA silencing pathways thus operate throughout the cell to defend against invasive nucleic acids and to regulate genome structure and function."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are present in both plant and animal kingdoms and represents a growing family of non-coding RNAs. These tiny RNAs act as small guides and direct negative regulations usually in the process of development through sequence complementarity to target mRNAs. Although a large number of miRNAs have been identified from various animals, so far plant miRNA studies have focused mainly on Arabidopsis. Here we describe the identification of 20 miRNAs from a rice cDNA library. All the miRNAs were presumably processed from precursors with stem-loop structures and were positively detected in rice cells from at least one tissue, some of which showed tissue-specific expression. Twenty-three unique rice genes were identified to be feasible targets for seven rice miRNAs, including four members of Scarecrow-like transcription factor, the targets of miR-39 that had been characterized in Arabidopsis. Lacking long complementarity, the regulatory targets of 13 miRNAs remain to be further investigated. A possible mechanism of translational repressor for plant miRNAs that lack perfect complementarity to target mRNAs is discussed."

Here we report that 2'-O-methyl oligonucleotides can act as irreversible, stoichiometric inhibitors of small RNA function. We show that a 2'-O-methyl oligonucleotide complementary to an siRNA can block mRNA cleavage in Drosophila embryo lysates and HeLa cell S100 extracts and in cultured human HeLa cells. In Caenorhabditis elegans, injection of the 2'-O-methyl oligonucleotide complementary to the miRNA let-7 can induce a let-7 loss-of-function phenocopy. Using an immobilized 2'-O-methyl oligonucleotide, we show that the C. elegans Argonaute proteins ALG-1 and ALG-2, which were previously implicated in let-7 function through genetic studies, are constituents of a let-7-containing protein-RNA complex. Thus, we demonstrate that 2'-O-methyl RNA oligonucleotides can provide an efficient and straightforward way to block small RNA function in vivo and furthermore can be used to identify small RNA-associated proteins that mediate RNA silencing pathways."

        "title": "Genetic and functional diversification of small RNA pathways in plants.",
        "abstract": "Multicellular eukaryotes produce small RNA molecules (approximately 21-24 nucleotides) of two general types, microRNA (miRNA) and short interfering RNA (siRNA). They collectively function as sequence-specific guides to silence or regulate genes, transposons, and viruses and to modify chromatin and genome structure. Formation or activity of small RNAs requires factors belonging to gene families that encode DICER (or DICER-LIKE [DCL]) and ARGONAUTE proteins and, in the case of some siRNAs, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDR) proteins. Unlike many animals, plants encode multiple DCL and RDR proteins. Using a series of insertion mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana, unique functions for three DCL proteins in miRNA (DCL1), endogenous siRNA (DCL3), and viral siRNA (DCL2) biogenesis were identified. One RDR protein (RDR2) was required for all endogenous siRNAs analyzed. The loss of endogenous siRNA in dcl3 and rdr2 mutants was associated with loss of heterochromatic marks and increased transcript accumulation at some loci. Defects in siRNA-generation activity in response to turnip crinkle virus in dcl2 mutant plants correlated with increased virus susceptibility. We conclude that proliferation and diversification of DCL and RDR genes during evolution of plants contributed to specialization of small RNA-directed pathways for development, chromatin structure, and defense."

        "title": "miRNA-transcription factor interactions: a combinatorial regulation of gene expression.",
        "abstract": "Developmental processes require a precise spatio-temporal regulation of gene expression wherein a diverse set of transcription factors control the signalling pathways. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a class of small non-coding RNA molecules have recently drawn attention for their prominent role in development and disease. These tiny sequences are essential for regulation of processes, including cell signalling, cell development, cell death, cell proliferation, patterning and differentiation. The consequence of gene regulation by miRNAs is similar to that by transcription factors (TFs). A regulatory cascade essential for appropriate execution of several biological events is triggered through a combinatorial action of miRNAs and TFs. These two important regulators share similar regulatory logics and bring about a cooperative action in the gene regulatory network, dependent on the binding sites present on the target gene. The review addresses the biogenesis and nomenclature of miRNAs, outlines the mechanism of action and regulation of their expression, and focuses on the combinatorial action of miRNAs and TFs for the expression of genes in various regulatory cascades."

        "abstract": "Neurogenesis in the nervous system is regulated by both protein coding genes and non-coding RNA molecules. microRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small non-coding RNAs and usually negatively regulate gene expression by binding to the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of target messenger RNAs (mRNAs). miRNAs have been shown to play an essential role in neurogenesis, regulating neuronal proliferation, differentiation, maturation, and migration. An important strategy used to reveal miRNA function is the manipulation of their expression levels and patterns in specific regions and cell types in the nervous system. In this review we will systemically highlight established and new approaches used to achieve gain-of-function and loss-of-function of miRNAs in vitro and in vivo, and will also summarize miRNA delivery techniques. As the development of these leading edge techniques come online, more exciting discoveries of the roles miRNAs play in neural development and function will be uncovered."

        "abstract": "The putative RNA helicase, Armitage (Armi), is required to repress oskar translation in Drosophila oocytes; armi mutant females are sterile and armi mutations disrupt anteroposterior and dorsoventral patterning. Here, we show that armi is required for RNAi. armi mutant male germ cells fail to silence Stellate, a gene regulated endogenously by RNAi, and lysates from armi mutant ovaries are defective for RNAi in vitro. Native gel analysis of protein-siRNA complexes in wild-type and armi mutant ovary lysates suggests that armi mutants support early steps in the RNAi pathway but are defective in the production of active RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which mediates target RNA destruction in RNAi. Our results suggest that armi is required for RISC maturation."

        "abstract": "Posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS) in plants resuits from the degradation of mRNAs and shows phenomenological similarities with quelling in fungi and RNAi in animals. Here, we report the isolation of sgs2 and sgs3 Arabidopsis mutants impaired in PTGS. We establish a mechanistic link between PTGS, quelling, and RNAi since the Arabidopsis SGS2 protein is similar to an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase like N. crassa QDE-1, controlling quelling, and C. elegans EGO-1, controlling RNAi. In contrast, SGS3 shows no significant similarity with any known or putative protein, thus defining a specific step of PTGS in plants. Both sgs2 and sgs3 mutants show enhanced susceptibility to virus, definitively proving that PTGS is an antiviral defense mechanism that can also target transgene RNA for degradation."

        "abstract": "Posttranscriptional gene silencing is a defense mechanism in plants that is similar to quelling in fungi and RNA interference in animals. Here, we describe four genetic loci that are required for posttranscriptional gene silencing in Arabidopsis. One of these, SDE1, is a plant homolog of QDE-1 in Neurospora crassa that encodes an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The sde1 mutation was specific for posttranscriptional gene silencing induced by transgenes rather than by viruses. We propose that the role of SDE1 is to synthesize a double-stranded RNA initiator of posttranscriptional gene silencing. According to this idea, when a virus induces posttranscriptional gene silencing, the virus-encoded RNA polymerase would produce the double-stranded RNA and SDE1 would be redundant."

We therefore investigated whether microRNAs also have diagnostic utility by comparing levels of tumour-associated MIRN155 (miR-155), MIRN210 (miR-210) and MIRN21 (miR-21) in serum from diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients (n = 60) with healthy controls (n = 43). Levels were higher in patient than control sera (P = 0.009, 0.02 and 0.04 respectively). Moreover, high MIRN21 expression was associated with relapse-free survival (P = 0.05). This is the first description of circulating microRNAs and suggests that microRNAs have potential as non-invasive diagnostic markers for DLBCL and possibly other cancers."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) guide posttranscriptional repression of mRNAs. Hundreds of miRNAs have been identified but the target identification of mammalian mRNAs is still a difficult task due to a poor understanding of the interaction between miRNAs and the miRNA recognizing element (MRE). In recent research, the importance of the 5' end of the miRNA:MRE duplex has been emphasized and the effect of the tail region addressed, but the role of the central loop has largely remained unexplored. Here we examined the effect of the loop region in miRNA:MRE duplexes and found that the location of the central loop is one of the important factors affecting the efficiency of gene regulation mediated by miRNAs. It was further determined that the addition of a loop score combining both location and size as a new criterion for predicting MREs and their cognate miRNAs significantly decreased the false positive rates and increased the specificity of MRE prediction."

Increasing evidences from the literature show that miRNAs play a pivotal role in human tumorigenesis. Many studies have addressed the role of miRNAs in normal hematopoiesis, giving an interpretative key to the aberrancies of expression observed in human hematological malignancies. Moreover, the recent demonstration that other ncRNAs, the ultraconserved genes (UCGs) or transcribed ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs), are involved in human cancerogenesis, suggests that the wider family of ncRNAs (including both miRNAs and UCGs) could contribute to the development of the malignant phenotype. Here we review the main studies investigating the role of miRNAs and UCRs in both normal hemopoiesis and hematological malignancies, and identify the molecular, clinical and therapeutic implications of these recent findings."

Retroviral expression of miR-17-92 accelerates c-Myc-induced lymphoma development, but precisely how higher expression of miR-17-92 promotes lymphomagenesis remains unclear. Here we generated mice with higher expression of miR-17-92 in lymphocytes. These mice developed lymphoproliferative disease and autoimmunity and died prematurely. Lymphocytes from these mice showed more proliferation and less activation-induced cell death. The miR-17-92 miRNA suppressed expression of the tumor suppressor PTEN and the proapoptotic protein Bim. This mechanism probably contributed to the lymphoproliferative disease and autoimmunity of miR-17-92-transgenic mice and contributes to lymphoma development in patients with amplifications of the miR-17-92 coding region."

        "abstract": "Deregulation of E2F1 activity and resistance to TGFbeta are hallmarks of gastric cancer. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs frequently misregulated in human malignancies. Here we provide evidence that the miR-106b-25 cluster, upregulated in a subset of human gastric tumors, is activated by E2F1 in parallel with its host gene, Mcm7. In turn, miR-106b and miR-93 regulate E2F1 expression, establishing a miRNA-directed negative feedback loop. Furthermore, upregulation of these miRNAs impairs the TGFbeta tumor suppressor pathway, interfering with the expression of CDKN1A (p21(Waf1/Cip1)) and BCL2L11 (Bim). Together, these results suggest that the miR-106b-25 cluster is involved in E2F1 posttranscriptional regulation and may play a key role in the development of TGFbeta resistance in gastric cancer."

        "title": "Dicer ablation affects antibody diversity and cell survival in the B lymphocyte lineage.",
        "abstract": "To explore the role of Dicer-dependent control mechanisms in B lymphocyte development, we ablated this enzyme in early B cell progenitors. This resulted in a developmental block at the pro- to pre-B cell transition. Gene-expression profiling revealed a miR-17 approximately 92 signature in the 3'UTRs of genes upregulated in Dicer-deficient pro-B cells; a top miR-17 approximately 92 target, the proapoptotic molecule Bim, was highly upregulated. Accordingly, B cell development could be partially rescued by ablation of Bim or transgenic expression of the prosurvival protein Bcl-2. This allowed us to assess the impact of Dicer deficiency on the V(D)J recombination program in developing B cells. We found intact Ig gene rearrangements in immunoglobulin heavy (IgH) and kappa chain loci, but increased sterile transcription and usage of D(H) elements of the DSP family in IgH, and increased N sequence addition in Igkappa due to deregulated transcription of the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase gene."

        "abstract": "miR-17 approximately 92, miR-106b approximately 25, and miR-106a approximately 363 belong to a family of highly conserved miRNA clusters. Amplification and overexpression of miR-1792 is observed in human cancers, and its oncogenic properties have been confirmed in a mouse model of B cell lymphoma. Here we show that mice deficient for miR-17 approximately 92 die shortly after birth with lung hypoplasia and a ventricular septal defect. The miR-17 approximately 92 cluster is also essential for B cell development. Absence of miR-17 approximately 92 leads to increased levels of the proapoptotic protein Bim and inhibits B cell development at the pro-B to pre-B transition. Furthermore, while ablation of miR-106b approximately 25 or miR-106a approximately 363 has no obvious phenotypic consequences, compound mutant embryos lacking both miR-106b approximately 25 and miR-17 approximately 92 die at midgestation. These results provide key insights into the physiologic functions of this family of microRNAs and suggest a link between the oncogenic properties of miR-17 approximately 92 and its functions during B lymphopoiesis and lung development."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs represent a large family of non-coding small RNAs that function as the major endogenous triggers for RNA interference. Hundreds of microRNAs have been identified through small RNA cloning, bioinformatic predictions, and high-throughput pyrosequencing. They are believed to suppress gene expression through post-transcriptional regulation via either translational repression or mRNA turnover. Over one third of human genes are predicted targets for microRNAs. However, even after extensive studies, the function of microRNAs and the precise mechanism by which they suppress gene expression remain elusive. Although controversy remains, recent advances have shined new light on how microRNAs regulate their targets. A better understanding of the mechanism should facilitate studies of their function."

        "title": "DICER-LIKE2 plays a primary role in transitive silencing of transgenes in Arabidopsis.",
        "abstract": "Dicer-like (DCL) enzymes play a pivotal role in RNA silencing in plants, processing the long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) that triggers silencing into the primary short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that mediate it. The siRNA population can be augmented and silencing amplified via transitivity, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDR)-dependent pathway that uses the target RNA as substrate to generate secondary siRNAs. Here we report that Arabidopsis DCL2-but not DCL4-is required for transitivity in cell-autonomous, post-transcriptional silencing of transgenes. An insertion mutation in DCL2 blocked sense transgene-induced silencing and eliminated accumulation of the associated RDR-dependent siRNAs. In hairpin transgene-induced silencing, the dcl2 mutation likewise eliminated accumulation of secondary siRNAs and blocked transitive silencing, but did not block silencing mediated by primary siRNAs. Strikingly, in all cases, the dcl2 mutation eliminated accumulation of all secondary siRNAs, including those generated by other DCL enzymes. In contrast, mutations in DCL4 promoted a dramatic shift to transitive silencing in the case of the hairpin transgene and enhanced silencing induced by the sense transgene. Suppression of hairpin and sense transgene silencing by the P1/HC-Pro and P38 viral suppressors was associated with elimination of secondary siRNA accumulation, but the suppressors did not block processing of the stem of the hairpin transcript into primary siRNAs. Thus, these viral suppressors resemble the dcl2 mutation in their effects on siRNA biogenesis. We conclude that DCL2 plays an essential, as opposed to redundant, role in transitive silencing of transgenes and may play a more important role in silencing of viruses than currently thought."

Accordingly, this review provides an elementary roadmap to navigate among available tools for miRNA analysis. The most common problems and errors observed in miRNA research are also discussed."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are defined by their precise processing from a longer stem-loop precursor and by their subsequent ability to direct the regulation of target RNAs distinct from the miRNA precursor. Several lines of evidence suggest that miRNAs arose at least twice during eukaryotic evolution from an ancestral, pan-eukaryotic small RNA producing molecular machinery, though alternative scenarios cannot be ruled out. A handful of plant miRNAs are strongly expressed, widely conserved among plants, and have identical targets in long-diverged species; most of these very well conserved miRNA-target relationships involve DNA-binding transcription factors with suspected roles in developmental control. In contrast, a much greater number of plant miRNAs are weakly expressed, poorly conserved, and have few if any readily identifiable targets. These miRNAs appear to be evolutionarily \"transient\", and many of them may be of little to no selective value. However, this ever-changing cast of transient miRNAs could provide a reservoir of potentially useful miRNAs from which new regulatory interactions sometimes are selected."

        "abstract": "Argonaute (AGO) proteins recruit small RNAs to form the core of RNAi effector complexes. Arabidopsis encodes ten AGO proteins and a large network of small RNAs. How these small RNAs are sorted into specific AGO complexes remains largely unknown. We have cataloged small RNAs resident in four AGO complexes. We found that AGO2 and AGO4 preferentially recruit small RNAs with a 5' terminal adenosine, whereas AGO1 harbors microRNAs (miRNAs) that favor a 5' terminal uridine. AGO5 predominantly binds small RNAs that initiate with cytosine. Changing the 5' terminal nucleotide of an miRNA predictably redirected it into a different AGO complex and alters its biological activity. These results reveal a role for small RNA sequences in assorting among AGO complexes. This suggests that specialization of AGO complexes might involve remodeling the 5' end-binding pocket to accept certain small RNA sequences, perhaps explaining the evolutionary drive for miRNAs to initiate with uridine."

Here, we show that miR390-ARGONAUTE7 complexes function in distinct cleavage or noncleavage modes at two target sites in TAS3a transcripts. The AGO7 cleavage, but not the noncleavage, function could be provided by AGO1, the dominant miRNA-associated AGO, but only when AGO1 was guided to a modified target site through an alternate miRNA. AGO7 was highly selective for interaction with miR390, and miR390 in turn was excluded from association with AGO1 due entirely to an incompatible 5' adenosine. Analysis of AGO1, AGO2, and AGO7 revealed a potent 5' nucleotide discrimination function for some, although not all, ARGONAUTEs. miR390 and AGO7, therefore, evolved as a highly specific miRNA guide/effector protein pair to function at two distinct tasiRNA biogenesis steps."

        "title": "The mechanism selecting the guide strand from small RNA duplexes is different among argonaute proteins.",
        "abstract": "Double-stranded RNA induces RNA silencing and is cleaved into 21-24 nt small RNA duplexes by Dicer enzyme. A strand of Dicer-generated small RNA duplex (called the guide strand) is then selected by a thermodynamic mechanism to associate with Argonaute (AGO) protein. This AGO-small RNA complex functions to cleave mRNA, repress translation or modify chromatin structure in a sequence-specific manner. Although a model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, contains 10 AGO genes, their roles and molecular mechanisms remain obscure. In this study, we analyzed the roles of Arabidopsis AGO2 and AGO5. Interestingly, the 5' nucleotide of small RNAs that associated with AGO2 was mainly adenine (85.7%) and that with AGO5 was mainly cytosine (83.5%). Small RNAs that were abundantly cloned from the AGO2 immunoprecipitation fraction (miR163-LL, which is derived from the Lower Left of mature miR163 in pre-miR163, and miR390) and from the AGO5 immunoprecipitation fraction (miR163-UL, which is derived from the Upper Left of mature miR163 in pre-miR163, and miR390(*)) are derived from the single small RNA duplexes, miR163-LL/miR163-UL and miR390/miR390(*). Each strand of the miR163-LL/miR163-UL duplex is selectively sorted to associate with AGO2 or AGO5 in a 5' nucleotide-dependent manner rather than in a thermodynamic stability-dependent manner. Furthermore, we showed that both AGO2 and AGO5 have the ability to bind cucumber mosaic virus-derived small RNAs. These results clearly indicate that the mechanism selecting the guide strand is different among AGO proteins and that multiple AGO genes are involved in anti-virus defense in plants."

Lung cancer is the most prevalent form of cancer worldwide and lacks effective therapies. Here we have used both in vitro and in vivo approaches to show that the let-7 microRNA directly represses cancer growth in the lung. We find that let-7 inhibits the growth of multiple human lung cancer cell lines in culture, as well as the growth of lung cancer cell xenografts in immunodeficient mice. Using an established orthotopic mouse lung cancer model, we show that intranasal let-7 administration reduces tumor formation in vivo in the lungs of animals expressing a G12D activating mutation for the K-ras oncogene. These findings provide direct evidence that let-7 acts as a tumor suppressor gene in the lung and indicate that this miRNA may be useful as a novel therapeutic agent in lung cancer."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) silence gene expression by binding 3' untranslated regions of target mRNAs. Recent studies suggested silencing is achieved through either recruitment of eIF6, which prevents ribosome assembly, or displacement of eIF4E from the mRNA 5' cap structure. Using Drosophila melanogaster cells, we show that eIF6 is not required for silencing. In contrast, silencing is abolished by mutating Argonaute 1 (AGO1) at two conserved phenylalanine residues predicted to mediate binding to the cap structure. Notably, we found these mutations also prevented AGO1 from interacting with GW182 and miRNAs, indicating that the essential role of these residues is unrelated to cap binding. Consistently, depleting GW182 or overexpressing its AGO1 binding domain relieved silencing of all reporters tested, including those lacking a poly(A) tail. Together, our findings show that miRNA function is effected by AGO1-GW182 complexes and the role of GW182 in silencing goes beyond promoting deadenylation."

        "title": "microRNA involvement in human cancer.",
        "abstract": "When, \u223c20 years ago, investigators first determined that components of the genome considered nonfunctional had, in fact, gene regulatory capacity, they probably had no idea of their potential in controlling cell fate and were forced to revise and somehow reorganize their view of the molecular biology. Indeed, it is currently well documented how a class of small non-coding RNAs, microRNAs, are conserved among the species, expressed in different tissues and cell types and involved in almost every biological process, including cell cycle, growth, apoptosis, differentiation and stress response, exerting a finely tuned regulation of gene expression by targeting multiple molecules. As a consequence of the widespread range of processes they are able to influence, it is not surprising that miRNA deregulation is a hallmark of several pathological conditions, including cancer. Indeed, the aberrant expression of these tiny molecules in human tumors is not just a casual association, but they can exert a causal role, as oncogenes or tumor suppressors, in different steps of the tumorigenic process, from initiation and development to progression toward the acquisition of a metastatic phenotype. An increasing body of evidence has indeed proved the importance of miRNAs in cancer, suggesting their possible use as diagnostic, prognostic and predictive biomarkers and leading to exploit miRNA-based anticancer therapies, either alone or in combination with current targeted therapies, with the goal to improve disease response and increase cure rates. Here, we review our current knowledge about miRNA involvement in cancer."

Because translation, deadenylation, and decay are closely linked processes, it is important to establish their ordering and thus to define the molecular mechanism of silencing. We have investigated the kinetics of these events in miRNA-mediated gene silencing by using a Drosophila S2 cell-based controllable expression system and show that mRNAs with both natural and engineered 3' untranslated regions with miRNA target sites are first subject to translational inhibition, followed by effects on deadenylation and decay. We next used a natural translational elongation stall to show that miRNA-mediated silencing inhibits translation at an early step, potentially translation initiation."

        "abstract": "Assembly of microRNA ribonucleoproteins (miRNPs) or RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISCs) is essential for the function of miRNAs and initiates from processing of precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) by Dicer or by Ago2. Here, we report an in\u00a0vitro miRNP/RISC assembly assay programmed by pre-miRNAs from mammalian cell lysates. Combining in\u00a0vivo studies in Dicer Knockout cells reconstituted with wild-type or catalytically inactive Dicer, we find that the miRNA loading complex (miRLC) is the primary machinery linking pre-miRNA processing to\u00a0miRNA loading. We show that a miRNA precursor deposit complex (miPDC) plays a crucial role in Dicer-independent miRNA biogenesis and promotes\u00a0miRNP assembly of certain Dicer-dependent miRNAs. Furthermore, we find that 5'-uridine, 3'-mid base pairing, and 5'-mid mismatches within pre-miRNAs promote their assembly into miPDC. Our studies provide a comprehensive view of miRNP/RISC assembly pathways in mammals, and our assay provides a versatile platform for further mechanistic dissection of such pathways in mammals."

        "abstract": "Arabidopsis thaliana defense against distinct positive-strand RNA viruses requires production of virus-derived secondary small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) by multiple RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. However, little is known about the biogenesis pathway and effector mechanism of viral secondary siRNAs. Here, we describe a mutant of Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV-\u03942b) that is silenced predominantly by the RNA-DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASE6 (RDR6)-dependent viral secondary siRNA pathway. We show that production of the viral secondary siRNAs targeting CMV-\u03942b requires SUPPRESSOR OF GENE SILENCING3 and DICER-LIKE4 (DCL4) in addition to RDR6. Examination of 25 single, double, and triple mutants impaired in nine ARGONAUTE (AGO) genes combined with coimmunoprecipitation and deep sequencing identifies an essential function for AGO1 and AGO2 in defense against CMV-\u03942b, which act downstream the biogenesis of viral secondary siRNAs in a nonredundant and cooperative manner. Our findings also illustrate that dicing of the viral RNA precursors of primary and secondary siRNA is insufficient to confer virus resistance. Notably, although DCL2 is able to produce abundant viral secondary siRNAs in the absence of DCL4, the resultant 22-nucleotide viral siRNAs alone do not guide efficient silencing of CMV-\u03942b. Possible mechanisms for the observed qualitative difference in RNA silencing between 21- and 22-nucleotide secondary siRNAs are discussed."

        "title": "MicroRNAs, the DNA damage response and cancer.",
        "abstract": "Many carcinogenic agents such as ultra-violet light from the sun and various natural and man-made chemicals act by damaging the DNA. To deal with these potentially detrimental effects of DNA damage, cells induce a complex DNA damage response (DDR) that includes DNA repair, cell cycle checkpoints, damage tolerance systems and apoptosis. This DDR is a potent barrier against carcinogenesis and defects within this response are observed in many, if not all, human tumors. DDR defects fuel the evolution of precancerous cells to malignant tumors, but can also induce sensitivity to DNA damaging agents in cancer cells, which can be therapeutically exploited by the use of DNA damaging treatment modalities. Regulation of and coordination between sub-pathways within the DDR is important for maintaining genome stability. Although regulation of the DDR has been extensively studied at the transcriptional and post-translational level, less is known about post-transcriptional gene regulation by microRNAs, the topic of this review. More specifically, we highlight current knowledge about DNA damage responsive microRNAs and microRNAs that regulate DNA damage response genes. We end by discussing the role of DNA damage response microRNAs in cancer etiology and sensitivity to ionizing radiation and other DNA damaging therapeutic agents."

        "abstract": "Breast cancer is considered as a heterogeneous disease comprising various types of neoplasms, which involves different profile changes in both mRNA and micro-RNA (miRNA) expression. Extensive studies on mRNA expression in breast tumor have yielded some very interesting findings, some of which have been validated and used in clinic. Recent miRNA research advances showed great potential for the development of novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets. miRNAs are a new class of small non-coding regulatory RNAs that are involved in regulating gene expression at the posttranscriptional level. It has been demonstrated that miRNA expression is frequently deregulated in breast cancer, which warrants further in-depth investigation to decipher their precise regulatory role in tumorigenesis. We address briefly the regulatory mechanism of miRNA, the expression of miRNAs in tumorigenesis, and their potential use as breast cancer biomarkers for early disease diagnosis and prognosis. In addition, we discuss the use of the Formalin-Fixed, Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) tissue as an invaluable source for breast cancer biomarker discovery and validation, and the potential use of circulating miRNAs in blood for early breast cancer detection. We envision the potential use of miRNAs in breast cancer management in the near future, particularly in improving the early diagnosis, prognosis and treatment."

        "abstract": "Duplexes of 21-23 nucleotide (nt) RNAs are the sequence-specific mediators of RNA interference (RNAi) and post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS). Synthetic, short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were examined in Drosophila melanogaster embryo lysate for their requirements regarding length, structure, chemical composition and sequence in order to mediate efficient RNAi. Duplexes of 21 nt siRNAs with 2 nt 3' overhangs were the most efficient triggers of sequence-specific mRNA degradation. Substitution of one or both siRNA strands by 2'-deoxy or 2'-O-methyl oligonucleotides abolished RNAi, although multiple 2'-deoxynucleotide substitutions at the 3' end of siRNAs were tolerated. The target recognition process is highly sequence specific, but not all positions of a siRNA contribute equally to target recognition; mismatches in the centre of the siRNA duplex prevent target RNA cleavage. The position of the cleavage site in the target RNA is defined by the 5' end of the guide siRNA rather than its 3' end. These results provide a rational basis for the design of siRNAs in future gene targeting experiments."

Here we show, in mammalian tissue culture, that a short interfering RNA (siRNA) can repress expression of a target mRNA with partially complementary binding sites in its 3' UTR, much like the demonstrated function of endogenously encoded microRNAs (miRNAs). The mechanism for this repression is cooperative, distinct from the catalytic mechanism of mRNA cleavage by siRNAs. The use of siRNAs to study translational repression holds promise for dissecting the sequence and structural determinants and general mechanism of gene repression by miRNAs."

        "abstract": "Loss-of-function mutations of HASTY (HST) affect many different processes in Arabidopsis development. In addition to reducing the size of both roots and lateral organs of the shoot, hst mutations affect the size of the shoot apical meristem, accelerate vegetative phase change, delay floral induction under short days, adaxialize leaves and carpels, disrupt the phyllotaxis of the inflorescence, and reduce fertility. Double mutant analysis suggests that HST acts in parallel to SQUINT in the regulation of phase change and in parallel to KANADI in the regulation of leaf polarity. Positional cloning demonstrated that HST is the Arabidopsis ortholog of the importin beta-like nucleocytoplasmic transport receptors exportin 5 in mammals and MSN5 in yeast. Consistent with a potential role in nucleocytoplasmic transport, we found that HST interacts with RAN1 in a yeast two-hybrid assay and that a HST-GUS fusion protein is located at the periphery of the nucleus. HST is one of at least 17 members of the importin-beta family in Arabidopsis and is the first member of this family shown to have an essential function in plants. The hst loss-of-function phenotype suggests that this protein regulates the nucleocytoplasmic transport of molecules involved in several different morphogenetic pathways, as well as molecules generally required for root and shoot growth."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that typically inhibit the translation and stability of messenger RNAs (mRNAs), controlling genes involved in cellular processes such as inflammation, cell-cycle regulation, stress response, differentiation, apoptosis, and migration. Thus, miRNAs have been implicated in the regulation of virtually all signaling circuits within a cell, and their dysregulation has been shown to play an essential role in the development and progression of cancer. Here, after a brief description of miRNA genomics, biogenesis, and function, we discuss the effects of miRNA dysregulation in the cellular pathways that lead to the progressive conversion of normal cells into cancer cells and the potential to develop new molecular miRNA-targeted therapies."

In this review we provide an overview of both lentiviral vectors and RNA silencing along with design considerations for generating lentiviral vectors capable of RNA silencing. We go on to describe the current preclinical data regarding lentiviral vector-mediated RNA silencing for CNS disorders and discuss the concerns of side effects associated with lentiviral vectors and small interfering RNAs and how these might be mitigated."

        "abstract": "miRNAs elicit gene silencing at the post-transcriptional level by several modes of action: translational repression, mRNA decay, and mRNA cleavage. Studies in animals have suggested that translational repression occurs at early steps of translation initiation, which can be followed by deadenylation and mRNA decay. Plant miRNAs were originally thought to solely participate in mRNA cleavage, but increasing evidence has indicated that they are also commonly involved in translational inhibition. Here we discuss recent findings on miRNA-mediated translational repression in plants. The identification of AMP1 in Arabidopsis as a protein required for the translational repression but not the mRNA cleavage activity of miRNAs links miRNA-based translational repression to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Future work is required to further elucidate the miRNA machinery on the ER."

However, passenger strands also emerge as active microRNAs. It is unknown whether the guide-to-passenger-strand ratio can be actively regulated and which factors influence strand incorporation into the RISC. Here, we identify a microRNA with a variable guide-to-passenger-strand ratio along with its regulatory factor: Human Argonaute-3 specifically enhances the passenger strand expression and activity of the tumor suppressor microRNA let-7a. This post-maturational effect is mediated by the Ago3 PAZ and MID domains yielding an elevated affinity for let-7a-3p. Notably, this is independent of the 5'-terminal basepair stability, challenging the universality of the respective rule for microRNA strand selection. Thus, this study uncovers the first protein regulator of the ratio between microRNA guide and passenger strand expression and activity."

In plants, microRNA (miRNA) and small interfering RNA (siRNA) represent two major types of small RNA molecules which play pivotal roles in plant developmental control and antiviral defences. To escape these plant defences, plant viruses have encoded a vast array of viral suppressors of RNA silencing (VSRs) to attack the host antiviral silencing pathway by interfering with small RNA processing, RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) assembly, viral mRNA cleavage etc. Transgenic plants expressing distinct VSRs often show developmental aberrations that resemble the phenotype of miRNA-deficient mutants, implying a potential intrinsic link between VSRs and the miRNA pathway (at least in Arabidopsis thaliana) even though their pathogenic mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this review, we summarise our current structural understandings of the arms race between the host and virus along the RNA silencing pathway in A. thaliana by focusing on several important ribonucleoprotein (RNP) structures involved in RNA silencing and unique structural features adopted by VSRs."

        "abstract": "Leaf development entails the transition from a small group of undifferentiated cells to a structure of defined size and shape, highly organized into different cell types with specialized functions. During this developmental sequence, patterning, growth, and differentiation have to be tightly coordinated by intricate regulatory networks in which small RNAs [microRNAs (miRNAs) and trans-acting small interfering RNAs (ta-siRNAs)] have emerged during the last years as essential players. In this review, after having given an overview of miRNA and ta-siRNA biogenesis and mode of action, their contribution to the life of a leaf from initiation to senescence is described. MiRNA and ta-siRNA are not merely regulators of gene expression patterns, but, by acting both locally and at the whole organ scale, they have an essential role in the coordination of complex developmental processes and are fully integrated in genetic networks and signalling pathways."

Now, studies of miRNAs are resolving some unsolved issues in immunology. Recent studies have shown that miRNAs have unique expression profiles in cells of the innate and adaptive immune systems and have pivotal roles in the regulation of both cell development and function. Furthermore, when miRNAs are aberrantly expressed they can contribute to pathological conditions involving the immune system, such as cancer and autoimmunity; they have also been shown to be useful as diagnostic and prognostic indicators of disease type and severity. This Review discusses recent advances in our understanding of both the intended functions of miRNAs in managing immune cell biology and their pathological roles when their expression is dysregulated."

We report that a large fraction of genomic ultraconserved regions (UCRs) encode a particular set of ncRNAs whose expression is altered in human cancers. Genome-wide profiling revealed that UCRs have distinct signatures in human leukemias and carcinomas. UCRs are frequently located at fragile sites and genomic regions involved in cancers. We identified certain UCRs whose expression may be regulated by microRNAs abnormally expressed in human chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and we proved that the inhibition of an overexpressed UCR induces apoptosis in colon cancer cells. Our findings argue that ncRNAs and interaction between noncoding genes are involved in tumorigenesis to a greater extent than previously thought."

        "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer is a disease with an extremely poor prognosis. Tumor protein 53-induced nuclear protein 1 (TP53INP1) is a proapoptotic stress-induced p53 target gene. In this article, we show by immunohistochemical analysis that TP53INP1 expression is dramatically reduced in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and this decrease occurs early during pancreatic cancer development. TP53INP1 reexpression in the pancreatic cancer-derived cell line MiaPaCa2 strongly reduced its capacity to form s.c., i.p., and intrapancreatic tumors in nude mice. This anti-tumoral capacity is, at least in part, due to the induction of caspase 3-mediated apoptosis. In addition, TP53INP1(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) transformed with a retrovirus expressing E1A/ras(V12) oncoproteins developed bigger tumors than TP53INP1(+/+) transformed MEFs or TP53INP1(-/-) transformed MEFs with restored TP53INP1 expression. Finally, TP53INP1 expression is repressed by the oncogenic micro RNA miR-155, which is overexpressed in PDAC cells. TP53INP1 is a previously unknown miR-155 target presenting anti-tumoral activity."

        "title": "Modulation of miR-155 and miR-125b levels following lipopolysaccharide/TNF-alpha stimulation and their possible roles in regulating the response to endotoxin shock.",
        "abstract": "We report here that miR-155 and miR-125b play a role in innate immune response. LPS stimulation of mouse Raw 264.7 macrophages resulted in the up-regulation of miR-155 and down-regulation of miR-125b levels. The same changes also occurred when C57BL/6 mice were i.p. injected with LPS. Furthermore, the levels of miR-155 and miR-125b in Raw 264.7 cells displayed oscillatory changes in response to TNF-alpha. These changes were impaired by pretreating the cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132, suggesting that these two microRNAs (miRNAs) may be at least transiently under the direct control of NF-kappaB transcriptional activity. We show that miR-155 most probably directly targets transcript coding for several proteins involved in LPS signaling such as the Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD), IkappaB kinase epsilon (IKKepsilon), and the receptor (TNFR superfamily)-interacting serine-threonine kinase 1 (Ripk1) while enhancing TNF-alpha translation. In contrast, miR-125b targets the 3'-untranslated region of TNF-alpha transcripts; therefore, its down-regulation in response to LPS may be required for proper TNF-alpha production. Finally, Emu-miR-155 transgenic mice produced higher levels of TNF-alpha when exposed to LPS and were hypersensitive to LPS/d-galactosamine-induced septic shock. Altogether, our data suggest that the LPS/TNF-alpha-dependent regulation of miR-155 and miR-125b may be implicated in the response to endotoxin shock, thus offering new targets for drug design."

        "abstract": "Several recent studies have found a conserved microRNA (miRNA) family, the miR-34s, to be direct transcriptional targets of p53. miR-34 activation can recapitulate elements of p53 activity, including induction of cell-cycle arrest and promotion of apoptosis, and loss of miR-34 can impair p53-mediated cell death. These data reinforce the growing awareness that non-coding RNAs are key players in tumour development by placing miRNAs in a central role in a well-known tumour-suppressor network."

        "abstract": "Apoptosis is a well-orchestrated cellular mechanism that balances the effects of cell proliferation and cell death. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to control cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis; and can be significantly deregulated in many cancers types. In fact, the ability to evade apoptosis is a hallmark of tumorigenesis. Although the role of miRNAs in the regulation of apoptosis is not fully understood, the recent influx of data strongly suggests that miRNAs play a significant role in regulating programmed cell death, or apoptosis. The genes involved in apoptotic pathways can be broadly classified as pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic. Many of these apoptotic genes, irrespective of their positive or negative functional role in apoptosis, are regulated by miRNAs. In this review, we discuss the emerging role of miRNA-mediated gene networks in the control of apoptosis."

We used mRNA expression profiling to classify the breast tumors as luminal A, luminal B, basal-like, HER2+ and normal-like. A number of miRNAs are differentially expressed between these molecular tumor subtypes and individual miRNAs are associated with clinicopathological factors. Furthermore, we find that miRNAs could classify basal versus luminal tumor subtypes in an independent data set. In some cases, changes in miRNA expression correlate with genomic loss or gain; in others, changes in miRNA expression are likely due to changes in primary transcription and or miRNA biogenesis. Finally, the expression of DICER1 and AGO2 is correlated with tumor subtype and may explain some of the changes in miRNA expression observed."

A top predicted target of miR-150 is c-Myb, a transcription factor controlling multiple steps of lymphocyte development. Combining loss- and gain-of-function gene targeting approaches for miR-150 with conditional and partial ablation of c-Myb, we show that miR-150 indeed controls c-Myb expression in vivo in a dose-dependent manner over a narrow range of miRNA and c-Myb concentrations and that this dramatically affects lymphocyte development and response. Our results identify a key transcription factor as a critical target of a stage-specifically expressed miRNA in lymphocytes and suggest that this and perhaps other miRNAs have evolved to control the expression of just a few critical target proteins in particular cellular contexts."

However, little is known about the role that miRNAs play in the development and pathogenesis of lung diseases. Murine models of disease suggest that the loss of specific miRNAs is vital to lung development and modulation of the immune system that consequently results in the development of uncontrolled inflammation in the lung. Other studies have found that bacterial challenges also upregulate the expression of specific miRNAs. In this article, we will focus on miRNA involvement in lung development and the possibility that dysregulation and/or reactivation of miRNAs may contribute to lung disease. We will also review the role of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of specific diseases, such as lung cancer, sepsis and smoking-related lung disease."

        "title": "Emerging roles of microRNAs in the control of embryonic stem cells and the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells.",
        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as critical regulators of gene expression. These small, non-coding RNAs are believed to regulate more than a third of all protein coding genes, and they have been implicated in the control of virtually all biological processes, including the biology of stem cells. The essential roles of miRNAs in the control of pluripotent stem cells were clearly established by the finding that embryonic stem (ES) cells lacking proteins required for miRNA biogenesis exhibit defects in proliferation and differentiation. Subsequently, the function of numerous miRNAs has been shown to control the fate of ES cells and to directly influence critical gene regulatory networks controlled by pluripotency factors Sox2, Oct4, and Nanog. Moreover, a growing list of tissue-specific miRNAs, which are silenced or not processed fully in ES cells, has been found to promote differentiation upon their expression and proper processing. The importance of miRNAs for ES cells is further indicated by the exciting discovery that specific miRNA mimics or miRNA inhibitors promote the reprogramming of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. Although some progress has been made during the past two years in our understanding of the contribution of specific miRNAs during reprogramming, further progress is needed since it is highly likely that miRNAs play even wider roles in the generation of iPS cells than currently appreciated. This review examines recent developments related to the roles of miRNAs in the biology of pluripotent stem cells. In addition, we posit that more than a dozen additional miRNAs are excellent candidates for influencing the generation of iPS cells as well as for providing new insights into the process of reprogramming."

        "title": "miRNA profiling of na\u00efve, effector and memory CD8 T cells.",
        "abstract": "microRNAs have recently emerged as master regulators of gene expression during development and cell differentiation. Although profound changes in gene expression also occur during antigen-induced T cell differentiation, the role of miRNAs in the process is not known. We compared the miRNA expression profiles between antigen-specific na\u00efve, effector and memory CD8+ T cells using 3 different methods--small RNA cloning, miRNA microarray analysis and real-time PCR. Although many miRNAs were expressed in all the T cell subsets, the frequency of 7 miRNAs (miR-16, miR-21, miR-142-3p, miR-142-5p, miR-150, miR-15b and let-7f) alone accounted for approximately 60% of all miRNAs, and their expression was several fold higher than the other expressed miRNAs. Global downregulation of miRNAs (including 6/7 dominantly expressed miRNAs) was observed in effector T cells compared to na\u00efve cells and the miRNA expression levels tended to come back up in memory T cells. However, a few miRNAs, notably miR-21 were higher in effector and memory T cells compared to na\u00efve T cells. These results suggest that concomitant with profound changes in gene expression, miRNA profile also changes dynamically during T cell differentiation. Sequence analysis of the cloned mature miRNAs revealed an extensive degree of end polymorphism. While 3'end polymorphisms dominated, heterogeneity at both ends, resembling drosha/dicer processing shift was also seen in miR-142, suggesting a possible novel mechanism to generate new miRNA and/or to diversify miRNA target selection. Overall, our results suggest that dynamic changes in the expression of miRNAs may be important for the regulation of gene expression during antigen-induced T cell differentiation. Our study also suggests possible novel mechanisms for miRNA biogenesis and function."

It is now clear that miRNAs represent a class of genes with a great potential for use in diagnosis, prognosis and therapy. In this review we will focus on the discoveries that elucidate their crucial role in mammalian diseases, particularly in cancer, and propose that miRNA-based gene therapy might become the potential technology of choice in a wide range of human diseases including cancer."

A comprehensive proteomic analysis of Ago-containing mRNPs identified a large number of proteins involved in RNA metabolism. By using co-immunoprecipitation experiments followed by RNase treatment, we biochemically mapped interactions within Ago mRNPs.

        "abstract": "Two forms of RNA Polymerase IV (PolIVa/PolIVb) have been implicated in RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) in Arabidopsis. Prevailing models imply a distinct function for PolIVb by association of Argonaute4 (AGO4) with the C-terminal domain (CTD) of its largest subunit NRPD1b. Here we show that the extended CTD of NRPD1b-type proteins exhibits conserved Argonaute-binding capacity through a WG/GW-rich region that functionally distinguishes Pol IVb from Pol IVa, and that is essential for RdDM. Site-specific mutagenesis and domain-swapping experiments between AtNRPD1b and the human protein GW182 demonstrated that reiterated WG/GW motifs form evolutionarily and functionally conserved Argonaute-binding platforms in RNA interference (RNAi)-related components."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that act as post-transcriptional repressors of gene expression in organisms ranging from plants to humans. A widespread role for miRNAs in diverse molecular processes driving the initiation and progression of various tumor types has recently been described. Here, we discuss the etiology of the aberrant expression of miRNAs in human cancers and their role in tumor metastasis, which might define miRNAs as oncogenes or tumor suppressors. Moreover, we highlight the genomic/epigenetic alterations and transcriptional/post-transcriptional mechanisms associated with the misexpression of miRNAs in cancer. A better understanding of miRNA biology might ultimately yield further insight into the molecular mechanisms of tumorigenesis and new therapeutic strategies against cancer."

        "title": "Structural basis for 5'-nucleotide base-specific recognition of guide RNA by human AGO2.",
        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) mediate post-transcriptional gene regulation through association with Argonaute proteins (AGOs). Crystal structures of archaeal and bacterial homologues of AGOs have shown that the MID (middle) domain mediates the interaction with the phosphorylated 5' end of the miRNA guide strand and this interaction is thought to be independent of the identity of the 5' nucleotide in these systems. However, analysis of the known sequences of eukaryotic miRNAs and co-immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that there is a clear bias for U or A at the 5' position. Here we report the crystal structure of a MID domain from a eukaryotic AGO protein, human AGO2. The structure, in complex with nucleoside monophosphates (AMP, CMP, GMP, and UMP) mimicking the 5' end of miRNAs, shows that there are specific contacts made between the base of UMP or AMP and a rigid loop in the MID domain. Notably, the structure of the loop discriminates against CMP and GMP and dissociation constants calculated from NMR titration experiments confirm these results, showing that AMP (0.26 mM) and UMP (0.12 mM) bind with up to 30-fold higher affinity than either CMP (3.6 mM) or GMP (3.3 mM). This study provides structural evidence for nucleotide-specific interactions in the MID domain of eukaryotic AGO proteins and explains the observed preference for U or A at the 5' end of miRNAs."

Unique miRNA signatures of various inherited, metabolic, infectious, and neoplastic diseases have added a new dimension to the studies that look at their pathogenesis and highlight their potential to be reliable biomarkers. Also, altering miRNA functionality and the development of novel in vivo delivery systems to achieve targeted modulation of specific miRNA function are being actively pursued as novel approaches for therapeutic intervention in many diseases. Here we review the current body of knowledge on the role of miRNAs in development and disease and discuss future implications."

        "abstract": "The heterochronic genes lin-4, lin-14, lin-28, and lin-29 control the timing of specific postembryonic developmental events in C. elegans. The experiments described here examine how these four genes interact to control a particular stage-specific event of the lateral hypodermal cell lineages. This event, termed the \"larva-to-adult switch\" (L/A switch), involves several coordinate changes in the behavior of hypodermal cells at the fourth molt: cessation of cell division, formation of adult (instead of larval) cuticle, cell fusion, and cessation of the molting cycle. The phenotypes of multiply mutant strains suggest a model wherein the L/A switch is controlled by the stage-specific activity of a regulatory hierarchy: At early stages of wild-type development, lin-14 and lin-28 inhibit lin-29 and thus prevent switching. Later, lin-4 inhibits lin-14 and lin-28, allowing activation of lin-29, which in turn triggers the switch in the L4 stage. lin-29 may activate the L/A switch by regulating genes that control cell division, differentiation, and stage-specific gene expression in hypodermal cells."

        "abstract": "The recent discovery of microRNAs (miRNAs) in unicellular eukaryotes, including miRNAs known previously only from animals or plants, implies that miRNAs have a deep evolutionary history among eukaryotes. This contrasts with the prevailing view that miRNAs evolved convergently in animals and plants. We re-evaluate the evidence and find that none of the 73 plant and animal miRNAs described from protists meet the required criteria for miRNA annotation and, by implication, animals and plants did not acquire any of their respective miRNA genes from the crown ancestor of eukaryotes. Furthermore, of the 159 novel miRNAs previously identified among the seven species of unicellular protists examined, only 28 from the algae Ectocarpus and Chlamydomonas, meet the criteria for miRNA annotation. Therefore, at present only five groups of eukaryotes are known to possess miRNAs, indicating that miRNAs have evolved independently within eukaryotes through exaptation of their shared inherited RNAi machinery."

        "abstract": "Canonical microRNA biogenesis requires the Microprocessor components, Drosha and DGCR8, to generate precursor-miRNA, and Dicer to form mature miRNA. The Microprocessor is not required for processing of some miRNAs, including mirtrons, in which spliceosome-excised introns are direct Dicer substrates. In this study, we examine the processing of putative human mirtrons and demonstrate that although some are splicing-dependent, as expected, the predicted mirtrons, miR-1225 and miR-1228, are produced in the absence of splicing. Remarkably, knockout cell lines and knockdown experiments demonstrated that biogenesis of these splicing-independent mirtron-like miRNAs, termed 'simtrons', does not require the canonical miRNA biogenesis components, DGCR8, Dicer, Exportin-5 or Argonaute 2. However, simtron biogenesis was reduced by expression of a dominant negative form of Drosha. Simtrons are bound by Drosha and processed in vitro in a Drosha-dependent manner. Both simtrons and mirtrons function in silencing of target transcripts and are found in the RISC complex as demonstrated by their interaction with Argonaute proteins. These findings reveal a non-canonical miRNA biogenesis pathway that can produce functional regulatory RNAs."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) form a large class of non-coding RNAs that function in repression of gene expression in eukaryotes. By recognizing short stretches of nucleotides within the untranslated regions of mRNAs, miRNAs recruit partner proteins to individual transcripts, leading to mRNA cleavage or hindering of translation. Bioinformatic predictions and a wealth of data from wet laboratory studies indicate that miRNAs control expression of a large proportion of protein-coding genes, implying involvement of miRNAs in regulation of most biologic processes. In this review we discuss the biology of miRNAs and present examples of how manipulation of miRNA expression or activity can be exploited to attain the desired phenotypic traits in cell engineering as well as achieve therapeutic outcomes in treatment of a diverse set of diseases."

        "abstract": "A microRNA (miRNA) is a 21-24 nucleotide RNA product of a non-protein-coding gene. Plants, like animals, have a large number of miRNA-encoding genes in their genomes. The biogenesis of miRNAs in Arabidopsis is similar to that in animals in that miRNAs are processed from primary precursors by at least two steps mediated by RNAse III-like enzymes and that the miRNAs are incorporated into a protein complex named RISC. However, the biogenesis of plant miRNAs consists of an additional step, i.e., the miRNAs are methylated on the ribose of the last nucleotide by the miRNA methyltransferase HEN1. The high degree of sequence complementarity between plant miRNAs and their target mRNAs has facilitated the bioinformatic prediction of miRNA targets, many of which have been subsequently validated. Plant miRNAs have been predicted or confirmed to regulate a variety of processes, such as development, metabolism, and stress responses. A large category of miRNA targets consists of genes encoding transcription factors that play important roles in patterning the plant form."

        "abstract": "In a similar fashion to transcription factors, non-coding RNAs can be essential regulators of gene expression. The largest class of non-coding RNAs is the microRNAs. These approximately 22 nt double-stranded RNA molecules can repress translation or target mRNA degradation. There has been a surge of research in the past year stimulated by the recent availability of specialized techniques, both in vitro and in silico, for predicting and characterizing microRNAs. The accumulating evidence suggests that microRNAs are ubiquitous regulators of gene expression during development. The combined actions of microRNAs and transcription factors are able to tune the expression of proteins on a global level in a manner that cannot be achieved by transcription factors alone."

Here, we demonstrate that miR-15a and miR-16-1 expression is inversely correlated to Bcl2 expression in CLL and that both microRNAs negatively regulate Bcl2 at a posttranscriptional level. BCL2 repression by these microRNAs induces apoptopsis in a leukemic cell line model.

        "abstract": "Although hundreds of evolutionarily conserved microRNAs have been discovered, the functions of most remain unknown. Here, we describe the embryonic spatiotemporal expression profile, transcriptional regulation, and loss-of-function phenotype of Drosophila miR-1 (DmiR-1). DmiR-1 RNA is highly expressed throughout the mesoderm of early embryos and subsequently in somatic, visceral, and pharyngeal muscles, and the dorsal vessel. The expression of DmiR-1 is controlled by the Twist and Mef2 transcription factors. DmiR-1KO mutants, generated using ends-in gene targeting, die as small, immobilized second instar larvae with severely deformed musculature. This lethality is rescued when a DmiR-1 transgene is expressed specifically in the mesoderm and muscle. Strikingly, feeding triggers DmiR-1KO-associated paralysis and death; starved first instar DmiR-1KO larvae are essentially normal. Thus, DmiR-1 is not required for the formation or physiological function of the larval musculature, but is required for the dramatic post-mitotic growth of larval muscle."

        "abstract": "In eukaryotic cells degradation of bulk mRNA in the 5' to 3' direction requires the consecutive action of the decapping complex (consisting of DCP1 and DCP2) and the 5' to 3' exonuclease XRN1. These enzymes are found in discrete cytoplasmic foci known as P-bodies or GW-bodies (because of the accumulation of the GW182 antigen). Proteins acting in other post-transcriptional processes have also been localized to P-bodies. These include SMG5, SMG7, and UPF1, which function in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), and the Argonaute proteins that are essential for RNA interference (RNAi) and the micro-RNA (miRNA) pathway. In addition, XRN1 is required for degradation of mRNAs targeted by NMD and RNAi. To investigate a possible interplay between P-bodies and these post-transcriptional processes we depleted P-body or essential pathway components from Drosophila cells and analyzed the effects of these depletions on the expression of reporter constructs, allowing us to monitor specifically NMD, RNAi, or miRNA function. We show that the RNA-binding protein GW182 and the DCP1:DCP2 decapping complex are required for miRNA-mediated gene silencing, uncovering a crucial role for P-body components in the miRNA pathway. Our analysis also revealed that inhibition of one pathway by depletion of its key effectors does not prevent the functioning of the other pathways, suggesting a lack of interdependence in Drosophila."

Rheumatoid arthritis serves an example of a chronic inflammatory disorder in which miRNAs modulate the inflammatory process in the joints, with the potential to serve as biomarkers for both the inflammatory process and the potential for therapeutic response. This review discusses the investigations that led to miRNA discovery, miRNA biogenesis and mode of action, and the diverse roles of miRNAs in modulating the immune and inflammatory responses. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of miRNA biology in rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune disorders."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an abundant class of small non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) that function to regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Although their functions were originally described during normal development, miRNAs have emerged as integral components of the oncogenic and tumor suppressor network, regulating nearly all cellular processes altered during tumor formation. In particular, mir-17-92, a miRNA polycistron also known as oncomir-1, is among the most potent oncogenic miRNAs. Genomic amplification and elevated expression of mir-17-92 were both found in several human B-cell lymphomas, and its enforced expression exhibits strong tumorigenic activity in multiple mouse tumor models. mir-17-92 carries out pleiotropic functions during both normal development and malignant transformation, as it acts to promote proliferation, inhibit differentiation, increase angiogenesis, and sustain cell survival. Unlike most protein coding genes, mir-17-92 is a polycistronic miRNA cluster that contains multiple miRNA components, each of which has a potential to regulate hundreds of target mRNAs. This unique gene structure of mir-17-92 may underlie the molecular basis for its pleiotropic functions in a cell type- and context-dependent manner. Here we review the recent literature on the functional studies of mir-17-92 and highlight its potential impacts on the oncogene network. These findings on mir-17-92 indicate that miRNAs are integrated components of the molecular pathways that regulate tumor development and tumor maintenance."

        "title": "Small RNAs in the animal gonad: guarding genomes and guiding development.",
        "abstract": "Germ cells must safeguard, apportion, package, and deliver their genomes with exquisite precision to ensure proper reproduction and embryonic development. Classical genetic approaches have identified many genes controlling animal germ cell development, but only recently have some of these genes been linked to the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway, a gene silencing mechanism centered on small regulatory RNAs. Germ cells contain microRNAs (miRNAs), endogenous siRNAs (endo-siRNAs), and Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs); these are bound by members of the Piwi/Argonaute protein family. piwi genes were known to specify germ cell development, but we now understand that mutations disrupting germline development can also affect small RNA accumulation. Small RNA studies in germ cells have revealed a surprising diversity of regulatory mechanisms and a unifying function for germline genes in controlling the spread of transposable elements. Future challenges will be to understand the production of germline small RNAs and to identify the full breadth of gene regulation by these RNAs. Progress in this area will likely impact biomedical goals of manipulating stem cells and preventing diseases caused by the transposition of mobile DNA elements."

        "title": "Implication of microRNAs in drug resistance for designing novel cancer therapy.",
        "abstract": "Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have received increasing attention in the field of cancer research. miRNAs play important roles in many normal biological processes; however, the aberrant miRNA expression and its correlation with the development and progression of cancers is an emerging field. Therefore, miRNAs could be used as biomarkers for diagnosis of cancer and prediction of prognosis. Importantly, some miRNAs could regulate the formation of cancer stem cells and the acquisition of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, which are critically associated with drug resistance. Moreover, some miRNAs could target genes related to drug sensitivity, resulting in the altered sensitivity of cancer cells to anti-cancer drugs. Emerging evidences have also shown that knock-down or re-expression of specific miRNAs by synthetic anti-sense oligonucleotides or pre-miRNAs could induce drug sensitivity, leading to increased inhibition of cancer cell growth, invasion, and metastasis. More importantly, recent studies have shown that natural agents including isoflavone, 3,3'-diindolylmethane, and (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate altered miRNA expression profiles, leading to an increased sensitivity of cancer cells to conventional therapeutics. These emerging results suggest that specific targeting of miRNAs by different approaches could open new avenues for cancer treatment through overcoming drug resistance and thereby improve the outcome of cancer therapy."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNA molecules playing regulatory roles in animals and plants by repressing translation or cleaving RNA transcripts. The specific modulation of several microRNAs has been recently associated to some forms of human cancer, suggesting that these short molecules may represent a new class of genes involved in oncogenesis. In our study, we examined by microarray the global expression levels of 245 microRNAs in glioblastoma multiforme, the most frequent and malignant of primary brain tumors. The analysis of both glioblastoma tissues and glioblastoma cell lines allowed us to identify a group of microRNAs whose expression is significantly altered in this tumor. The most interesting results came from miR-221, strongly up-regulated in glioblastoma and from a set of brain-enriched miRNAs, miR-128, miR-181a, miR-181b, and miR-181c, which are down-regulated in glioblastoma."

        "abstract": "Arabidopsis encodes four DICER-like (DCL) proteins. DCL1 produces miRNAs, DCL2 produces some virus-derived siRNAs, and DCL3 produces endogenous RDR2-dependent siRNAs, but the role of DCL4 is unknown. We show that DCL4 is the primary processor of endogenous RDR6-dependent trans-acting siRNAs (tasiRNAs). Molecular and phenotypic analyses of all dcl double mutants also revealed partially compensatory functions among DCL proteins. In the absence of DCL4, some RDR6-dependent siRNAs were produced by DCL2 and DCL3, and in the absence of DCL3, some RDR2-dependent siRNAs were produced by DCL2 and DCL4. Consistent with partial redundancies, dcl2 and dcl3 mutants developed normally, whereas dcl4 and dcl3 dcl4 mutants had weak and severe rdr6 phenotypes, respectively, and increased tasiRNA target mRNA accumulation. After three generations, dcl3 dcl4 and dcl2 dcl3 mutants exhibited stochastic developmental phenotypes, some of which were lethal, likely owing to the accumulated loss of heterochromatic siRNA-directed marks. dcl1 dcl3 and dcl1 dcl4, but not dcl1 dcl2 mutants, had phenotypes more severe than dcl1 mutants, consistent with DCL1, DCL3, and DCL4 acting as the primary processors of the three respective classes of endogenous silencing RNAs and DCL2 acting to produce viral-derived siRNAs and as an alternative DCL for endogenous siRNA production."

        "abstract": "One of the functions of RNA silencing in plants is antiviral defense. A hallmark of RNA silencing is spreading of the silenced state through the plant. Little is known about the nature of the systemic silencing signal and the proteins required for its production, transport, and reception in plant tissues. Here, we show that the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase RDR6 in Nicotiana benthamiana is involved in defense against potato virus X at the level of systemic spreading and in exclusion of the virus from the apical growing point. It has no effect on primary replication and cell-to-cell movement of the virus and does not contribute significantly to the formation of virus-derived small interfering (si) RNA in a fully established potato virus X infection. In grafting experiments, the RDR6 homolog was required for the ability of a cell to respond to, but not to produce or translocate, the systemic silencing signal. Taking these findings together, we suggest a model of virus defense in which RDR6 uses incoming silencing signal to generate double-stranded RNA precursors of secondary siRNA. According to this idea, the secondary siRNAs mediate RNA silencing as an immediate response that slows down the systemic spreading of the virus into the growing point and newly emerging leaves."

        "title": "Expression of Arabidopsis MIRNA genes.",
        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are approximately 21-nucleotide noncoding RNAs that regulate target transcripts in plants and animals. In addition to miRNAs, plants contain several classes of endogenous small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) involved in target gene regulation and epigenetic silencing. Small RNA libraries were constructed from wild-type Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and mutant plants (rdr2 and dcl3) that were genetically enriched for miRNAs, and a computational procedure was developed to identify candidate miRNAs. Thirty-eight distinct miRNAs corresponding to 22 families were represented in the libraries. Using a 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends procedure, the transcription start sites for 63 miRNA primary transcripts from 52 MIRNA loci (99 loci tested) were mapped, revealing features consistent with an RNA polymerase II mechanism of transcription. Ten loci (19%) yielded transcripts from multiple start sites. A canonical TATA box motif was identified upstream of the major start site at 45 (86%) of the mapped MIRNA loci. The 5'-mapping data were combined with miRNA cloning and 3'-PCR data to definitively validate expression of at least 73 MIRNA genes. These data provide a molecular basis to explore regulatory mechanisms of miRNA expression in plants."

        "title": "The RNaseIII enzyme Dicer is required for morphogenesis but not patterning of the vertebrate limb.",
        "abstract": "The RNaseIII-containing enzyme Dicer is believed to be required for the processing of most, if not all, microRNAs (miRNAs) and for processing long dsRNA into small interfering RNAs. Because the complete loss of Dicer in both zebrafish and mice results in early embryonic lethality, it has been impossible to determine what role, if any, Dicer has in patterning later tissues in the developing vertebrate embryo. To bypass the early requirement of Dicer in development, we have created a conditional allele of this gene in mice. Using transgenes to drive Cre expression in discrete regions of the limb mesoderm, we find that removal of Dicer results in the loss of processed miRNAs. Phenotypically, developmental delays, in part due to massive cell death as well as disregulation of specific gene expression, lead to the formation of a much smaller limb. Thus, Dicer is required for the formation of normal mouse limbs. Strikingly, however, we did not detect defects in basic patterning or in tissue-specific differentiation of Dicer-deficient limb buds."

        "title": "BIC and miR-155 are highly expressed in Hodgkin, primary mediastinal and diffuse large B cell lymphomas.",
        "abstract": "In a previous study we demonstrated high expression of the non-coding BIC gene in the vast majority of Hodgkin's lymphomas (HLs). Evidence suggesting that BIC is a primary microRNA transcript containing the mature microRNA-155 (miR-155) as part of a RNA hairpin is now accumulating. We therefore analysed HL cell lines and tissue samples to determine whether miR-155 is also expressed in HL. High levels of miR-155 could be demonstrated, indicating that BIC is processed into a microRNA in HL. Most non-HL subtypes were negative for BIC as determined by RNA-ISH. However, in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and primary mediastinal B cell lymphoma (PMBL), significant percentages of positive tumour cells were observed in 12/18 and 8/8 cases. A higher proportion of tumour cells were positive for BIC in DLBCL with activated B cell-like phenotype than in DLBCL with germinal centre B cell-like phenotype. Differential BIC expression was confirmed by qRT-PCR analysis. Northern blot analysis showed expression of miR-155 in all DLBCL and PMBL derived cell lines and tissue samples analysed. In summary, we demonstrate expression of primary microRNA BIC and its derivative miR-155 in HL, PMBL and DLBCL."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression in both plants and animals. miRNA genes have been implicated in a variety of important biological processes, including development, differentiation, apoptosis, fat metabolism, viral infection, and cancer. Similar to protein-coding messenger RNAs, miRNA expression varies between tissues and developmental states. To acquire a better understanding of global miRNA expression in tissues and cells, we have developed isolation, labeling, and array procedures to measure the relative abundance of all of the known human mature miRNAs. The method relies on rapid isolation of RNA species smaller than ~40 nucleotides (nt), direct and homogenous enzymatic labeling of the mature miRNAs with amine modified ribonucleotides, and hybridization to antisense DNA oligonucleotide probes. A thorough performance study showed that this miRNA microarray system can detect subfemtomole amounts of individual miRNAs from <1 mug of total RNA, with 98% correlation between independent replicates. The system has been applied to compare the global miRNA expression profiles in 26 different normal human tissues. This comprehensive analysis identified miRNAs that are preferentially expressed in one or a few related tissues and revealed that human adult tissues have unique miRNA profiles. This implicates miRNAs as important components of tissue development and differentiation. Taken together, these results emphasize the immense potential of microarrays for sensitive and high-throughput analysis of miRNA expression in normal and disease states."

        "abstract": "In plants, the RNA silencing machinery responds to numerous inputs, including viral infection, microRNAs, and endogenous siRNAs that may act both in trans and in cis. Additionally, the full spectrum of silencing outcomes has been demonstrated in plants, ranging from mRNA degradation to repression at the level of protein synthesis to chromatin remodeling. Genetic studies in Arabidopsis have indicated that individual response pathways are functionally compartmentalized. However, to date, no biochemical systems have been available to investigate the roles of specific proteins within silencing pathways or the effects of selected mutations on the biochemical activity of those components. Here, we describe the generation of Arabidopsis extracts that reproduce many aspects of RNA silencing reactions in vitro. We find that specific members of the Dicer and Argonaute families have distinct biochemical activities, which provides insight into their roles within RNA silencing pathways in Arabidopsis."

        "abstract": "Argonaute (Ago) proteins constitute a key component of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). We report the crystal structure of Aquifex aeolicus Ago (Aa-Ago) together with binding and cleavage studies, which establish this eubacterial Ago as a bona fide guide DNA strand-mediated site-specific RNA endonuclease. We have generated a stereochemically robust model of the complex, where the guide DNA-mRNA duplex is positioned within a basic channel spanning the bilobal interface, such that the 5' phosphate of the guide strand can be anchored in a basic pocket, and the mRNA can be positioned for site-specific cleavage by RNase H-type divalent cation-coordinated catalytic Asp residues of the PIWI domain. Domain swap experiments involving chimeras of human Ago (hAgo1) and cleavage-competent hAgo2 reinforce the role of the PIWI domain in \"slicer\" activity. We propose a four-step Ago-mediated catalytic cleavage cycle model, which provides distinct perspectives into the mechanism of guide strand-mediated mRNA cleavage within the RISC."

However, genome-wide miRNA expression patterns in different organs during development of Arabidopsis thaliana have not yet been systemically investigated. In this study, we sequenced small RNA libraries generated from 27 different organ/tissue types, which cover the entire life cycle of Arabidopsis. Analysis of the sequencing data revealed that most miRNAs are ubiquitously expressed, whereas a small set of miRNAs display highly specific expression patterns. In addition, different miRNA members within the same family have distinct spatial and temporal expression patterns. Moreover, we found that some miRNAs are produced from different arms of their hairpin precursors at different developmental stages. This work provides new insights into the regulation of miRNA biogenesis and a rich resource for future investigation of miRNA functions in Arabidopsis."

        "abstract": "Development of multi-cellular organisms depends on the correct spatial and temporal expression of numerous genes acting in concert to form regulatory networks. The expression of individual genes can be controlled at different levels, e.g. at the transcriptional level by sequence-specific binding of transcription factors and/or by epigenetic modifications, or at the post-transcriptional level, e.g., by modulating translation or protein stability. Within the last decade the picture of gene regulatory mechanisms has been substantially enriched by the identification of small RNAs (sRNAs) of several distinct subspecies. Non-coding regulatory sRNAs contribute to transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene regulation by different modes of sequence-specific interaction with their targets. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), which guide post-transcriptional gene silencing, have been found to contribute to a variety of developmental programs in plants and animals. Here we provide an overview about generation and action of miRNAs and other small RNAs, and their contribution to an important developmental process in plants, flower formation."

In a remarkably short time since their discovery, siRNAs have entered human clinical trials in various disease areas. However, rapid acceptance of the use of siRNAs has been accompanied by recognition of several hurdles for the technology, including a lack of specificity. Off-target activity can complicate the interpretation of phenotypic effects in gene-silencing experiments and can potentially lead to unwanted toxicities. Here, we describe the types of off-target effects of siRNAs and methods to mitigate them, to help enable effective application of this exciting technology."

        "title": "Exploring chemical modifications for siRNA therapeutics: a structural and functional outlook.",
        "abstract": "RNA interference (RNAi) is a post-transcriptional gene silencing mechanism induced by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and micro-RNAs (miRNAs), and has proved to be one of the most important scientific discoveries made in the last century. The robustness of RNAi has opened up new avenues in the development of siRNAs as therapeutic agents against various diseases including cancer and HIV. However, there had remained a lack of a clear mechanistic understanding of messenger RNA (mRNA) cleavage mediated by Argonaute2 of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), due to inadequate structural data. The X-ray crystal structures of the Argonaute (Ago)-DNA-RNA complexes reported recently have proven to be a breakthrough in this field, and the structural details can provide guidelines for the design of the next generation of siRNA therapeutics. To harness siRNAs as therapeutic agents, the prudent use of various chemical modifications is warranted to enhance nuclease resistance, prevent immune activation, decrease off-target effects, and to improve pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. The focus of this review is to interpret the tolerance of various chemical modifications employed in siRNAs toward RNAi by taking into account the crystal structures and biochemical studies of Ago-RNA complexes. Moreover, the challenges and recent progress in imparting druglike properties to siRNAs along with their delivery strategies are discussed."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) control essential gene regulatory pathways in plants and animals. Serving as guides in silencing complexes, miRNAs direct Argonaute proteins to specific target messenger RNAs to repress protein expression. The mature, 22-nucleotide (nt) miRNA is the product of multiple processing steps, and recent studies have uncovered factors that directly control the stability of the functional RNA form. Although alteration of miRNA levels has been linked to numerous disease states, the mechanisms responsible for stabilized or reduced miRNA expression have been largely elusive. The discovery of specific cis-acting modifications and trans-acting proteins that affect miRNA half-life reveals new elements that contribute to the homeostasis of these vital regulatory molecules."

        "title": "A viral suppressor of gene silencing in plants.",
        "abstract": "Gene silencing is an important but little understood regulatory mechanism in plants. Here we report that a viral sequence, initially identified as a mediator of synergistic viral disease, acts to suppress the establishment of both transgene-induced and virus-induced posttranscriptional gene silencing. The viral suppressor of silencing comprises the 5'-proximal region of the tobacco etch potyviral genomic RNA encoding P1, helper component-proteinase (HC-Pro) and a small part of P3, and is termed the P1/HC-Pro sequence. A reversal of silencing assay was used to assess the effect of the P1/HC-Pro sequence on transgenic tobacco plants (line T4) that are posttranscriptionally silenced for the uidA reporter gene. Silencing was lifted in offspring of T4 crosses with four independent transgenic lines expressing P1/HC-Pro, but not in offspring of control crosses. Viral vectors were used to assess the effect of P1/HC-Pro expression on virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS). The ability of a potato virus X vector expressing green fluorescent protein to induce silencing of a green fluorescent protein transgene was eliminated or greatly reduced when P1/HC-Pro was expressed from the same vector or from coinfecting potato virus X vectors. Expression of the HC-Pro coding sequence alone was sufficient to suppress virus-induced gene silencing, and the HC-Pro protein product was required for the suppression. This discovery points to the role of gene silencing as a natural antiviral defense system in plants and offers different approaches to elucidate the molecular basis of gene silencing."

Following this initiation step, a sequence-specific signal of gene silencing spread from cells that had received the ectopic DNA via a relay mechanism that employs plasmodesmatal and phloem channels. The nature of this mechanism, the mode of its initiation, and the ability of the signal to move long distances indicate the existence of a sequence-specific signaling mechanism in plants that may have roles in developmental control as well as in protection against transposons and viruses."

Furthermore, possible involvement of miRs in neuronal function have been proposed. For example, miR-132 is closely related to neuronal outgrowth while miR-134 plays a role in postsynaptic regulation, suggesting that brain-specific miRs are critical for synaptic plasticity. On the other hand, numerous studies indicate that BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor), one of the neurotrophins, is essential for a variety of neuronal aspects such as cell differentiation, survival, and synaptic plasticity in the central nervous system (CNS). Interestingly, recent studies, including ours, suggest that BDNF exerts its beneficial effects on CNS neurons via up-regulation of miR-132. Here, we present a broad overview of the current knowledge concerning the association between neurotrophins and various miRs."

These small (18-25 nucleotide), evolutionarily conserved, non-coding RNA molecules regulate gene expression in a post-transcriptional manner. Several well-orchestered regulatory mechanisms involving miRNAs have been identified, with the potential to target multiple signaling pathways dysregulated in cancer. Since the initial discovery of miRNAs, there has been progress towards therapeutic applications, and several natural and synthetic chemopreventive agents also have been evaluated as modulators of miRNA expression in different cancer types. This review summarizes the most up-to-date information related to miRNA biogenesis, and critically evaluates proposed miRNA regulatory mechanisms in relation to cancer signaling pathways, as well as other epigenetic modifications (DNA methylation patterns, histone marks) and their involvement in drug resistance. We also discuss the mechanisms by which dietary factors regulate miRNA expression, in the context of chemoprevention versus therapy."

Since the biological roles of individual miRNAs will be dictated by the mRNAs that they regulate, the identification and validation of miRNA/mRNA target interactions is critical for our understanding of the regulatory networks governing biological processes. We promulgate the combined use of prediction algorithms, the examination of curated databases of experimentally supported miRNA/mRNA interactions, manual sequence inspection of cataloged miRNA binding sites in specific target mRNAs, and review of the published literature as a reliable practice for identifying and prioritizing biologically important miRNA/mRNA target pairs. Once a preferred miRNA/mRNA target pair has been selected, we propose that the authenticity of a functional miRNA/mRNA target pair be validated by fulfilling four well-defined experimental criteria. This review summarizes our current knowledge of miRNA biology, miRNA/mRNA target prediction algorithms, validated miRNA/mRNA target data bases, and outlines several experimental methods by which miRNA/mRNA targets can be authenticated. In addition, a case study of human endoglin is presented as an example of the utilization of these methodologies."

In these cases of either cosuppression or antisense suppression, there appears to be induction of a surveillance system within the plant that specifically degrades both the transgene and target RNAs. We show that transforming plants with virus or reporter gene constructs that produce RNAs capable of duplex formation confer virus immunity or gene silencing on the plants. This was accomplished by using transcripts from one sense gene and one antisense gene colocated in the plant genome, a single transcript that has self-complementarity, or sense and antisense transcripts from genes brought together by crossing. A model is presented that is consistent with our data and those of other workers, describing the processes of induction and execution of posttranscriptional gene silencing."

        "title": "SDE3 encodes an RNA helicase required for post-transcriptional gene silencing in Arabidopsis.",
        "abstract": "Post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) provides protection in plants against virus infection and can suppress expression of transgenes. Arabidopsis plants carrying mutations at the SDE3 locus are defective in PTGS mediated by a green fluorescent protein transgene. However, PTGS mediated by tobacco rattle virus (TRV) was not affected by sde3. From these results we conclude that SDE3, like the previously described RNA polymerase encoded by SDE1, acts at a stage in the mechanism that is circumvented when PTGS is mediated by TRV. The product of SDE3 is similar to RNA helicase-like proteins including GB110 in mouse and other proteins in Drosophila and humans. These proteins are similar to, but clearly distinct from Upf1p and SMG-2, which are required for nonsense-mediated mRNA decay in yeast and Caenorhabditis elegans and, in the case of SMG-2, for PTGS."

        "abstract": "Binding of microRNA (miRNA) to mRNA within the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) leads to either translational inhibition or to destruction of the target mRNA. Both of these functions are executed by Argonaute 2 (Ago2). Using hematopoiesis in mice as a model system to study the physiological function of Ago2 in vivo, we found that Ago2 controls early development of lymphoid and erythroid cells. We show that the unique and defining feature of Ago2, the Slicer endonuclease activity, is dispensable for hematopoiesis. Instead, we identified Ago2 as a key regulator of miRNA homeostasis. Deficiency in Ago2 impairs miRNA biogenesis from precursor-miRNAs followed by a reduction in miRNA expression levels. Collectively, our data identify Ago2 as a highly specialized member of the Argonaute family with an essential nonredundant Slicer-independent function within the mammalian miRNA pathway."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are potent post-transcriptional regulators of protein coding genes. Patterns of misexpression of miRNAs in cancer suggest key functions of miRNAs in tumorigenesis. However, current bioinformatics tools do not entirely support the identification and characterization of the mode of action of such miRNAs. Here, we used a novel functional genetic approach and identified miR-221 and miR-222 (miR-221&222) as potent regulators of p27(Kip1), a cell cycle inhibitor and tumor suppressor. Using miRNA inhibitors, we demonstrate that certain cancer cell lines require high activity of miR-221&222 to maintain low p27(Kip1) levels and continuous proliferation. Interestingly, high levels of miR-221&222 appear in glioblastomas and correlate with low levels of p27(Kip1) protein. Thus, deregulated expression of miR-221&222 promotes cancerous growth by inhibiting the expression of p27(Kip1)."

Over the past few years, hundreds of miRNAs have been identified from various organisms including vertebrates, nematodes, insects and plants. A high level of conservation of some miRNAs from animals to plants underlines their crucial role in eukaryotes. Although biogenesis and mode of action of miRNAs are now quite well understood, their numerous and specific regulatory functions remain to be unravelled. In this review, we summarise the current knowledge on miRNAs in insects, which was mainly acquired through the study of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster."

The mechanism by which RISC cleaves a target RNA is well understood, however it remains enigmatic how RISC finds its target RNA. Here, we show, both in vitro and in vivo, that the accessibility of the target site correlates directly with the efficiency of cleavage, demonstrating that RISC is unable to unfold structured RNA. In the course of target recognition, RISC transiently contacts single-stranded RNA nonspecifically and promotes siRNA-target RNA annealing. Furthermore, the 5' part of the siRNA within RISC creates a thermodynamic threshold that determines the stable association of RISC and the target RNA. We therefore provide mechanistic insights by revealing features of RISC and target RNAs that are crucial to achieve efficiency and specificity in RNA interference."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) constitute a class of small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression on the level of translation and/or mRNA stability. Mammalian miRNAs associate with members of the Argonaute (Ago) protein family and bind to partially complementary sequences in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of specific target mRNAs. Computer algorithms based on factors such as free binding energy or sequence conservation have been used to predict miRNA target mRNAs. Based on such predictions, up to one third of all mammalian mRNAs seem to be under miRNA regulation. However, due to the low degree of complementarity between the miRNA and its target, such computer programs are often imprecise and therefore not very reliable. Here we report the first biochemical identification approach of miRNA targets from human cells. Using highly specific monoclonal antibodies against members of the Ago protein family, we co-immunoprecipitate Ago-bound mRNAs and identify them by cloning. Interestingly, most of the identified targets are also predicted by different computer programs. Moreover, we randomly analyzed six different target candidates and were able to experimentally validate five as miRNA targets. Our data clearly indicate that miRNA targets can be experimentally identified from Ago complexes and therefore provide a new tool to directly analyze miRNA function."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNA) regulate key aspects of development and physiology in animals and plants. These regulatory RNAs act as guides of effector complexes to recognize specific mRNA sequences based on sequence complementarity, resulting in translational repression or site-specific cleavage. In plants, most miRNA targets are cleaved and show almost perfect complementarity with the miRNAs around the cleavage site. Here, we examined the non-protein coding gene IPS1 (INDUCED BY PHOSPHATE STARVATION 1) from Arabidopsis thaliana. IPS1 contains a motif with sequence complementarity to the phosphate (Pi) starvation-induced miRNA miR-399, but the pairing is interrupted by a mismatched loop at the expected miRNA cleavage site. We show that IPS1 RNA is not cleaved but instead sequesters miR-399. Thus, IPS1 overexpression results in increased accumulation of the miR-399 target PHO2 mRNA and, concomitantly, in reduced shoot Pi content. Engineering of IPS1 to be cleavable abolishes its inhibitory activity on miR-399. We coin the term 'target mimicry' to define this mechanism of inhibition of miRNA activity. Target mimicry can be generalized beyond the control of Pi homeostasis, as demonstrated using artificial target mimics."

        "abstract": "Small RNAs loaded into Argonaute proteins direct silencing of complementary target mRNAs. It has been proposed that multiple, imperfectly complementary small interfering RNAs or microRNAs, when bound to the 3' untranslated region of a target mRNA, function cooperatively to silence target expression. We report that, in cultured human HeLa cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts, Argonaute1 (Ago1), Ago3, and Ago4 act cooperatively to silence both perfectly and partially complementary target RNAs bearing multiple small RNA-binding sites. Our data suggest that for Ago1, Ago3, and Ago4, multiple, adjacent small RNA-binding sites facilitate cooperative interactions that stabilize Argonaute binding. In contrast, small RNAs bound to Ago2 and pairing perfectly to an mRNA target act independently to silence expression. Noncooperative silencing by Ago2 does not require the endoribonuclease activity of the protein: A mutant Ago2 that cannot cleave its mRNA target also silences noncooperatively. We propose that Ago2 binds its targets by a mechanism fundamentally distinct from that used by the three other mammalian Argonaute proteins."

        "title": "The RNA-induced silencing complex is a Mg2+-dependent endonuclease.",
        "abstract": "In the Drosophila and mammalian RNA interference (RNAi) pathways, target RNA destruction is catalyzed by the siRNA-guided, RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). RISC has been proposed to be an siRNA-directed endonuclease, catalyzing cleavage of a single phosphodiester bond on the RNA target. Although 5' cleavage products are readily detected for RNAi in vitro, only 3' cleavage products have been observed in vivo. Proof that RISC acts as an endonuclease requires detection of both 5' and 3' cleavage products in a single experimental system. Here, we show that siRNA-programmed RISC generates both 5' and 3' cleavage products in vitro; cleavage requires Mg(2+), but not Ca(2+), and the cleavage product termini suggest a role for Mg(2+) in catalysis. Moreover, a single phosphorothioate in place of the scissile phosphate blocks cleavage; the phosphorothioate effect can be rescued by the thiophilic cation Mn(2+), but not by Ca(2+) or Mg(2+). We propose that during catalysis, a Mg(2+) ion is bound to the RNA substrate through a nonbridging oxygen of the scissile phosphate. The mechanism of endonucleolytic cleavage is not consistent with the mechanisms of the previously identified RISC nuclease, Tudor-SN. Thus, the RISC-component that mediates endonucleolytic cleavage of the target RNA remains to be identified."

        "abstract": "The amplification at 13q31-q32 has been reported in not only hematopoietic malignancies but also in other solid tumors. We identified previously frequent amplification of chromosomal band 13q31-q32 in 70 cases of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients by conventional comparative genomic hybridization analysis. In an attempt to identify a candidate gene within this region, we used array comparative genomic hybridization and fluorescent in situ hybridization to map the 13q31-q32 amplicon. We then screened the 65 expressed sequence tags and Glypican 5 (GPC5) by reverse transcription-PCR and Northern blotting. As a result, we identified a novel gene, designated Chromosome 13 open reading frame 25 (C13orf25), which was overexpressed in B-cell lymphoma cell lines and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients with 13q31-q32 amplifications. However, GPC5, which has been reported to be a target gene for 13q31-q32 amplification, was truncated in one cell line, Rec1, possessing the amplification, and its expression in various cell lines with amplification at 13q31-q32 was not significantly different from that in other cell lines without amplification, suggesting that GPC5 is not likely to be the candidate gene. Additional analysis identified two major transcripts in the C13orf25 gene. The two transcripts A and B predicted open reading frames of 32 and 70-amino acid polypeptides, respectively. The former has been reported as bA121J7.2, which is conserved among species. Transcript-B also contained seven mature microRNAs in its untranslated region. These results suggest that the C13orf25 gene is the most likely candidate gene for the 13q31-q32 amplicon found in hematopoietic malignancies."

        "title": "Viral RNA silencing suppressors inhibit the microRNA pathway at an intermediate step.",
        "abstract": "RNA silencing suppressors from different plant viruses are structurally diverse. In addition to inhibiting the antiviral silencing response to condition susceptibility, many suppressors are pathogenicity factors that cause disease or developmental abnormalities. Here, unrelated suppressors from multiple viruses were shown to inhibit microRNA (miRNA) activities and trigger an overlapping series of severe developmental defects in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana. This suggests that interference with miRNA-directed processes may be a general feature contributing to pathogenicity of many viruses. A normally labile intermediate in the miRNA biogenesis/RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) assembly pathway, miRNA*, accumulated specifically in the presence of suppressors (P1/HC-Pro, p21, or p19) that inhibited miRNA-guided cleavage of target mRNAs. Both p21 and p19, but not P1/HC-Pro, interacted with miRNA/miRNA* complexes and hairpin RNA-derived short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in vivo. In addition, p21 bound to synthetic miRNA/miRNA* and siRNA duplexes in vitro. We propose that several different suppressors act by distinct mechanisms to inhibit the incorporation of small RNAs into active RISCs."

        "title": "The action of ARGONAUTE1 in the miRNA pathway and its regulation by the miRNA pathway are crucial for plant development.",
        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous 21-24-nt RNAs that can down-regulate gene expression by pairing to the messages of protein-coding genes to specify mRNA cleavage or repression of productive translation. They act within the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which in animals contains a member of the Argonaute family of proteins. In the present study, we show that Arabidopsis ago1 mutants have increased accumulation of mRNAs known to be targeted for cleavage by miRNAs. In hypomorphic ago1 alleles, this compromised miRNA function occurs without a substantial change in miRNA accumulation, whereas in null alleles it is accompanied by a drop in some of the miRNAs. Therefore, AGO1 acts within the Arabidopsis miRNA pathway, probably within the miRNA-programmed RISC, such that the absence of AGO1 destabilizes some of the miRNAs. We also show that targeting of AGO1 mRNA by miR168 is needed for proper plant development, illustrating the importance of feedback control by this miRNA. Transgenic plants expressing a mutant AGO1 mRNA with decreased complementarity to miR168 overaccumulate AGO1 mRNA and exhibit developmental defects partially overlapping with those of dcl1, hen1, and hyl1 mutants showing a decrease in miRNA accumulation. miRNA targets overaccumulate in miR168-resistant plants, suggesting that a large excess of AGO1 protein interferes with the function of RISC or sequesters miRNAs or other RISC components. Developmental defects induced by a miR168-resistant AGO1 mRNA can be rescued by a compensatory miRNA that is complementary to the mutant AGO1 mRNA, proving the regulatory relationship between miR168 and its target and opening the way for engineering artificial miRNAs in plants."

        "abstract": "A new paradigm of gene expression regulation has emerged recently with the discovery of microRNAs (miRNAs). Most, if not all, miRNAs are thought to control gene expression, mostly by base pairing with miRNA-recognition elements (MREs) found in their messenger RNA (mRNA) targets. Although a large number of human miRNAs have been reported, many of their mRNA targets remain unknown. Here we used a combined bioinformatics and experimental approach to identify important rules governing miRNA-MRE recognition that allow prediction of human miRNA targets. We describe a computational program, \"DIANA-microT\", that identifies mRNA targets for animal miRNAs and predicts mRNA targets, bearing single MREs, for human and mouse miRNAs."

The history of this cluster is governed by an initial phase of local (tandem) duplications, a series of duplications of entire clusters and subsequent loss of individual microRNAs from the resulting paralogous clusters. The complex history of the mir17 microRNA family appears to be closely linked to the early evolution of the vertebrate lineage."

In a present model of miRNA function in animals, miRNAs that form imperfect duplexes with their targets inhibit protein expression without affecting mRNA levels. Here, we report that in C. elegans, regulation by the let-7 miRNA results in degradation of its lin-41 target mRNA, despite the fact that its 3'UTR regulatory sequences can only partially base-pair with the miRNA. Furthermore, lin-14 and lin-28 are targets of the lin-4 miRNA, and we show that the mRNA levels for these protein-coding genes significantly decrease in response to lin-4 expression. This study reveals that mRNAs containing partial miRNA complementary sites can be targeted for degradation in vivo, raising the possibility that regulation at the level of mRNA stability may be more common than previously appreciated for the miRNA pathway."

To study the function of rice DCL proteins (OsDCLs) in the biogenesis of miRNAs and siRNAs, we searched genome databases and identified four OsDCLs. An RNA interference approach was applied to knock down two OsDCLs, OsDCL1 and OsDCL4, respectively. Strong loss of function of OsDCL1IR transformants that expressed inverted repeats of OsDCL1 resulted in developmental arrest at the seedling stage, and weak loss of function of OsDCL1IR transformants caused pleiotropic developmental defects. Moreover, all miRNAs tested were greatly reduced in OsDCL1IR but not OsDCL4IR transformants, indicating that OsDCL1 plays a critical role in miRNA processing in rice. In contrast, the production of siRNA from transgenic inverted repeats and endogenous CentO regions were not affected in either OsDCL1IR or OsDCL4IR transformants, suggesting that the production of miRNAs and siRNAs is via distinct OsDCLs."

        "abstract": "Arabidopsis thaliana contains four DICER-LIKE (DCL) genes with specialized functions in small RNA biogenesis for RNA interference-related processes. A mutant with defects in DCL4 was identified and analyzed for microRNA- and endogenous, small interfering RNA (siRNA)-related functions. The dcl4-2 mutant contained normal or near-normal levels of microRNAs (21 nt) and heterochromatin-associated siRNAs (24 nt). In contrast, this mutant lacked each of three families of 21-nt trans-acting siRNAs (ta-siRNAs) and possessed elevated levels of ta-siRNA target transcripts. The dcl4-2 mutant resembled an rna-dependent RNA polymerase 6 mutant in that both mutants lacked ta-siRNAs and displayed heterochronic defects in which vegetative phase change was accelerated. Double mutant analyses with dcl2-1, dcl3-1, and dcl4-2 alleles revealed hierarchical redundancy among DCL activities, leading to alternative processing of ta-siRNA precursors in the absence of DCL4. These data support the concept that plants have specialized and compartmentalized DCL functions for biogenesis of distinct small RNA classes."

        "title": "A pathway for the biogenesis of trans-acting siRNAs in Arabidopsis.",
        "abstract": "The Arabidopsis genes, TAS2 and TAS1a, produce structurally similar noncoding transcripts that are transformed into short (21-nucleotide [nt]) and long (24-nt) siRNAs by RNA silencing pathways. Some of these short siRNAs direct the cleavage of protein-coding transcripts, and thus function as trans-acting siRNAs (ta-siRNAs). Using genetic analysis, we defined the pathway by which ta-siRNAs and other short siRNAs are generated from these loci. This process is initiated by the miR173-directed cleavage of a primary poly(A) transcript. The 3' fragment is then transformed into short siRNAs by the sequential activity of SGS3, RDR6, and DCL4: SGS3 stabilizes the fragment, RDR6 produces a complementary strand, and DCL4 cleaves the resulting double-stranded molecule into short siRNAs, starting at the end with the miR173 cleavage site and proceeding in 21-nt increments from this point. The 5' cleavage fragment is also processed by this pathway, but less efficiently. The DCL3-dependent pathway that generates long siRNAs does not require miRNA-directed cleavage and plays a minor role in the silencing of these loci. Our results define the core components of a post-transcriptional gene silencing pathway in Arabidopsis and reveal some of the features that direct transcripts to this pathway."

Recently, microRNAs with sequence similarity to let-7 have been identified. We find that doubly mutant animals lacking the let-7 family microRNA genes mir-48 and mir-84 exhibit retarded molting behavior and retarded adult gene expression in the hypodermis. Triply mutant animals lacking mir-48, mir-84, and mir-241 exhibit repetition of L2-stage events in addition to retarded adult-stage events. mir-48, mir-84, and mir-241 function together to control the L2-to-L3 transition, likely by base pairing to complementary sites in the hbl-1 3' UTR and downregulating hbl-1 activity. Genetic analysis indicates that mir-48, mir-84, and mir-241 specify the timing of the L2-to-L3 transition in parallel to the heterochronic genes lin-28 and lin-46. These results indicate that let-7 family microRNAs function in combination to affect both early and late developmental timing decisions."

We sequenced more than two million small RNAs from seedlings and the inflorescence of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana.

Individual or clusters of highly regulated small RNAs were readily observed. Targets of antisense RNA or miRNA did not appear to be preferentially associated with siRNAs. Many genomic regions previously considered featureless were found to be sites of numerous small RNAs."

We show that the sequestration of miR-122 in liver cells results in marked loss of autonomously replicating hepatitis C viral RNAs. A genetic interaction between miR-122 and the 5' noncoding region of the viral genome was revealed by mutational analyses of the predicted microRNA binding site and ectopic expression of miR-122 molecules containing compensatory mutations. Studies with replication-defective RNAs suggested that miR-122 did not detectably affect mRNA translation or RNA stability. Therefore, miR-122 is likely to facilitate replication of the viral RNA, suggesting that miR-122 may present a target for antiviral intervention."

It is required for biogenesis of miRNAs and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), and also has a role in the effector steps of RNA silencing. Apart from Argonautes, no proteins are known to associate with Dicer in mammalian cells. In this work, we describe the identification of TRBP (human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) transactivating response (TAR) RNA-binding protein) as a protein partner of human Dicer. We show that TRBP is required for optimal RNA silencing mediated by siRNAs and endogenous miRNAs, and that it facilitates cleavage of pre-miRNA in vitro. TRBP had previously been assigned several functions, including inhibition of the interferon-induced double-stranded RNA-regulated protein kinase PKR and modulation of HIV-1 gene expression by association with TAR. The TRBP-Dicer interaction shown raises interesting questions about the potential interplay between RNAi and interferon-PKR pathways."

        "abstract": "Small RNAs of 20-30 nucleotides guide regulatory processes at the DNA or RNA level in a wide range of eukaryotic organisms. Many, although not all, small RNAs are processed from double-stranded RNAs or single-stranded RNAs with local hairpin structures by RNase III enzymes and are loaded into argonaute-protein-containing effector complexes. Many eukaryotic organisms have evolved multiple members of RNase III and the argonaute family of proteins to accommodate different classes of small RNAs with specialized molecular functions. Some small RNAs cause transcriptional gene silencing by guiding heterochromatin formation at homologous loci, whereas others lead to posttranscriptional gene silencing through mRNA degradation or translational inhibition. Small RNAs are not only made from and target foreign nucleic acids such as viruses and transgenes, but are also derived from endogenous loci and regulate a multitude of developmental and physiological processes. Here I review the biogenesis and function of three major classes of endogenous small RNAs in plants: microRNAs, trans-acting siRNAs, and heterochromatic siRNAs, with an emphasis on the roles of these small RNAs in developmental regulation."

        "abstract": "The discovery of small RNA molecules with the capacity to regulate messenger RNA (mRNA) stability and translation (and consequently protein synthesis) has revealed an additional level of post-transcriptional gene control. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), an evolutionarily conserved class of small noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally by base pairing to complementary sequences in the 3' untranslated regions of target mRNAs, are part of this modulatory RNA network playing a pivotal role in cell fate. Functional studies indicate that miRNAs are involved in the regulation of almost every biological pathway, while changes in miRNA expression are associated with several human pathologies, including cancer. By targeting oncogenes and tumor suppressors, miRNAs have the ability to modulate key cellular processes that define the cell phenotype, making them highly promising therapeutic targets. Over the last few years, miRNA-based anti-cancer therapeutic approaches have been exploited, either alone or in combination with standard targeted therapies, aiming at enhancing tumor cell killing and, ideally, promoting tumor regression and disease remission. Here we provide an overview on the involvement of miRNAs in cancer pathology, emphasizing the mechanisms of miRNA regulation. Strategies for modulating miRNA expression are presented and illustrated with representative examples of their application in a therapeutic context."

        "title": "Alterations of MicroRNAs in Solid Cancers and Their Prognostic Value.",
        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are evolutionarily conserved, naturally abundant, small, regulatory non-coding RNAs that inhibit gene expression at the post-transcriptional level in a sequence-specific manner. Each miRNA represses the protein expression of several coding genes in a manner proportional to the sequence complementarity with the target transcripts. MicroRNAs play key regulatory roles in organismal development and homeostasis. They control fundamental biological processes, such as stem-cell regulation and cellular metabolism, proliferation, differentiation, stress resistance, and apoptosis. Differential miRNA expression is found in malignant tumors in comparison to normal tissue counterparts. This indicates that miRNA deregulation contributes to the initiation and progression of cancer. Currently, miRNA expression signatures are being rigorously investigated in various tumor types, with the aim of developing novel, efficient biomarkers that can improve clinical management of cancer patients. This review discusses deregulated miRNAs in solid tumors, and focuses on their emerging prognostic potential."

        "title": "Dicer1 functions as a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor.",
        "abstract": "While the global down-regulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) is a common feature of human tumors, its genetic basis is largely undefined. To explore this question, we analyzed the consequences of conditional Dicer1 mutation (Dicer1 \"floxed\" or Dicer1(fl)) on several mouse models of cancer. Here we show Dicer1 functions as a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor gene. Deletion of a single copy of Dicer1 in tumors from Dicer1(fl/+) animals led to reduced survival compared with controls. These tumors exhibited impaired miRNA processing but failed to lose the wild-type Dicer1 allele. Moreover, tumors from Dicer1(fl/fl) animals always maintained one functional Dicer1 allele. Consistent with selection against full loss of Dicer1 expression, enforced Dicer1 deletion caused inhibition of tumorigenesis. Analysis of human cancer genome copy number data reveals frequent deletion of DICER1. Importantly, however, the gene has not been reported to undergo homozygous deletion, suggesting that DICER1 is haploinsufficient in human cancer. These findings suggest Dicer1 may be an important haploinsufficient tumor suppressor gene and, furthermore, that other factors controlling miRNA biogenesis may also function in this manner."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small silencing RNAs with regulatory roles in gene expression. miRNAs interact with Argonaute (AGO) proteins to form effector complexes that cleave target mRNAs or repress translation. Rice (Oryza sativa) encodes four AGO1 homologs (AGO1a, AGO1b, AGO1c, and AGO1d). We used RNA interference (RNAi) to knock down the four AGO1s. The RNAi lines displayed pleiotropic developmental phenotypes and had increased accumulation of miRNA targets. AGO1a, AGO1b, and AGO1c complexes were purified and further characterized. The three AGO1s all have a strong preference for binding small RNAs (sRNAs) with 5' U and have Slicer activity. We cataloged the sRNAs in each AGO1 complex by deep sequencing and found that all three AGO1s predominantly bound known miRNAs. Most of the miRNAs were evenly distributed in the three AGO1 complexes, suggesting a redundant role for the AGO1s. Intriguingly, a subset of miRNAs were specifically incorporated into or excluded from one of the AGO1s, suggesting functional specialization among the AGO1s. Furthermore, we identified rice miRNA targets at a global level. The validated targets include transcription factors that control major stages of development and also genes involved in a variety of physiological processes, indicating a broad regulatory role for miRNAs in rice."

        "abstract": "Animal cells have recently been shown to express a range of approximately 22 nucleotide noncoding RNAs termed micro RNAs (miRNAs). Here, we show that the human mir-30 miRNA can be excised from irrelevant, endogenously transcribed mRNAs encompassing the predicted 71 nucleotide mir-30 precursor. Expression of the mir-30 miRNA specifically blocked the translation in human cells of an mRNA containing artificial mir-30 target sites. Similarly, designed miRNAs were also excised from transcripts encompassing artificial miRNA precursors and could inhibit the expression of mRNAs containing a complementary target site. These data indicate that novel miRNAs can be readily produced in vivo and can be designed to specifically inactivate the expression of selected target genes in human cells."

        "abstract": "In Drosophila, miRNA strands are predominantly sorted into AGO1 to regulate seed-matched target transcripts, while their partner miRNA* strands are thought to be mostly degraded. Here, we report that Drosophila Argonautes exhibit different strand preferences for miRNA duplexes, and that in particular, many miRNA* species accumulate in the RNAi effector AGO2. AGO2-loaded miRNA* species require canonical RNAi factors for their accumulation, are efficiently 3' modified, and are preferentially active on extensively matched target transcripts. Differential miRNA/miRNA* sorting profiles are correlated with specific central mismatches. In vitro assays revealed an active role for Watson-Crick base-pairing at positions 9 and 10 in promoting strand selection by AGO2, with little reciprocal effect on strand selection by AGO1. We conclude that miRNA strand selection and sorting are actually linked processes that stem from distinct loading preferences of AGO proteins and that independent sorting of duplex strands is a general feature of Drosophila microRNA genes."

        "title": "Hierarchical rules for Argonaute loading in Drosophila.",
        "abstract": "Drosophila Argonaute-1 and Argonaute-2 differ in function and small RNA content. AGO2 binds to siRNAs, whereas AGO1 is almost exclusively occupied by microRNAs. MicroRNA duplexes are intrinsically asymmetric, with one strand, the miR strand, preferentially entering AGO1 to recognize and regulate the expression of target mRNAs. The other strand, miR*, has been viewed as a byproduct of microRNA biogenesis. Here, we show that miR*s are often loaded as functional species into AGO2. This indicates that each microRNA precursor can potentially produce two mature small RNA strands that are differentially sorted within the RNAi pathway. miR* biogenesis depends upon the canonical microRNA pathway, but loading into AGO2 is mediated by factors traditionally dedicated to siRNAs. By inferring and validating hierarchical rules that predict differential AGO loading, we find that intrinsic determinants, including structural and thermodynamic properties of the processed duplex, regulate the fate of each RNA strand within the RNAi pathway."

        "abstract": "In flies, small silencing RNAs are sorted between Argonaute1 (Ago1), the central protein component of the microRNA (miRNA) pathway, and Argonaute2 (Ago2), which mediates RNA interference. Extensive double-stranded character-as is found in small interfering RNAs (siRNAs)-directs duplexes into Ago2, whereas central mismatches, like those found in miRNA/miRNA* duplexes, direct duplexes into Ago1. Central to this sorting decision is the affinity of the small RNA duplex for the Dcr-2/R2D2 heterodimer, which loads small RNAs into Ago2. Here, we show that while most Drosophila miRNAs are bound to Ago1, miRNA* strands accumulate bound to Ago2. Like siRNA loading, efficient loading of miRNA* strands in Ago2 favors duplexes with a paired central region and requires both Dcr-2 and R2D2. Those miRNA and miRNA* sequences bound to Ago2, like siRNAs diced in vivo from long double-stranded RNA, typically begin with cytidine, whereas Ago1-bound miRNA and miRNA* disproportionately begin with uridine. Consequently, some pre-miRNA generate two or more isoforms from the same side of the stem that differentially partition between Ago1 and Ago2. Our findings provide the first genome-wide test for the idea that Drosophila small RNAs are sorted between Ago1 and Ago2 according to their duplex structure and the identity of their first nucleotide."

The locus encodes several transcripts without protein products, but microRNAs (miRNAs) have recently been identified from a common oncoviral integration locus. miRNA is an endogenous, non-coding small RNA by which gene expression is suppressed. Although miRNA genes, such as let-7 in the nematode, have orthologs among animals, the relationship between miRNAs and tumorigenesis or tumor suppression has been mainly discovered in several human cancers. On the contrary, this review clearly demonstrates the potential for human tumorigenesis of both miRNA genes from oncoviral integration sites and other cellular onco-microRNA genes, and we conclude that alteration of the miRNA profile of cells can be defined as tumorigenic or tumor suppressive. Thus, we explain here that virally-pathogenic miRNAs could also be partly responsible for oncogenesis or oncogene suppression to confirm' the RNA wave', with the miRNAs hypothesized as a mobile and functional genetic element."

We find that miRNAs are also present in plants, indicating that this class of noncoding RNA arose early in eukaryotic evolution. In this paper 16 Arabidopsis miRNAs are described, many of which have differential expression patterns in development. Eight are absolutely conserved in the rice genome. The plant miRNA loci potentially encode stem-loop precursors similar to those processed by Dicer (a ribonuclease III) in animals. Mutation of an Arabidopsis Dicer homolog, CARPEL FACTORY, prevents the accumulation of miRNAs, showing that similar mechanisms direct miRNA processing in plants and animals. The previously described roles of CARPEL FACTORY in the development of Arabidopsis embryos, leaves, and floral meristems suggest that the miRNAs could play regulatory roles in the development of plants as well as animals."

        "abstract": "There is increasing evidence indicating that the production of small regulatory RNAs is not the only process in which ribonuclease Dicer can participate. For example, it has been demonstrated that this enzyme is also involved in chromatin structure remodelling, inflammation and apoptotic DNA degradation. Moreover, it has become increasingly clear that cellular transcript and protein levels of Dicer must be strictly controlled because even small changes in their accumulation can initiate various pathological processes, including carcinogenesis. Accordingly, in recent years, a number of studies have been performed to identify the factors regulating Dicer gene expression and protein activity. As a result, a large amount of complex and often contradictory data has been generated. None of these data have been subjected to an exhaustive review or critical discussion. This review attempts to fill this gap by summarizing the current knowledge of factors that regulate Dicer gene transcription, primary transcript processing, mRNA translation and enzyme activity. Because of the high complexity of this topic, this review mainly concentrates on human Dicer. This review also focuses on an additional regulatory layer of Dicer activity involving the interactions of protein and RNA factors with Dicer substrates."

        "abstract": "The phenomenon of RNA interference (RNAi) which involves sequence-specific gene regulation by small non-coding RNAs, i.e., small interfering RNA (siRNA) and microRNA (miRNA) has emerged as one of most powerful approaches for crop improvement. RNAi based on siRNA is one of the widely used tools of reverse genetics which aid in revealing gene functions in many species. This technology has been extensively applied to alter the gene expression in plants with an aim to achieve desirable traits. RNAi has been used for enhancing the crop yield and productivity by manipulating the gene involved in biomass, grain yield and enhanced shelf life of fruits and vegetables. It has also been applied for developing resistance against various biotic (bacteria, fungi, viruses, nematodes, insects) and abiotic stresses (drought, salinity, cold, etc.). Nutritional improvements of crops have also been achieved by enriching the crops with essential amino acids, fatty acids, antioxidants and other nutrients beneficial for human health or by reducing allergens or anti-nutrients. microRNAs are key regulators of important plant processes like growth, development, and response to various stresses. In spite of similarity in size (20-24 nt), miRNA differ from siRNA in precursor structures, pathway of biogenesis, and modes of action. This review also highlights the miRNA based genetic modification technology where various miRNAs/artificial miRNAs and their targets can be utilized for improving several desirable plant traits. microRNA based strategies are much efficient than siRNA-based RNAi strategies due to its specificity and less undesirable off target effects. As per the FDA guidelines, small RNA (sRNA) based transgenics are much safer for consumption than those over-expressing proteins. This review thereby summarizes the emerging advances and achievement in the field of sRNAs and its application for crop improvement."

        "title": "MicroRNAs in central nervous system development.",
        "abstract": "During early and late embryo neurodevelopment, a large number of molecules work together in a spatial and temporal manner to ensure the adequate formation of an organism. Diverse signals participate in embryo patterning and organization synchronized by time and space. Among the molecules that are expressed in a temporal and spatial manner, and that are considered essential in several developmental processes, are the microRNAs (miRNAs). In this review, we highlight some important aspects of the biogenesis and function of miRNAs as well as their participation in ectoderm commitment and their role in central nervous system (CNS) development. Instead of giving an extensive list of miRNAs involved in these processes, we only mention those miRNAs that are the most studied during the development of the CNS as well as the most likely mRNA targets for each miRNA and its protein functions."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an extensive class of newly discovered endogenous small RNAs, which negatively regulate gene expression at the post-transcription levels. As the application of next-generation deep sequencing and advanced bioinformatics, the miRNA-related study has been expended to non-model plant species and the number of identified miRNAs has dramatically increased in the past years. miRNAs play a critical role in almost all biological and metabolic processes, and provide a unique strategy for plant improvement. Here, we first briefly review the discovery, history, and biogenesis of miRNAs, then focus more on the application of miRNAs on plant breeding and the future directions. Increased plant biomass through controlling plant development and phase change has been one achievement for miRNA-based biotechnology; plant tolerance to abiotic and biotic stress was also significantly enhanced by regulating the expression of an individual miRNA. Both endogenous and artificial miRNAs may serve as important tools for plant improvement."

        "title": "Functional small RNAs are generated from select miRNA hairpin loops in flies and mammals.",
        "abstract": "In the canonical animal microRNA (miRNA) pathway, Drosha generates \u223c60- to 70-nucleotide pre-miRNA hairpins that are cleaved by Dicer into small RNA duplexes that load into Argonaute proteins, which retain a single mature strand in the active complex. The terminal loops of some miRNA hairpins regulate processing efficiency, but once liberated by Dicer, they are generally considered nonfunctional by-products. Here, we show that specific miRNA loops accumulate in effector Argonaute complexes in Drosophila and mediate miRNA-type repression. This was unexpected, since endogenous loading of Argonaute proteins was believed to occur exclusively via small RNA duplexes. Using in vitro assays, which recapitulate Argonaute-specific loop loading from synthetic pre-miRNAs and even single-stranded oligoribonucleotides corresponding to miRNA loops, we reveal that the loop-loading mechanism is distinct from duplex loading. We also show that miRNA loops loaded into the miRNA effector AGO1 are subject to 3' resection, and structure-function analyses indicate selectivity of loop loading. Finally, we demonstrate that select miRNA loops in mammals are similarly loaded into Argonaute complexes and direct target repression. Altogether, we reveal a conserved mechanism that yields functional RNAs from miRNA loop regions, broadening the repertoire of Argonaute-dependent regulatory RNAs and providing evidence for functionality of endogenous ssRNA species."

        "abstract": "Despite the fact that different classes of small RNAs are generated by largely different biogenesis pathways, all mature small RNAs associate with an Argonaute family member to form the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). Gene silencing by RISC could not be studied in molecular detail because structural information on eukaryotic Argonautes was lacking. Recently, however, the structure of human Argonaute-2 (hAgo2), a model for RISC function, was determined in complexes with heterogeneous guide RNA and in complexes with a specific miRNA. We review the exciting advances that these two structures, together with the structure of a budding yeast Argonaute, brought to the field of eukaryotic RNA interference (RNAi), and how they will enable a more detailed mechanistic understanding of eukaryotic RISC."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as a new class of gene expression regulators whose functions influence a myriad of biological processes, from developmental decisions through immune responses and numerous pathologies, including cancer and autoimmunity. miRNAs are small RNA molecules that drive post-transcriptional negative regulation of gene expression by promoting the degradation or translational block of their target mRNAs. Here, we review some of the data relating to the role of miRNAs in the regulation of the B-cell lineage, with a special focus on results obtained in vivo. We start by giving a general overview of miRNA activity, including the issue of target specificity and the experimental approaches more widely used to analyze the function of these molecules. We then go on to discuss the function of miRNAs during B-cell differentiation in the bone marrow and in the periphery as well as during the humoral immune response. Finally, we describe a few examples of the contribution of miRNAs, both as oncogenes and tumor suppressors, to the development of B-cell neoplasias."

        "title": "RNA-based mechanisms regulating host-virus interactions.",
        "abstract": "RNA interference (RNAi) is an ancient process by which non-coding RNAs regulate gene expression in a sequence-specific manner. The core components of RNAi are small regulatory RNAs, approximately 21-30 nucleotides in length, including small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs). The past two decades have seen considerable progress in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the biogenesis of siRNAs and miRNAs. Recent advances have also revealed the crucial regulatory roles played by small RNAs in such diverse processes as development, homeostasis, innate immunity, and oncogenesis. Accumulating evidence indicates that RNAi initially evolved as a host defense mechanism against viruses and transposons. The ability of the host small RNA biogenesis machinery to recognize viral double-stranded RNA replication intermediates and transposon transcripts is critical to this process, as is small RNA-guided targeting of RNAs via complementary base pairing. Collectively, these properties confer unparalleled specificity and precision to RNAi-mediated gene silencing as an effective antiviral mechanism."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as important regulators of gene expression in diverse biological processes ranging from cell proliferation and survival to organ development and immunity. Here, we review mechanisms that regulate the expression of miRNAs themselves in the immune system. Like protein-coding genes, miRNAs can be regulated at the transcriptional level, downstream of signaling pathways and circuits that activate or inhibit transcription factors and chromatin remodeling. The resulting primary miRNAs are processed into active mature miRNAs through a series of biochemical steps, and miRNA abundance can be regulated at each step of this biogenesis pathway. Recent work has uncovered regulation of mature miRNA turnover in the immune system as well. A better understanding of these processes and their regulation by immunogenic stimuli is critical for integrating miRNAs into current models of gene expression networks that determine cell identity and immune function."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, noncoding RNAs that mediate posttranscriptional gene suppression in a sequence-specific manner. The ability of a single miRNA species to target multiple messenger RNAs (mRNAs) makes miRNAs exceptionally important regulators of various cellular functions. The regulatory capacity of miRNAs is increased further by the miRNA ability to suppress gene expression using multiple mechanisms that range from translational inhibition to mRNA degradation. The high miRNA diversity multiplied by the large number of individual miRNA targets generates a vast regulatory RNA network than enables flexible control of mRNA expression. The gene-regulatory capacity and diversity of miRNAs is particularly valuable in the brain, where functional specialization of neurons and persistent flow of information requires constant neuronal adaptation to environmental cues. In this review we will summarize the current knowledge about miRNA biogenesis and miRNA expression regulation with a focus on the role of miRNAs in the mammalian nervous system."

        "title": "RNA silencing and antiviral defense in plants.",
        "abstract": "Given the widespread impact of RNA silencing on the Arabidopsis thaliana genome, it is indeed remarkable that this means of gene regulation went undiscovered for so long. Since the publication of landmark papers in 1998 (Fire et al., Nature 391:806-811, 1998; Waterhouse et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 95:13959-13964, 1998), intense research efforts have resulted in much progress from the speculation of Mello and colleagues that \"the mechanisms underlying RNA interference probably exist for a biological purpose\" (Fire et al., Nature 391:806-811, 1998). Across the eukaryotic kingdom, with the notable exception of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Moazed, Science 326:544-550, 2009), the importance of small RNA-driven gene regulation has been recognized and implicated in central developmental processes as well as in aberrant and diseased states. Plants have by far the most complex RNA-based control of gene expression (Wang et al., Floriculture, ornamental and plant biotechnology, vol. III, 2006). Four distinct RNA silencing pathways have been recognized in plants, albeit with considerable conservation of the molecular components. These pathways are directed by various small RNA species, including microRNAs (miRNAs), trans-acting small interfering RNAs (siRNA) (ta-siRNAs), repeat-associated siRNAs (ra-siRNAs), and natural antisense transcript siRNAs (nat-siRNAs). The effective functionality of each of these pathways appear to be fundamental to the integrity of A. thaliana. Furthermore, in response to viral invasion, plants synthesize viral sRNAs as a means of defense. This process may in fact reflect the ancient origins of RNA silencing: plants may have evolved RNA silencing pathways as a defense mechanism against foreign nucleic acid species in the absence of an immune system (Wang and Metzlaff, Curr Opin Plant Biol 8:216-222, 2005). The generation of viral siRNAs is a particularly interesting illustration of RNA silencing as it provides a context to explore the potential to harness a naturally occurring system to the end goal of artificially engineering viral resistance."

Initial insight into the architecture of Argonautes came from studies of prokaryotic proteins, revealing a crescent-shaped base made up of the amino-terminal, PAZ, middle, and PIWI domains. The recently reported crystal structure of human Argonaute-2 (hAgo2), the \"slicer\" in RNA interference, in complex with a mixed population of RNAs derived from insect cells provides insight into the architecture of a eukaryotic Argonaute protein with defined biochemical and biological functions. Here, we report the structure of human Ago2 bound to a physiologically relevant microRNA, microRNA-20a, at 2.2 \u00c5 resolution. The miRNA is anchored at both ends by the Mid and PAZ domains and makes several kinks and turns along the binding groove. Interestingly, miRNA binding confers remarkable stability on hAgo2, locking this otherwise flexible enzyme into a stable conformation."

Their deregulation leads to extensive clinical consequences in tumorigenesis. Cancers demonstrate heterogeneity in their cell states implicated in their resistance and resurgence. Apart from proliferating cells, cancers harbor a small proportion of assorted quiescent cells that resist conventional therapeutics and contribute to cancer recurrence. MicroRNA expression, targets, microRNPs (microRNA-protein complexes) and their functions have been demonstrated to be regulated in distinct tumor cell states and as an adaptive response to stress signals in tumor-unfavorable environments. In turn, altered microRNPs and their modified post-transcriptional mechanisms of gene expression may contribute to tumor resistance and influence tumor progression. An understanding of distinct microRNA mechanisms in cancer cells would provide extensive insights into the versatile roles of microRNAs in the perpetuation of tumors and indicate potential therapeutic avenues."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding small RNAs that are master regulators of genic expression and consequently of many cellular processes. But their expression is often deregulated in human tumors leading to cancer development. Recently miRNAs were discovered in body fluids (serum, plasma and others) and their levels have often been reported to be altered in patients. Circulating miRNAs became one of the most promising biomarkers in oncology for early diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic response prediction. Here we describe the origins and roles of miRNAs, and summarize the most recent studies focusing on their usefulness as cancer biomarkers in lung, breast, colon, prostate, ovary cancers and melanoma. Lastly, we describe the main methodologies related to miRNA detection, which should be standardized for their use in clinical practice."

Increasing evidence supports a role for miRNAs in many human diseases, including cancer and autoimmune disorders. The function of miRNAs can be efficiently and specifically inhibited by chemically modified antisense oligonucleotides, supporting their potential as targets for the development of novel therapies for several diseases. In this Review we summarize our current knowledge of the design and performance of chemically modified miRNA-targeting antisense oligonucleotides, discuss various in vivo delivery strategies and analyse ongoing challenges to ensure the specificity and efficacy of therapeutic oligonucleotides in vivo. Finally, we review current progress on the clinical development of miRNA-targeting therapeutics."

        "abstract": "The discovery of microRNAs (miRNAs) almost two decades ago established a new paradigm of gene regulation. During the past ten years these tiny non-coding RNAs have been linked to virtually all known physiological and pathological processes, including cancer. In the same way as certain key protein-coding genes, miRNAs can be deregulated in cancer, in which they can function as a group to mark differentiation states or individually as bona fide oncogenes or tumour suppressors. Importantly, miRNA biology can be harnessed experimentally to investigate cancer phenotypes or used therapeutically as a target for drugs or as the drug itself."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate mRNA targets through perfect pairing with their seed region (positions 2-7). Recently, a precise genome-wide map of miRNA interaction sites in mouse brain was generated by high-throughput sequencing and analysis of clusters of ~50-nucleotide mRNA tags cross-linked to Argonaute (Ago HITS-CLIP). By analyzing Ago HITS-CLIP 'orphan clusters'-Ago binding regions from HITS-CLIP that cannot be explained by canonical seed matches-we have now identified an alternative binding mode used by miRNAs. Specifically, G-bulge sites (positions 5-6) are often bound and regulated by miR-124 in brain. More generally, bulged sites comprise \u226515% of all Ago-miRNA interactions in mouse brain and are evolutionarily conserved. We call position 6 the 'pivot' nucleotide and suggest a model in which a transitional 'nucleation bulge' leads to functional bulge mRNA-miRNA interactions, expanding the number of potential miRNA regulatory sites."

MicroRNA expression profiling was shown to be associated with tumour development, progression and response to therapy, suggesting their possible use as diagnostic, prognostic and predictive biomarkers. Moreover, based on the increasing number of studies demonstrating that microRNAs can function as potential oncogenes or oncosuppressor genes, with the goal to improve disease response and increase cure rates, miRNA-based anticancer therapies have recently been exploited, either alone or in combination with current targeted therapies. The advantage of using microRNA approaches is based on its ability to concurrently target multiple effectors of pathways involved in cell differentiation, proliferation and survival. Here, we review our current knowledge about the involvement of microRNAs in cancer, and their potential as diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic tools."

In addition, deregulated miRNA expression and subsequent gene expression changes are associated with hematologic diseases including myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia. This review focuses on myelopoiesis as a model to highlight the involvement of miRNA in the regulation of normal and malignant cellular signaling pathways. By incorporating miRNA regulation into well-established myeloid signal transduction pathways, we hope to shed light on targetable factors both upstream and downstream of miRNA signaling.

        "abstract": "The majority of plants are able to form the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis in association with AM fungi. During symbiosis development, plant cells undergo a complex reprogramming resulting in profound morphological and physiological changes. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important components of the regulatory network of plant cells. To unravel the impact of miRNAs and miRNA-mediated mRNA cleavage on root cell reprogramming during AM symbiosis, we carried out high-throughput (Illumina) sequencing of small RNAs and degradome tags of Medicago truncatula roots. This led to the annotation of 243 novel miRNAs. An increased accumulation of several novel and conserved miRNAs in mycorrhizal roots suggest a role of these miRNAs during AM symbiosis. The degradome analysis led to the identification of 185 root transcripts as mature miRNA and also miRNA*-mediated mRNA cleavage targets. Several of the identified miRNA targets are known to be involved in root symbioses. In summary, the increased accumulation of specific miRNAs and the miRNA-mediated cleavage of symbiosis-relevant genes indicate that miRNAs are an important part of the regulatory network leading to symbiosis development."

We show that PHB and PHV coding sequences are heavily methylated downstream of the microRNA complementary site in most wild-type plant cells and that methylation is reduced in phb-1d and phv-1d mutants. Decreased methylation is limited to the chromosome bearing the dominant mutant allele in phb-1d heterozygotes. Low levels of methylation are detected in wt PHB DNA isolated from undifferentiated tissues. These results suggest a model in which the microRNA interacts with nascent, newly processed PHB mRNA to alter chromatin of the corresponding PHB template DNA predominantly in differentiated cells."

        "title": "Human microRNAs are processed from capped, polyadenylated transcripts that can also function as mRNAs.",
        "abstract": "The factors regulating the expression of microRNAs (miRNAs), a ubiquitous family of approximately 22-nt noncoding regulatory RNAs, remain undefined. However, it is known that miRNAs are first transcribed as a largely unstructured precursor, termed a primary miRNA (pri-miRNA), which is sequentially processed in the nucleus, to give the approximately 65-nt pre-miRNA hairpin intermediate, and then in the cytoplasm, to give the mature miRNA. Here we have sought to identify the RNA polymerase responsible for miRNA transcription and to define the structure of a full-length human miRNA. We show that the pri-miRNA precursors for nine human miRNAs are both capped and polyadenylated and report the sequence of the full-length, approximately 3433-nt pri-miR-21 RNA. This pri-miR-21 gene sequence is flanked 5' by a promoter element able to transcribe heterologous mRNAs and 3' by a consensus polyadenylation sequence. Nuclear processing of pri-miRNAs was found to be efficient, thus largely preventing the nuclear export of full-length pri-miRNAs. Nevertheless, an intact miRNA stem-loop precursor located in the 3' UTR of a protein coding gene only moderately inhibited expression of the linked open reading frame, probably because the 3' truncated mRNA could still be exported and expressed. Together, these data show that human pri-miRNAs are not only structurally similar to mRNAs but can, in fact, function both as pri-miRNAs and mRNAs."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a growing family of small non-protein-coding regulatory genes that regulate the expression of homologous target-gene transcripts. They have been implicated in the control of cell death and proliferation in flies, haematopoietic lineage differentiation in mammals, neuronal patterning in nematodes and leaf and flower development in plants. miRNAs are processed by the RNA-mediated interference machinery. Drosha is an RNase III enzyme that was recently implicated in miRNA processing. Here we show that human Drosha is a component of two multi-protein complexes. The larger complex contains multiple classes of RNA-associated proteins including RNA helicases, proteins that bind double-stranded RNA, novel heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins and the Ewing's sarcoma family of proteins. The smaller complex is composed of Drosha and the double-stranded-RNA-binding protein, DGCR8, the product of a gene deleted in DiGeorge syndrome. In vivo knock-down and in vitro reconstitution studies revealed that both components of this smaller complex, termed Microprocessor, are necessary and sufficient in mediating the genesis of miRNAs from the primary miRNA transcript."

Here we show that Drosha exists in a multiprotein complex, the Microprocessor, and begin the process of deconstructing that complex into its constituent components. Along with Drosha, the Microprocessor also contains Pasha (partner of Drosha), a double-stranded RNA binding protein. Suppression of Pasha expression in Drosophila cells or Caenorhabditis elegans interferes with pri-miRNA processing, leading to an accumulation of pri-miRNAs and a reduction in mature miRNAs. Finally, depletion or mutation of pash-1 in C. elegans causes de-repression of a let-7 reporter and the appearance of phenotypic defects overlapping those observed upon examination of worms with lesions in Dicer (dcr-1) or Drosha (drsh-1). Considered together, these results indicate a role for Pasha in miRNA maturation and miRNA-mediated gene regulation."

        "title": "A pancreatic islet-specific microRNA regulates insulin secretion.",
        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) constitute a growing class of non-coding RNAs that are thought to regulate gene expression by translational repression. Several miRNAs in animals exhibit tissue-specific or developmental-stage-specific expression, indicating that they could play important roles in many biological processes. To study the role of miRNAs in pancreatic endocrine cells we cloned and identified a novel, evolutionarily conserved and islet-specific miRNA (miR-375). Here we show that overexpression of miR-375 suppressed glucose-induced insulin secretion, and conversely, inhibition of endogenous miR-375 function enhanced insulin secretion. The mechanism by which secretion is modified by miR-375 is independent of changes in glucose metabolism or intracellular Ca2+-signalling but correlated with a direct effect on insulin exocytosis. Myotrophin (Mtpn) was predicted to be and validated as a target of miR-375. Inhibition of Mtpn by small interfering (si)RNA mimicked the effects of miR-375 on glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and exocytosis. Thus, miR-375 is a regulator of insulin secretion and may thereby constitute a novel pharmacological target for the treatment of diabetes."

        "abstract": "To act as guides in the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) must be unwound into their component strands, then assembled with proteins to form the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which catalyzes target messenger RNA cleavage. Thermodynamic differences in the base-pairing stabilities of the 5' ends of the two approximately 21-nucleotide siRNA strands determine which siRNA strand is assembled into the RISC. We show that in Drosophila, the orientation of the Dicer-2/R2D2 protein heterodimer on the siRNA duplex determines which siRNA strand associates with the core RISC protein Argonaute 2. R2D2 binds the siRNA end with the greatest double-stranded character, thereby orienting the heterodimer on the siRNA duplex. Strong R2D2 binding requires a 5'-phosphate on the siRNA strand that is excluded from the RISC. Thus, R2D2 is both a protein sensor for siRNA thermodynamic asymmetry and a licensing factor for entry of authentic siRNAs into the RNAi pathway."

        "abstract": "Double-stranded RNA induces a post-transcriptional gene silencing process, termed RNAi, in diverse organisms. It is shown here that transcriptional gene silencing accompanied by de novo methylation of a target promoter in plants can be triggered by a double-stranded RNA containing promoter sequences. Similar to the double-stranded RNA involved in RNAi, this promoter double-stranded RNA, which is synthesized in the nucleus, is partially cleaved into small RNAs approximately 23 nucleotides in length. Both transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene silencing can thus be initiated by double-stranded RNAs that enter the same degradation pathway. The results also implicate double-stranded RNA in directing DNA methylation. Different constructs designed to produce double-stranded promoter RNA in various ways were evaluated for their ability to induce gene silencing in tobacco and Arabidopsis. RNA hairpins transcribed from inverted DNA repeats were the most effective trans-acting silencing signals. This strategy could be useful for transcriptionally downregulating genes in a variety of plants."

        "abstract": "Introduction of transgene DNA may lead to specific degradation of RNAs that are homologous to the transgene transcribed sequence through phenomena named post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) in plants, quelling in fungi, and RNA interference (RNAi) in animals. It was shown previously that PTGS, quelling, and RNAi require a set of related proteins (SGS2, QDE-1, and EGO-1, respectively). Here we report the isolation of Arabidopsis mutants impaired in PTGS which are affected at the Argonaute1 (AGO1) locus. AGO1 is similar to QDE-2 required for quelling and RDE-1 required for RNAi. Sequencing of ago1 mutants revealed one amino acid essential for PTGS that is also present in QDE-2 and RDE-1 in a highly conserved motif. Taken together, these results confirm the hypothesis that these processes derive from a common ancestral mechanism that controls expression of invading nucleic acid molecules at the post-transcriptional level. As opposed to rde-1 and qde-2 mutants, which are viable, ago1 mutants display several developmental abnormalities, including sterility. These results raise the possibility that PTGS, or at least some of its elements, could participate in the regulation of gene expression during development in plants."

        "abstract": "Accumulating evidence suggests a role for microRNAs in human carcinogenesis as novel types of tumor suppressors or oncogenes. However, their precise biological role remains largely elusive. In the present study, we aimed to identify microRNA species involved in the regulation of cell proliferation. Using quantitative RT-PCR analysis, we demonstrated that miR-34a was highly up-regulated in a human colon cancer cell line, HCT 116, treated with a DNA-damaging agent, adriamycin. Transient introduction of miR-34a into two human colon cancer cell lines, HCT 116 and RKO, caused complete suppression of cell proliferation and induced senescence-like phenotypes. Moreover, miR-34a also suppressed in vivo growth of HCT 116 and RKO cells in tumors in mice when complexed and administered with atelocollagen for drug delivery. Gene-expression microarray and immunoblot analyses revealed down-regulation of the E2F pathway by miR-34a introduction. Up-regulation of the p53 pathway was also observed. Furthermore, 9 of 25 human colon cancers (36%) showed decreased expression of miR-34a compared with counterpart normal tissues. Our results provide evidence that miR-34a functions as a potent suppressor of cell proliferation through modulation of the E2F signaling pathway. Abrogation of miR-34a function could contribute to aberrant cell proliferation, leading to colon cancer development."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are 21-24 nucleotide (nt) duplex RNAs that are created from precursor transcripts by subsequent processing steps mediated by members of the RNAseIII family, Drosha and Dicer. One of the two strands is incorporated into the active sites of the Argonaute family of proteins, where it serves as a guide for Watson-Crick base pairing with complementary sequences in target messenger RNAs (mRNAs). In mammals, the majority of miRNAs guide the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) to the 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNA targets, with the consequence that translation of the target mRNAs is inhibited. The importance of miRNAs in normal cellular development and metabolism is only now being realized. miRNA deficiencies or excesses have been correlated with a number of clinically important diseases ranging from myocardial infarction to cancers. The loss or gain of miRNA function can be caused by a single point mutation in either the miRNA or its target or by epigenetic silencing of primary miRNA transcription units. This review summarizes miRNA biogenesis and biology, explores the potential roles miRNAs can play in a variety of diseases, and suggests some therapeutic applications for restoring or inhibiting miRNA function."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, noncoding RNAs that regulate expression of many genes. Recent studies suggest roles of miRNAs in carcinogenesis. We and others have shown that expression profiles of miRNAs are different in lung cancer vs. normal lung, although the significance of this aberrant expression is poorly understood. Among the reported down-regulated miRNAs in lung cancer, the miRNA (miR)-29 family (29a, 29b, and 29c) has intriguing complementarities to the 3'-UTRs of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT)3A and -3B (de novo methyltransferases), two key enzymes involved in DNA methylation, that are frequently up-regulated in lung cancer and associated with poor prognosis. We investigated whether miR-29s could target DNMT3A and -B and whether restoration of miR-29s could normalize aberrant patterns of methylation in non-small-cell lung cancer. Here we show that expression of miR-29s is inversely correlated to DNMT3A and -3B in lung cancer tissues, and that miR-29s directly target both DNMT3A and -3B. The enforced expression of miR-29s in lung cancer cell lines restores normal patterns of DNA methylation, induces reexpression of methylation-silenced tumor suppressor genes, such as FHIT and WWOX, and inhibits tumorigenicity in vitro and in vivo. These findings support a role of miR-29s in epigenetic normalization of NSCLC, providing a rationale for the development of miRNA-based strategies for the treatment of lung cancer."

        "title": "Structural features of small RNA precursors determine Argonaute loading in Caenorhabditis elegans.",
        "abstract": "In C. elegans, DCR-1 is required for the maturation of both short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs), which are subsequently loaded into different Argonaute proteins to mediate silencing via distinct mechanisms. We used in vivo analyses to show that precursors of small RNAs contain structural features that direct the small RNAs into the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway or the miRNA-processing pathway. Nucleotide changes in the pre-let-7 miRNA precursor that make its stem fully complementary cause the resulting small RNA to be recognized as siRNA and induce binding to RDE-1, which leads to RNAi. Mismatches of 1 to 3 nucleotides at various positions in the stem of the precursor restore direction into the miRNA pathway, as the largest portion of such small RNA variants is associated with ALG-1. The Argonaute proteins to which the small RNAs are bound determine the silencing mode, and no functional overlap between RDE-1 and ALG-1 was detected."

        "abstract": "Argonaute (Ago) proteins mediate silencing of nucleic acid targets by small RNAs. In fission yeast, Ago1, Tas3 and Chp1 assemble into a RITS complex, which silences transcription near centromeres. Here we describe a repetitive motif within Tas3, termed the 'Argonaute hook', that is conserved from yeast to humans and binds Ago proteins through their PIWI domains in vitro and in vivo. Site-directed mutation of key residues in the motif disrupts Ago binding and heterochromatic silencing in vivo. Unexpectedly, a PIWI domain pocket that binds the 5' end of the short interfering RNA guide strand is required for direct binding of the Ago hook. Moreover, wild-type but not mutant Ago hook peptides derepress microRNA-mediated translational silencing of a target messenger RNA. Proteins containing the conserved Ago hook may thus be important regulatory components of effector complexes in RNA interference."

        "title": "Role of miRNA in carcinogenesis and biomarker selection: a methodological view.",
        "abstract": "miRNAs, their involvement in cancer development and their potential to be robust biomarkers of diagnosis, staging, prognosis and response to therapy are reviewed. In small RNA animal biogenesis, miRNA genes in the nucleus are transcribed to generate long primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs), which are first cropped by RNase-III-type enzyme Drosha to release hairpin intermediates (pre-miRNAs) in the nucleus. Pre-miRNA is then exported to the cytoplasm by exportin-5. Following arrival in the cytoplasm, pre-miRNAs are subjected to the second processing step (dicing) to release the mature miRNA duplex, which is then separated: one strand becomes the mature miRNA and the other is degraded. These tiny miRNAs induce messenger degradation, translational repression or both. However, there is no evidence to demonstrate that these two mechanisms exist in the regulation of the same gene. Since a miRNA can target numerous mRNAs, often in combination with other miRNAs, these miRNAs operate a highly complex regulatory network. The specific function in most mammalian miRNAs is unknown. However, data suggest that miRNA genes, approximately 1% of all human genes, regulate protein production for 20-30% or more of all genes. miRNA expression profiles are effective for classifying solid and hematologic human cancers, and have shown great promise for early cancer detection. This is of great importance for effective treatment before the cells metastasize; therefore, tumors can be surgically resected. Computer-based prediction approaches of miRNAs and their targets, and biological validation techniques for ascertaining these predictions, currently play a central role in the discovery of miRNAs and in elucidating their function. Guidelines have been established for the identification and annotation of new miRNAs to distinguish them from other RNAs, especially siRNAs. These guidelines take into account factors such as transcript structure, conservation and processing, and a centralized, searchable database of all possible miRNA sequence information and annotation for humans and of more than 38 other species. Two approaches are used to characterize miRNAs: studying expression of known miRNAs by hybridization-based techniques (e.g., northern blots, RNase protection, primer extension, real-time, quantitative PCR and microarrays) or discovery of novel miRNAs molecules by cloning and sequencing. Owing to their adaptability and high throughput, microarrays may prove to be the preferred platform for whole-genome miRNA expression analysis."

        "title": "Downregulation of microRNAs-143 and -145 in B-cell malignancies.",
        "abstract": "Recently, it has been found that inappropriate expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) is strongly associated with carcinogenesis. In this study, we demonstrated that the expression of miRNAs (miRs) -143 and -145, the levels of which were previously shown to be reduced in colon cancers and various kinds of established cancer cell lines, was also decreased in most of the B-cell malignancies examined, including chronic lymphocytic leukemias (CLL), B-cell lymphomas, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed B-cell lines, and Burkitt lymphoma cell lines. All samples from 13 CLL patients and eight of nine B-cell lymphoma ones tested exhibited an extremely low expression of miRs-143 and -145. The expression levels of miRs-143 and -145 were consistently low in human Burkitt lymphoma cell lines and were inversely associated with the cell proliferation observed in the EBV-transformed B-cell lines. Moreover, the introduction of either precursor or mature miR-143 and -145 into Raji cells resulted in a significant growth inhibition that occurred in a dose-dependent manner and the target gene of miRNA-143 was determined to be ERK5, as previously reported in human colon cancer DLD-1 cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that miRs-143 and -145 may be useful as biomarkers that differentiate B-cell malignant cells from normal cells and contribute to carcinogenesis in B-cell malignancies by a newly defined mechanism."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs are key regulators of gene expression, but the precise mechanisms underlying their interaction with their mRNA targets are still poorly understood. Here, we systematically investigate the role of target-site accessibility, as determined by base-pairing interactions within the mRNA, in microRNA target recognition. We experimentally show that mutations diminishing target accessibility substantially reduce microRNA-mediated translational repression, with effects comparable to those of mutations that disrupt sequence complementarity. We devise a parameter-free model for microRNA-target interaction that computes the difference between the free energy gained from the formation of the microRNA-target duplex and the energetic cost of unpairing the target to make it accessible to the microRNA. This model explains the variability in our experiments, predicts validated targets more accurately than existing algorithms, and shows that genomes accommodate site accessibility by preferentially positioning targets in highly accessible regions. Our study thus demonstrates that target accessibility is a critical factor in microRNA function."

        "title": "OncomiRs: the discovery and progress of microRNAs in cancers.",
        "abstract": "microRNAs (miRNAs) are evolutionarily conserved, endogenous, small, noncoding RNA molecules of about 22 nucleotides in length that function as posttranscriptional gene regulators. They are deemed to play a crucial role in the initiation and progression of human cancer, and those with a role in cancer are designated as oncogenic miRNAs (oncomiRs). For example, miR-15 and miR-16 induce apoptosis by targeting Bcl2. miRNAs from the miR-17-92 cluster modulate tumor formation and function as oncogenes by influencing the translation of E2F1 mRNA. miR-21 modulates gemcitabine-induced apoptosis by phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10-dependent activation of PI 3-kinase signaling. miR-34a acts as a suppressor of neuroblastoma tumorigenesis by targeting the mRNA encoding E2F3 and reducing E2F3 protein levels. The chromosomal translocations associating with human tumors disrupt the repression of High mobility group A2 by let-7 miRNA. In addition, the oncomiRs expression profiling of human malignancies has also identified a number of diagnostic and prognostic cancer signatures. This article introduces the roles of oncomiRs in neoplasm development, progression, diagnosis, prognostication, as well as their mechanism of actions on target mRNAs and the functional outcomes of their actions on mRNAs. The paper ends with a brief perspective to the future of oncomiRs."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs have been implicated in regulating diverse cellular pathways. Although there is emerging evidence that some microRNAs can function as oncogenes or tumour suppressors, the role of microRNAs in mediating cancer metastasis remains unexplored. Here we show, using a combination of mouse and human cells, that microRNA-10b (miR-10b) is highly expressed in metastatic breast cancer cells and positively regulates cell migration and invasion. Overexpression of miR-10b in otherwise non-metastatic breast tumours initiates robust invasion and metastasis. Expression of miR-10b is induced by the transcription factor Twist, which binds directly to the putative promoter of mir-10b (MIRN10B). The miR-10b induced by Twist proceeds to inhibit translation of the messenger RNA encoding homeobox D10, resulting in increased expression of a well-characterized pro-metastatic gene, RHOC. Significantly, the level of miR-10b expression in primary breast carcinomas correlates with clinical progression. These findings suggest the workings of an undescribed regulatory pathway, in which a pleiotropic transcription factor induces expression of a specific microRNA, which suppresses its direct target and in turn activates another pro-metastatic gene, leading to tumour cell invasion and metastasis."

        "abstract": "microRNAs (miRNAs) silence gene expression by suppressing protein production and/or by promoting mRNA decay. To elucidate how silencing is accomplished, we screened an RNA interference library for suppressors of miRNA-mediated regulation in Drosophila melanogaster cells. In addition to proteins known to be required for miRNA biogenesis and function (i.e., Drosha, Pasha, Dicer-1, AGO1, and GW182), the screen identified the decapping activator Ge-1 as being required for silencing by miRNAs. Depleting Ge-1 alone and/or in combination with other decapping activators (e.g., DCP1, EDC3, HPat, or Me31B) suppresses silencing of several miRNA targets, indicating that miRNAs elicit mRNA decapping. A comparison of gene expression profiles in cells depleted of AGO1 or of individual decapping activators shows that approximately 15% of AGO1-targets are also regulated by Ge-1, DCP1, and HPat, whereas 5% are dependent on EDC3 and LSm1-7. These percentages are underestimated because decapping activators are partially redundant. Furthermore, in the absence of active translation, some miRNA targets are stabilized, whereas others continue to be degraded in a miRNA-dependent manner. These findings suggest that miRNAs mediate post-transcriptional gene silencing by more than one mechanism."

        "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is known for its very poor overall prognosis. Accurate early diagnosis and new therapeutic modalities are therefore urgently needed. We used 377 feature microRNA (miRNA) arrays to investigate miRNA expression in normal pancreas, chronic pancreatitis, and PDAC tissues as well as PDAC-derived cell lines. A pancreatic miRNome was established comparing the data from normal pancreas with a reference set of 33 human tissues. The expression of miR-216 and -217 and lack of expression of miR-133a were identified as characteristic of pancreas tissue. Unsupervised clustering showed that the three pancreatic tissues types can be classified according to their respective miRNA expression profiles. We identified 26 miRNAs most prominently misregulated in PDAC and a relative quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction index using only miR-217 and -196a was found to discriminate normal pancreas, chronic pancreatitis and cancerous tissues, establishing a potential utility for miRNAs in diagnostic procedures. Lastly, comparing differentially expressed genes from PDAC with predicted miRNA target genes for the top 26 miRNAs, we identified potential novel links between aberrant miRNA expression and known target genes relevant to PDAC biology. Our data provides novel insights into the miRNA-driven pathophysiological mechanisms involved in PDAC development and offers new candidate targets to be exploited both for diagnostic and therapeutic strategies."

        "title": "MicroRNA-155 is induced during the macrophage inflammatory response.",
        "abstract": "The mammalian inflammatory response to infection involves the induction of several hundred genes, a process that must be carefully regulated to achieve pathogen clearance and prevent the consequences of unregulated expression, such as cancer. Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as a class of gene expression regulators that has also been linked to cancer. However, the relationship between inflammation, innate immunity, and miRNA expression is just beginning to be explored. In the present study, we use microarray technology to identify miRNAs induced in primary murine macrophages after exposure to polyriboinosinic:polyribocytidylic acid or the cytokine IFN-beta. miR-155 was the only miRNA of those tested that was substantially up-regulated by both stimuli. It also was induced by several Toll-like receptor ligands through myeloid differentiation factor 88- or TRIF-dependent pathways, whereas up-regulation by IFNs was shown to involve TNF-alpha autocrine signaling. Pharmacological inhibition of the kinase JNK blocked induction of miR-155 in response to either polyriboinosinic:polyribocytidylic acid or TNF-alpha, suggesting that miR-155-inducing signals use the JNK pathway. Together, these findings characterize miR-155 as a common target of a broad range of inflammatory mediators. Importantly, because miR-155 is known to function as an oncogene, these observations identify a potential link between inflammation and cancer."

        "title": "Processing of intronic microRNAs.",
        "abstract": "The majority of human microRNA (miRNA) loci are located within intronic regions and are transcribed by RNA polymerase II as part of their hosting transcription units. The primary transcripts are cleaved by Drosha to release approximately 70 nt pre-miRNAs that are subsequently processed by Dicer to generate mature approximately 22 nt miRNAs. It is generally believed that intronic miRNAs are released by Drosha from excised introns after the splicing reaction has occurred. However, our database searches and experiments indicate that intronic miRNAs can be processed from unspliced intronic regions before splicing catalysis. Intriguingly, cleavage of an intron by Drosha does not significantly affect the production of mature mRNA, suggesting that a continuous intron may not be required for splicing and that the exons may be tethered to each other. Hence, Drosha may cleave intronic miRNAs between the splicing commitment step and the excision step, thereby ensuring both miRNA biogenesis and protein synthesis from a single primary transcript. Our study provides a novel example of eukaryotic gene organization and RNA-processing control."

        "abstract": "The molecular controls that govern the differentiation of embryonic stem (ES) cells remain poorly understood. DGCR8 is an RNA-binding protein that assists the RNase III enzyme Drosha in the processing of microRNAs (miRNAs), a subclass of small RNAs. Here we study the role of miRNAs in ES cell differentiation by generating a Dgcr8 knockout model. Analysis of mouse knockout ES cells shows that DGCR8 is essential for biogenesis of miRNAs. On the induction of differentiation, DGCR8-deficient ES cells do not fully downregulate pluripotency markers and retain the ability to produce ES cell colonies; however, they do express some markers of differentiation. This phenotype differs from that reported for Dicer1 knockout cells, suggesting that Dicer has miRNA-independent roles in ES cell function. Our findings indicate that miRNAs function in the silencing of ES cell self-renewal that normally occurs with the induction of differentiation."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are members of non-coding RNAs. They are involved in diverse biological functions. MiRNAs are precisely regulated in a tissue- and developmental-specific manner, but dysregulated in many human diseases, in particular cancers. Transcriptional regulation, post-transcriptional regulation, as well as genetic alterations, are the three major mechanisms controlling the spatial and temporal expression of miRNAs. Emerging evidence now indicates that transcriptional and epigenetic regulations play major roles in miRNA expression. This review summarizes the current knowledge and discusses the future challenges."

MiR-155-5p is highly expressed in both activated B- and T-cells and in monocytes/macrophages. MiR-155-5p is one of the best characterized miRNAs and recent data indicate that miR-155-5p plays a critical role in various physiological and pathological processes such as hematopoietic lineage differentiation, immunity, inflammation, viral infections, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and Down syndrome. In this review we summarize the mechanisms by which MIR155HG expression can be regulated. Given that the pathologies mediated by miR-155-5p result from the over-expression of this miRNA it may be possible to therapeutically attenuate miR-155-5p levels in the treatment of several pathological processes."

        "abstract": "The concept of vaccination came to light following Edward Jenner's classical observation on milkmaids who were protected against smallpox. However, plants lack the cellular based immunity system and thus it was not appreciated earlier that plants can also be protected from their pathogens. But phenomena like cross-protection, pathogen derived resistance (PDR), viral recovery, etc. in plants suggested that plants have also evolved immunity against their pathogens. The further advances in the field revealed that an endogenous defense system could have multiple prongs. With the advent of RNAi, it was clear that the antiviral immune responses are related to the induction of specific small RNAs. The detection of virus specific small RNAs (vsiRNA) in immunized plants confirmed their roles in the immunity against pathogens. Although many issues related to antiviral mechanisms are yet to be addressed, the existing tools of RNAi can be efficiently used to control the invading viruses in transgenic plants. It is also possible that the microRNA(s) induced in infected plants impart immunity against viral pathogens. So the small RNA molecules play a vital role in defense system and these can be engineered to enhance the immunity against specific viral pathogens."

        "abstract": "The majority of human protein-coding genes are predicted to be targets of miRNA-mediated post-transcriptional regulation. The widespread influence of miRNAs is illustrated by their essential roles in all biological processes. Regulated miRNA expression is essential for maintaining cellular differentiation; therefore alterations in miRNA expression patterns are associated with several diseases, including various cancers. High-throughput sequencing technologies revealed low level expressing miRNA isoforms, termed isomiRs. IsomiRs may differ in sequence, length, target preference and expression patterns from their parental miRNA and can arise from differences in miRNA biosynthesis, RNA editing, or SNPs inherent to the miRNA gene. The association between isomiR expression and disease progression is largely unknown. Misregulated miRNA expression is thought to contribute to the formation and/or progression of cancer. However, due to the diversity of targeted transcripts, miRNAs can function as both tumor-suppressor genes and oncogenes as defined by cellular context. Despite this, miRNA profiling studies concluded that the differential expression of particular miRNAs in diseased tissue could aid the diagnosis and treatment of some cancers."

We show here that Argonaute 2, a key component of RISC, is not randomly distributed but concentrates in mRNA decay centres that are known as cytoplasmic bodies. The localization of Argonaute 2 in decay centres is not altered by the presence or absence of small interfering RNAs or their targeted mRNAs. However, RNA is required for the integrity of cytoplasmic bodies because RNase eliminates Argonaute 2 localization. In addition, Argonaute 1, another Argonaute family member, is concentrated in cytoplasmic bodies. These results provide new insight into the mechanism of RNAi function."

        "abstract": "Seventy-five previously known plant microRNAs (miRNAs) were classified into 14 families according to their gene sequence identity. A total of 18,694 plant expressed sequence tags (EST) were found in the GenBank EST databases by comparing all previously known Arabidopsis miRNAs to Genbank plant EST databases with BLAST algorithms. After removing the EST sequences with high numbers (more than 2) of mismatched nucleotides, a total of 812 EST contigs were identified. After predicting and scoring the RNA secondary structure of the 812 EST sequences using mFold software, 338 new potential miRNAs were identified in 60 plant species. miRNAs are widespread. Some microRNAs may highly conserve in the plant kingdom, and they may have the same ancestor in very early evolution. There is no nucleotide substitution in most miRNAs among many plant species. Some of the new identified potential miRNAs may be induced and regulated by environmental biotic and abiotic stresses. Some may be preferentially expressed in specific tissues, and are regulated by developmental switching. These findings suggest that EST analysis is a good alternative strategy for identifying new miRNA candidates, their targets, and other genes. A large number of miRNAs exist in different plant species and play important roles in plant developmental switching and plant responses to environmental abiotic and biotic stresses as well as signal transduction. Environmental stresses and developmental switching may be the signals for synthesis and regulation of miRNAs in plants. A model for miRNA induction and expression, and gene regulation by miRNA is hypothesized."

        "title": "Processing of pre-microRNAs by the Dicer-1-Loquacious complex in Drosophila cells.",
        "abstract": "microRNAs (miRNAs) are a large family of 21- to 22-nucleotide non-coding RNAs that interact with target mRNAs at specific sites to induce cleavage of the message or inhibit translation. miRNAs are excised in a stepwise process from primary miRNA (pri-miRNA) transcripts. The Drosha-Pasha/DGCR8 complex in the nucleus cleaves pri-miRNAs to release hairpin-shaped precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs). These pre-miRNAs are then exported to the cytoplasm and further processed by Dicer to mature miRNAs. Here we show that Drosophila Dicer-1 interacts with Loquacious, a double-stranded RNA-binding domain protein. Depletion of Loquacious results in pre-miRNA accumulation in Drosophila S2 cells, as is the case for depletion of Dicer-1. Immuno-affinity purification experiments revealed that along with Dicer-1, Loquacious resides in a functional pre-miRNA processing complex, and stimulates and directs the specific pre-miRNA processing activity. These results support a model in which Loquacious mediates miRNA biogenesis and, thereby, the expression of genes regulated by miRNAs."

        "abstract": "microRNAs (miRNAs) are single-stranded, 21- to 23-nucleotide cellular RNAs that control the expression of cognate target genes. Primary miRNA (pri-miRNA) transcripts are transformed to mature miRNA by the successive actions of two RNase III endonucleases. Drosha converts pri-miRNA transcripts to precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA); Dicer, in turn, converts pre-miRNA to mature miRNA. Here, we show that normal processing of Drosophila pre-miRNAs by Dicer-1 requires the double-stranded RNA-binding domain (dsRBD) protein Loquacious (Loqs), a homolog of human TRBP, a protein first identified as binding the HIV trans-activator RNA (TAR). Efficient miRNA-directed silencing of a reporter transgene, complete repression of white by a dsRNA trigger, and silencing of the endogenous Stellate locus by Suppressor of Stellate, all require Loqs. In loqs(f00791) mutant ovaries, germ-line stem cells are not appropriately maintained. Loqs associates with Dcr-1, the Drosophila RNase III enzyme that processes pre-miRNA into mature miRNA. Thus, every known Drosophila RNase-III endonuclease is paired with a dsRBD protein that facilitates its function in small RNA biogenesis."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs, about 21 nucleotides in length, that can regulate gene expression by base-pairing to partially complementary mRNAs. Regulation by miRNAs can play essential roles in embryonic development. We determined the temporal and spatial expression patterns of 115 conserved vertebrate miRNAs in zebrafish embryos by microarrays and by in situ hybridizations, using locked-nucleic acid-modified oligonucleotide probes. Most miRNAs were expressed in a highly tissue-specific manner during segmentation and later stages, but not early in development, which suggests that their role is not in tissue fate establishment but in differentiation or maintenance of tissue identity."

        "abstract": "RNA-directed DNA methylation, one of several RNA interference-mediated pathways in the nucleus, has been documented in plants and in human cells. Despite progress in identifying the DNA methyltransferases, histone-modifying enzymes and RNA interference proteins needed for RNA-directed DNA methylation, the mechanism remains incompletely understood. We screened for mutants defective in RNA-directed DNA methylation and silencing of a transgene promoter in Arabidopsis thaliana and identified three drd complementation groups. DRD1 is a SNF2-like protein required for RNA-directed de novo methylation. We report here that DRD2 and DRD3 correspond to the second-largest subunit and largest subunit, respectively, of a fourth class of DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (polymerase IV) that is unique to plants. DRD3 is a functionally diversified homolog of NRPD1a or SDE4, identified in a separate screen for mutants defective in post-transcriptional gene silencing. The identical DNA methylation patterns observed in all three drd mutants suggest that DRD proteins cooperate to create a substrate for RNA-directed de novo methylation."

This RNA-mediated regulation generally results in sequence-specific inhibition of gene expression; this can occur at levels as different as chromatin modification and silencing, translational repression and mRNA degradation. Many details of the biogenesis and function of miRNAs and siRNAs, and of the effector complexes with which they associate have been elucidated. The first structural information on protein components of the RNA interference (RNAi) and miRNA machineries is emerging, and provides some insight into the mechanism of RNA-silencing reactions."

        "abstract": "More than 90 different micro-ribonucleic acid (miRNA) encoding genes have been identified in Drosophila, yet the function of only two of these, bantam and DmiR-14, has been elucidated. In an effort to develop a general strategy for the analysis of miRNA function in Drosophila, two procedures were developed, in a Schneider line 2 cell culture system, which may be adapted to that end. First, we show that endogenous miRNAs can partially inhibit the expression of a transiently transfected reporter gene that has been modified to contain sequences complementary to that miRNA in the 3' UTR of a target messenger RNA (mRNA). Inhibition occurs by RNA interference (RNAi), which involves mRNA degradation. Second, we demonstrate that this miRNA-induced RNAi can be partially rescued with 2'-O-methyl oligonucleotides that contain sequences complementary to the cognate miRNA. We discuss how these techniques may be used, in vivo, both for localizing the tissue distribution of endogenous miRNAs during Drosophila development and identifying phenotypes associated with a loss of miRNA function."

        "title": "SV40-encoded microRNAs regulate viral gene expression and reduce susceptibility to cytotoxic T cells.",
        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small (approximately 22-nucleotide) RNAs that in lower organisms serve important regulatory roles in development and gene expression, typically by forming imperfect duplexes with target messenger RNAs. miRNAs have also been described in mammalian cells and in infections with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), but the function of most of them is unknown. Although one EBV miRNA probably altered the processing of a viral mRNA, the regulatory significance of this event is uncertain, because other transcripts exist that can supply the targeted function. Here we report the identification of miRNAs encoded by simian virus 40 (SV40) and define their functional significance for viral infection. SVmiRNAs accumulate at late times in infection, are perfectly complementary to early viral mRNAs, and target those mRNAs for cleavage. This reduces the expression of viral T antigens but does not reduce the yield of infectious virus relative to that generated by a mutant lacking SVmiRNAs. However, wild-type SV40-infected cells are less sensitive than the mutant to lysis by cytotoxic T cells, and trigger less cytokine production by such cells. Thus, viral evolution has taken advantage of the miRNA pathway to generate effectors that enhance the probability of successful infection."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) represent a family of small, regulatory, noncoding RNAs that are found in plants and animals. Here, we describe the miRNA profile of the zebrafish Danio rerio resolved in a developmental and cell-type-specific manner. The profiles were obtained from larger-scale sequencing of small RNA libraries prepared from developmentally staged zebrafish, and two adult fibroblast cell lines derived from the caudal fin (ZFL) and the liver epithelium (SJD). We identified a total of 154 distinct miRNAs expressed from 343 miRNA genes. Other experimental/computational sources support an additional 10 miRNAs encoded by 19 genes. The miRNAs can be classified into 87 distinct families. Cross-species comparison indicates that 81 families are conserved in mammals, 17 of which also have at least one member conserved in an invertebrate. Our analysis reveals that the zygotes are essentially devoid of miRNAs and that their expression begins during the blastula period with a zebrafish-specific family of miRNAs encoded by closely spaced multicopy genes. Computational predictions of zebrafish miRNA targets are provided that take into account the depth of evolutionary conservation. Besides miRNAs, we identified a prominent class of repeat-associated small interfering RNAs (rasiRNAs)."

        "abstract": "Small RNAs, including small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) can silence target genes through several different effector mechanisms. Whereas siRNA-directed mRNA cleavage is increasingly understood, the mechanisms by which miRNAs repress protein synthesis are obscure. Recent studies have revealed the existence of specific cytoplasmic foci, referred to herein as processing bodies (P-bodies), which contain untranslated mRNAs and can serve as sites of mRNA degradation. Here we demonstrate that Argonaute proteins--the signature components of the RNA interference (RNAi) effector complex, RISC--localize to mammalian P-bodies. Moreover, reporter mRNAs that are targeted for translational repression by endogenous or exogenous miRNAs become concentrated in P-bodies in a miRNA-dependent manner. These results provide a link between miRNA function and mammalian P-bodies and suggest that translation repression by RISC delivers mRNAs to P-bodies, either as a cause or as a consequence of inhibiting protein synthesis."

        "abstract": "A hallmark of RNA silencing is a class of approximately 22-nucleotide RNAs that are processed from double-stranded RNA precursors by Dicer. Accurate processing by Dicer is crucial for the functionality of microRNAs (miRNAs). The current model posits that Dicer selects cleavage sites by measuring a set distance from the 3' overhang of the double-stranded RNA terminus. Here we report that human Dicer anchors not only the 3' end but also the 5' end, with the cleavage site determined mainly by the distance (\u223c22 nucleotides) from the 5' end (5' counting rule). This cleavage requires a 5'-terminal phosphate group. Further, we identify a novel basic motif (5' pocket) in human Dicer that recognizes the 5'-phosphorylated end. The 5' counting rule and the 5' anchoring residues are conserved in Drosophila Dicer-1, but not in Giardia Dicer. Mutations in the 5' pocket reduce processing efficiency and alter cleavage sites in vitro. Consistently, miRNA biogenesis is perturbed in vivo when Dicer-null embryonic stem cells are replenished with the 5'-pocket mutant. Thus, 5'-end recognition by Dicer is important for precise and effective biogenesis of miRNAs. Insights from this study should also afford practical benefits to the design of small hairpin RNAs."

        "abstract": "During the last decade of the 20th century a totally novel way of gene regulation was revealed. Findings that at frst glance appeared freak features of plants or C. elegans turned out to be mechanistically related and deeply conserved throughout evolution. this important insight was primed by the landmark discovery of RNA interference, or RNAi, in 1998. This work started an entire novel feld of research, now usually referred to as RNA silencing. the common denominator of the phenomena grouped in this feld are small RNA molecules, often derived from double stranded RNA precursors, that in association with proteins of the so-called Argonaute family, are capable of directing a variety of effector complexes to cognate RNA and/or DNA molecules. one of these processes is now widely known as microRNA-mediated gene silencing and I will provide a partially historical framework of the many steps that have led to our current understanding of micro RNA biogenesis and function. this chapter is meant to provide a general overview of the various processes involved. for a comprehensive description of current models, I refer interested readers to the reviews and primary literature references provided in this chapter and to the further contents of this book."

        "abstract": "microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) play important roles in gene regulation and defense responses against transposons and viruses in eukaryotes. These small RNAs generally trigger the silencing of cognate sequences through a variety of mechanisms, including RNA degradation, translational inhibition and transcriptional repression. In the past few years, the synthesis and the mode of action of miRNAs and siRNAs have attracted great attention. However, relatively little is known about mechanisms of quality control during small RNA biogenesis as well as those that regulate mature small RNA stability. Recent studies in Arabidopsis thaliana and Caenorhabditis elegans have implicated 3'-to-5' (SDNs) and 5'-to-3' (XRN-2) exoribonucleases in mature miRNA turnover and the modulation of small RNA levels and activity. In the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a nucleotidyltransferase (MUT68) and an exosome subunit (RRP6) are involved in the 3' untemplated uridylation and the degradation of miRNAs and siRNAs. The latter enzymes appear to function as a quality control mechanism to eliminate putative dysfunctional or damaged small RNA molecules. Several post-transcriptional modifications of miRNAs and siRNAs such as 3' terminal methylation and untemplated nucleotide additions have also been reported to affect small RNA stability. These collective findings are beginning to uncover a new layer of regulatory control in the pathways involving small RNAs. We anticipate that understanding the mechanisms of mature miRNA and siRNA turnover will have direct implications for fundamental biology as well as for applications of RNA interference technology."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that can function as either powerful tumor promoters or suppressors in numerous types of cancer. The ability of miRs to target multiple genes and biological signaling pathways has created intense interest in their potential clinical utility as predictive and diagnostic biomarkers, and as innovative therapeutic agents. Recently, accumulating preclinical studies have illustrated the feasibility of slowing tumor progression by either overexpressing tumor suppressive miRNAs, or by neutralizing the activities of oncogenic miRNAs in cell- and animal-based models of cancer. Here we highlight prominent miRNAs that may represent potential therapeutic targets in human malignancies, as well as review current technologies available for inactivating or restoring miRNA activity in clinical settings."

        "abstract": "Referred to as the micromanagers of gene expression, microRNAs (miRNAs) are evolutionarily conserved small noncoding RNAs. Polymorphisms in the miRNA pathway (miR-polymorphisms) are emerging as powerful tools to study the biology of a disease and have the potential to be used in disease prognosis and diagnosis. Detection of miR-polymorphisms holds promise in the field of miRNA pharmacogenomics, molecular epidemiology and for individualized medicine. MiRNA pharmacogenomics can be defined as the study of miRNAs and polymorphisms affecting miRNA function in order to predict drug behavior and to improve drug efficacy. Advancements in the miRNA field indicate the clear involvement of miRNAs and genetic variations within the miRNA pathway in the progression and prognosis of diseases such as cancer, neurological disorders, muscular hypertrophy, gastric mucosal atrophy, cardiovascular disease and Type II diabetes. Various algorithms are available to predict miRNA-target mRNA sites; however, it is advisable to use multiple algorithms to confirm the predictions. Polymorphisms that may potentially affect miRNA-mediated regulation of the cell can be present not only in the 3 -UTR of a miRNA target gene, but also in the genes involved in miRNA biogenesis and in pri-, pre- and mature-miRNA sequences. A polymorphism in processed miRNAs may affect expression of several genes and have serious consequences, whereas a polymorphism in miRNA target site, in the 3 -UTR of the target mRNA, may be more target and/or pathway specific. In this review, we for the first time suggest a classification of miRNA polymorphisms/mutations. We also describe the importance and implications of miR-polymorphisms in gene regulation, disease progression, pharmacogenomics and molecular epidemiology."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are recently discovered short non-coding RNA molecules that negatively regulate messenger RNA (mRNA) translation to protein. Their discovery heralds a novel mechanism of post-transcriptional gene regulation and has lead to a cascade of studies aimed at identifying how miRNA dysregulation may contribute to disease. Recent studies have provided indisputable evidence for a role of miRNAs in normal haematopoiesis adding a further layer of complexity to the regulatory process. Leukaemia and lymphoma are characterised by dysregulation of survival and differentiation in haematopoietic progenitor cells. There are several lines of evidence supporting the notion that miRNA dysfunction is contributory, whether by extrapolation from miRNA-mediated oncogenesis in other disorders, by miRNA profiling, or by in vivo and in vitro functional studies of miRNAs in haematological malignancies. Further work is underway to delineate the role of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of malignant blood disorders, with the eventual hope that this will aid in the diagnosis and the development of potential novel cures for such diseases, many of which still have an unacceptable prognosis."

However, the broad and important functions of these regulators are only now becoming apparent. The expansion of our catalogue of miRNA genes and the identification of the genes they regulate owe much to the development of sophisticated computational tools that have helped either to focus or interpret experimental assays. In this article, we review the methods for miRNA gene finding and target identification that have been proposed in the last few years. We identify some problems that current approaches have not yet been able to overcome and we offer some perspectives on the next generation of computational methods."

        "abstract": "Genomic studies in model organisms and in humans have shown that complexity in biological systems arises not from the absolute number of genes, but from the differential use of combinations of genetic programmes and the myriad ways in which these are regulated spatially and temporally during development, senescence and in disease. Nowhere is this lesson in biological complexity likely to be more apparent than in the human nervous system. Increasingly, the role of genomic non-protein coding small regulatory RNAs, in particular the microRNAs (miRNAs), in regulating cellular pathways controlling fundamental functions in the nervous system and in neurodegenerative disease is being appreciated. Not only might dysregulated expression of miRNAs serve as potential disease biomarkers but increasingly such short regulatory RNAs are being implicated directly in the pathogenesis of complex, sporadic neurodegenerative disease. Moreover, the targeting and exploitation of short RNA silencing pathways, commonly known as RNA interference, and the development of related tools, offers novel therapeutic approaches to target upstream disease components with the promise of providing future disease modifying therapies for neurodegenerative disorders."

The GW182 protein is a key component of miRNA repression complex, recruited by Argonaute and functioning downstream to repress translation and accelerate mRNA degradation, but little is known about how GW182 proteins act. Using both tethered function and complementation assays, we identify three independent domains of the Drosophila GW182 protein (also termed Gawky) that are sufficient to repress mRNA. Each of these domains also functions independently of poly(A) tails. These results indicate that miRNA-mediated repression is facilitated by multiple domains of GW182."

        "abstract": "Proteins of the GW182 family play an important role in the execution of microRNA repression in metazoa. They interact directly with Argonaute proteins, components of microRNPs, and also form part of P-bodies, structures implicated in translational repression and mRNA degradation. Recent results demonstrated that Drosophila GW182 has the potential to both repress translation and accelerate mRNA deadenylation and decay. In contrast to a single GW182 protein in Drosophila, the three GW182 paralogs TNRC6A, TNRC6B, and TNRC6C are encoded in mammalian genomes. In this study, we provide evidence that TNRC6C, like TNRC6A and TNRC6B, is important for efficient miRNA repression. We further demonstrate that tethering of each of the human TNRC6 proteins to a reporter mRNA has a dramatic inhibitory effect on protein synthesis. The repression is due to a combination of effects on the mRNA level and mRNA translation. Through deletion and mutagenesis, we identified the C-terminal part of TNRC6C encompassing the RRM RNA-binding motif as a key effector domain mediating protein synthesis repression by TNRC6C."

        "title": "Small RNA deep sequencing reveals role for Arabidopsis thaliana RNA-dependent RNA polymerases in viral siRNA biogenesis.",
        "abstract": "RNA silencing functions as an important antiviral defense mechanism in a broad range of eukaryotes. In plants, biogenesis of several classes of endogenous small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) requires RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase (RDR) activities. Members of the RDR family proteins, including RDR1and RDR6, have also been implicated in antiviral defense, although a direct role for RDRs in viral siRNA biogenesis has yet to be demonstrated. Using a crucifer-infecting strain of Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV-Cg) and Arabidopsis thaliana as a model system, we analyzed the viral small RNA profile in wild-type plants as well as rdr mutants by applying small RNA deep sequencing technology. Over 100,000 TMV-Cg-specific small RNA reads, mostly of 21- (78.4%) and 22-nucleotide (12.9%) in size and originating predominately (79.9%) from the genomic sense RNA strand, were captured at an early infection stage, yielding the first high-resolution small RNA map for a plant virus. The TMV-Cg genome harbored multiple, highly reproducible small RNA-generating hot spots that corresponded to regions with no apparent local hairpin-forming capacity. Significantly, both the rdr1 and rdr6 mutants exhibited globally reduced levels of viral small RNA production as well as reduced strand bias in viral small RNA population, revealing an important role for these host RDRs in viral siRNA biogenesis. In addition, an informatics analysis showed that a large set of host genes could be potentially targeted by TMV-Cg-derived siRNAs for posttranscriptional silencing. Two of such predicted host targets, which encode a cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF30) and an unknown protein similar to translocon-associated protein alpha (TRAP alpha), respectively, yielded a positive result in cleavage validation by 5'RACE assays. Our data raised the interesting possibility for viral siRNA-mediated virus-host interactions that may contribute to viral pathogenicity and host specificity."

The past decade has seen an explosion in our understanding of the sets of miRNA genes encoded in the genomes in different species of plants and the mechanisms by which miRNAs interact with target RNAs. A subset of miRNA families (and their binding sites in target RNAs) are conserved between angiosperms and basal plants, suggesting they predate the divergence of existing lineages of plants. However, the majority of miRNA families expressed by any given plant species have a narrow phylogenetic distribution. As a group, these \"young\" miRNAs genes appear to be evolutionarily fluid and lack clearly understood biological function. The goal of this review is to summarize our understanding of the sets of miRNA genes and miRNA targets that exist in various plant species and to discuss hypotheses that explain the patterns of conservation and divergence observed among microRNAs in plants."

Three observations suggested that miRNA genes might be identified using a computational approach. First, miRNAs generally derive from precursor transcripts of 70-100 nucleotides with extended stem-loop structure. Second, miRNAs are usually highly conserved between the genomes of related species.

        "abstract": "Spermatogenesis is a strictly regulated process, at both the transcriptional and the posttranscriptional level, which allows continuous gamete production throughout adulthood. A novel mechanism of posttranscriptional control mediated by microRNAs (miRNAs) has lately emerged as an important regulator of spermatogenesis. miRNAs are endogenous, small, noncoding RNAs produced through a multistep enzymatic process, which involves the action of Dicer, an RNaseIII endonuclease. Here, we first present a short overview of classic posttranscriptional control during spermatogenesis, and then concentrate on recent findings that have unraveled the important role of miRNAs in male reproductive function. Particular focus is given to the in vivo role of miRNAs that has been demonstrated through the generation of Sertoli cell-specific or germ cell-specific Dicer knockouts, as well as the potential application of these findings in the treatment of human male infertility and the development of male contraceptives. It is anticipated that unraveling miRNA functions in the testis will further our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of mammalian spermatogenesis."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are approximately 22 nucleotide long, noncoding, endogenous RNA molecules which exert their functions by base pairing with messenger RNAs (mRNAs), thereby regulate protein-coding gene expression. In eukaryotic cells, miRNAs play important roles in regulating biological processes such as proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and stem cell self-renewal. The human genome may contain as many as 1,000 miRNAs, and more than 700 of them have been identified. miRNAs are predicted to target up to one third of mRNAs. Each miRNA can target hundreds of transcripts directly or indirectly, while more than one miRNA can converge on a single transcript target. Therefore, the potential regulatory circuitry afforded by miRNA is enormous. Recently, mounting evidence implicates miRNAs as a new class of modulator for human tumor initiation and progression. Therefore, it has been proposed that manipulating miRNA activity and miRNA biogenesis may be a novel avenue for developing efficient therapies against cancer."

        "abstract": "Understanding complex diseases such as sporadic Alzheimer disease (AD) has been a major challenge. Unlike the familial forms of AD, the genetic and environmental risks factors identified for sporadic AD are extensive. MicroRNAs are one of the major noncoding RNAs that function as negative regulators to silence or suppress gene expression via translational inhibition or message degradation. Their discovery has evoked great excitement in biomedical research for their promise as potential disease biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Key microRNAs have been identified as essential for a variety of cellular events including cell lineage determination, proliferation, apoptosis, DNA repair, and cytoskeletal organization; most, if not all, acting to fine-tune gene expression at the post-transcriptional level in a host of cellular signaling networks. Dysfunctional microRNA-mediated regulation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of many disease states. Here, the current understanding of the role of miRNAs in the central nervous system is reviewed with emphasis on their impact on the etiopathogenesis of sporadic AD."

        "abstract": "Women outlive men, but life expectancy is not influenced by hormone replacement (estrogen + progestin) therapy. Estrogens appear to protect brain, cardiovascular tissues, and bone from aging. Estrogens regulate genes directly through binding to estrogen receptors alpha and beta (ERalpha and ERbeta) that are ligand-activated transcription factors and indirectly by activating plasma membrane-associated ER which, in turns, activates intracellular signaling cascades leading to altered gene expression. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short (19-25 nucleotides), naturally-occurring, non-coding RNA molecules that base-pair with the 3' untranslated region of target mRNAs. This interaction either blocks translation of the mRNA or targets the mRNA transcript to be degraded. The human genome contains ~ 700-1,200 miRNAs. Aberrant patterns of miRNA expression are implicated in human diseases including breast cancer. Recent studies have identified miRNAs regulated by estrogens in human breast cancer cells, human endometrial stromal and myometrial smooth muscle cells, rat mammary gland, and mouse uterus. The decline of estradiol levels in postmenopausal women has been implicated in various age-associated disorders. The role of estrogen-regulated miRNA expression, the target genes of these miRNAs, and the role of miRNAs in aging has yet to be explored."

        "abstract": "For 50 years the term 'gene' has been synonymous with regions of the genome encoding mRNAs that are translated into protein. However, recent genome-wide studies have shown that the human genome is pervasively transcribed and produces many thousands of regulatory non-protein-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), including microRNAs, small interfering RNAs, PIWI-interacting RNAs and various classes of long ncRNAs. It is now clear that these RNAs fulfil critical roles as transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulators and as guides of chromatin-modifying complexes. Here we review the biology of ncRNAs, focusing on the fundamental mechanisms by which ncRNAs facilitate normal development and physiology and, when dysfunctional, underpin disease. We also discuss evidence that intergenic regions associated with complex diseases express ncRNAs, as well as the potential use of ncRNAs as diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets. Taken together, these observations emphasize the need to move beyond the confines of protein-coding genes and highlight the fact that continued investigation of ncRNA biogenesis and function will be necessary for a comprehensive understanding of human disease."

        "abstract": "microRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small RNAs (19-25 nucleotides in length) processed from double-stranded hairpin precursors. They negatively regulate gene expression in animals, by binding, with imperfect base pairing, to target sites in messenger RNAs (usually in 3' untranslated regions) thereby either reducing translational efficiency or determining transcript degradation. Considering that each miRNA can regulate, on average, the expression of approximately several hundred target genes, the miRNA apparatus can participate in the control of the gene expression of a large quota of mammalian transcriptomes and proteomes. As a consequence, miRNAs are expected to regulate various developmental and physiological processes, such as the development and function of many tissue and organs. Due to the strong impact of miRNAs on the biological processes, it is expected that mutations affecting miRNA function have a pathogenic role in human genetic diseases, similar to protein-coding genes. In this review, we provide an overview of the evidence available to date which support the pathogenic role of miRNAs in human genetic diseases. We will first describe the main types of mutation mechanisms affecting miRNA function that can result in human genetic disorders, namely: (1) mutations affecting miRNA sequences; (2) mutations in the recognition sites for miRNAs harboured in target mRNAs; and (3) mutations in genes that participate in the general processes of miRNA processing and function. Finally, we will also describe the results of recent studies, mostly based on animal models, indicating the phenotypic consequences of miRNA alterations on the function of several tissues and organs. These studies suggest that the spectrum of genetic diseases possibly caused by mutations in miRNAs is wide and is only starting to be unravelled."

This review describes miRNA regulation and function in tissue response to acute ischemia. We focused our attention on a subset of miRNAs that have been found de-regulated in different studies, suggesting that they may represent \"master ischemic\" miRNAs, playing a pathogenetic role in different components of tissue response to ischemia. First, we analyzed the role of miRNAs in cell response to hypoxia, a crucial component of ischemia, and in angiogenesis. Then, we describe miRNAs role in acute myocardial infarction as much as in hindlimb, cerebral, hepatic and retinal ischemia. The role played by specific miRNAs in the regulation of apoptosis, fibrosis, regeneration and myocardial arrhythmias is illustrated. The identification of specific miRNAs as key regulators of the response to ischemia has opened new clinical avenues. miRNAs may constitute excellent non-invasive disease biomarkers. Furthermore, innovative strategies targeting miRNAs, aimed to reduce the levels of pathogenic or aberrantly expressed miRNAs or to elevate the levels of miRNAs with beneficial functions, have been developed and could be applied in the treatment of ischemic diseases."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression posttranscriptionally by interfering with a target mRNA's translation, stability, or both. We sought to dissect the respective contributions of translational inhibition and mRNA decay to microRNA regulation. We identified direct targets of a specific miRNA, miR-124, by virtue of their association with Argonaute proteins, core components of miRNA effector complexes, in response to miR-124 transfection in human tissue culture cells. In parallel, we assessed mRNA levels and obtained translation profiles using a novel global approach to analyze polysomes separated on sucrose gradients. Analysis of translation profiles for approximately 8,000 genes in these proliferative human cells revealed that basic features of translation are similar to those previously observed in rapidly growing Saccharomyces cerevisiae. For approximately 600 mRNAs specifically recruited to Argonaute proteins by miR-124, we found reductions in both the mRNA abundance and inferred translation rate spanning a large dynamic range. The changes in mRNA levels of these miR-124 targets were larger than the changes in translation, with average decreases of 35% and 12%, respectively. Further, there was no identifiable subgroup of mRNA targets for which the translational response was dominant. Both ribosome occupancy (the fraction of a given gene's transcripts associated with ribosomes) and ribosome density (the average number of ribosomes bound per unit length of coding sequence) were selectively reduced for hundreds of miR-124 targets by the presence of miR-124. Changes in protein abundance inferred from the observed changes in mRNA abundance and translation profiles closely matched changes directly determined by Western analysis for 11 of 12 proteins, suggesting that our assays captured most of miR-124-mediated regulation. These results suggest that miRNAs inhibit translation initiation or stimulate ribosome drop-off preferentially near the start site and are not consistent with inhibition of polypeptide elongation, or nascent polypeptide degradation contributing significantly to miRNA-mediated regulation in proliferating HEK293T cells. The observation of concordant changes in mRNA abundance and translational rate for hundreds of miR-124 targets is consistent with a functional link between these two regulatory outcomes of miRNA targeting, and the well-documented interrelationship between translation and mRNA decay."

        "abstract": "In the last years it has become increasingly clear that the mammalian transcriptome is highly complex and includes a large number of small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). Here we review the biogenesis pathways of the three classes of sncRNAs, namely short interfering RNAs (siRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs) and PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs). These ncRNAs have been extensively studied and are involved in pathways leading to specific gene silencing and the protection of genomes against virus and transposons, for example. Also, lncRNAs have emerged as pivotal molecules for the transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression which is supported by their tissue-specific expression patterns, subcellular distribution, and developmental regulation. Therefore, we also focus our attention on their role in differentiation and development. SncRNAs and lncRNAs play critical roles in defining DNA methylation patterns, as well as chromatin remodeling thus having a substantial effect in epigenetics. The identification of some overlaps in their biogenesis pathways and functional roles raises the hypothesis that these molecules play concerted functions in vivo, creating complex regulatory networks where cooperation with regulatory proteins is necessary. We also highlighted the implications of biogenesis and gene expression deregulation of sncRNAs and lncRNAs in human diseases like cancer."

        "abstract": "The c-Myc oncogenic transcription factor (Myc) is pathologically activated in many human malignancies. Myc is known to directly upregulate a pro-tumorigenic group of microRNAs (miRNAs) known as the miR-17-92 cluster. Through the analysis of human and mouse models of B cell lymphoma, we show here that Myc regulates a much broader set of miRNAs than previously anticipated. Unexpectedly, the predominant consequence of activation of Myc is widespread repression of miRNA expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation reveals that much of this repression is likely to be a direct result of Myc binding to miRNA promoters. We further show that enforced expression of repressed miRNAs diminishes the tumorigenic potential of lymphoma cells. These results demonstrate that extensive reprogramming of the miRNA transcriptome by Myc contributes to tumorigenesis."

        "abstract": "During the past decade, small non-coding RNAs have rapidly emerged as important contributors to gene regulation. To carry out their biological functions, these small RNAs require a unique class of proteins called Argonautes. The discovery and our comprehension of this highly conserved protein family is closely linked to the study of RNA-based gene silencing mechanisms. With their functional domains, Argonaute proteins can bind small non-coding RNAs and control protein synthesis, affect messenger RNA stability and even participate in the production of a new class of small RNAs, Piwi-interacting RNAs."

        "title": "MicroRNAs as targets for antisense-based therapeutics.",
        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a novel class of endogenous non-coding single-stranded RNAs, which regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally by base pairing with their target mRNAs. So far > 5000 miRNA entries have been registered and miRNAs have been implicated in most, if not all, central cellular processes and several diseases. As the mechanism of action for miRNA regulation of target mRNAs is mediated by Watson-Crick base pairing, antisense oligonucleotides targeting the miRNAs appear as an obvious choice to specifically inhibit miRNA function. Indeed, miRNAs can be antagonized in vivo by oligonucleotides composed of high-affinity nucleotide mimics. Lessons learned from traditional antisense strategies and small-interfering RNA approaches, that is from potent nucleotide mimics, design rules, pharmacokinetics, administration and safety issues, are likely to pave the way for future clinical trials of miRNA-antagonizing oligonucleotides."

        "title": "Dual role for argonautes in microRNA processing and posttranscriptional regulation of microRNA expression.",
        "abstract": "MicroRNAs are small endogenous noncoding RNAs involved in posttranscriptional gene regulation. During microRNA biogenesis, Drosha and Dicer process the primary transcript (pri-miRNA) through a precursor hairpin (pre-miRNA) to the mature miRNA. The miRNA is incorporated into the RNA-Induced Silencing Complex (RISC) with Argonaute proteins, the effector molecules in RNA interference (RNAi). Here, we show that all Argonautes elevate mature miRNA expression posttranscriptionally, independent of RNase activity. Also, we identify a role for the RISC slicer Argonaute2 (Ago2) in cleaving the pre-miRNA to an additional processing intermediate, termed Ago2-cleaved precursor miRNA or ac-pre-miRNA. This endogenous, on-pathway intermediate results from cleavage of the pre-miRNA hairpin 12 nucleotides from its 3'-end. By analogy to siRNA processing, Ago2 cleavage may facilitate removal of the nicked passenger strand from RISC after maturation. The multiple roles of Argonautes in the RNAi effector phase and miRNA biogenesis and maturation suggest coordinate regulation of microRNA expression and function."

        "abstract": "Cancers may arise from rare self-renewing tumor-initiating cells (T-IC). However, how T-IC self renewal, multipotent differentiation, and tumorigenicity are maintained remains obscure. Because miRNAs can regulate cell-fate decisions, we compared miRNA expression in self-renewing and differentiated cells from breast cancer lines and in breast T-IC (BT-IC) and non-BT-IC from 1 degrees breast cancers. let-7 miRNAs were markedly reduced in BT-IC and increased with differentiation. Infecting BT-IC with let-7-lentivirus reduced proliferation, mammosphere formation, and the proportion of undifferentiated cells in vitro and tumor formation and metastasis in NOD/SCID mice, while antagonizing let-7 by antisense oligonucleotides enhanced in vitro self renewal of non-T-IC. Increased let-7 paralleled reduced H-RAS and HMGA2, known let-7 targets. Silencing H-RAS in a BT-IC-enriched cell line reduced self renewal but had no effect on differentiation, while silencing HMGA2 enhanced differentiation but did not affect self renewal. Therefore let-7 regulates multiple BT-IC stem cell-like properties by silencing more than one target."

We report the generation of deletion mutations in 87 miRNA genes in Caenorhabditis elegans, expanding the number of mutated miRNA genes to 95, or 83% of known C. elegans miRNAs. We find that the majority of miRNAs are not essential for the viability or development of C. elegans, and mutations in most miRNA genes do not result in grossly abnormal phenotypes. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that there is significant functional redundancy among miRNAs or among gene pathways regulated by miRNAs. This study represents the first comprehensive genetic analysis of miRNA function in any organism and provides a unique, permanent resource for the systematic study of miRNAs."

The unique expression profiles of different miRNAs in different types of cancers and at different stages in one cancer type suggest that miRNAs can function as novel biomarkers for disease diagnostics and may present a new strategy for miRNA gene therapy. Anti-miRNAs and antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) have been employed to inhibit specific miRNA expression in vitro and in vivo for investigational and clinical purposes. Although miRNA-based diagnostics and gene therapy are still in their infancy, their huge potentials will meet our need for future disease diagnostics and gene therapy. High efficient delivery of miRNAs into targeted sites, designing accurate anti-miRNA/ASOs, and related biosafety issues are three major challenges in this field."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small regulatory RNAs that are thought to regulate the expression of as many as one-third of all human messenger RNAs (mRNAs). miRNAs are thought to be involved in diverse biological processes, including tumorigenesis. Analysis of miRNA levels may have diagnostic implications. Evidence shows that numerous viruses interact with the miRNA machinery, and that a number of viruses encode their own miRNAs. It seems likely that miRNAs will be implicated in many human diseases. Manipulation of miRNA levels by gene therapy provides an attractive new approach for therapeutic development. This review focuses on approaches to manipulate miRNA levels in cells and in vivo, and the implications for gene therapy. Furthermore, we discuss the use of endogenous miRNAs as scaffolds for the expression of RNA interference (RNAi) as well as competition between exogenous RNAi triggers and endogenous miRNAs. Because short interfering RNAs can also act as miRNAs, seed matches with the 3' untranslated regions of genes should be avoided to prevent off-target effects. Last, we discuss the use of miRNAs to avoid immune responses to viral vectors."

        "abstract": "Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) guide catalytic sequence-specific cleavage of fully or nearly fully complementary target mRNAs or control translation and/or stability of many mRNAs that share 6-8 nucleotides (nt) of complementarity to the siRNA and miRNA 5' end. siRNA- and miRNA-containing ribonucleoprotein silencing complexes are assembled from double-stranded 21- to 23-nt RNase III processing intermediates that carry 5' phosphates and 2-nt overhangs with free 3' hydroxyl groups. Despite the structural symmetry of a duplex siRNA, the nucleotide sequence asymmetry can generate a bias for preferred loading of one of the two duplex-forming strands into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). Here we show that the 5'-phosphorylation status of the siRNA strands also acts as an important determinant for strand selection. 5'-O-methylated siRNA duplexes refractory to 5' phosphorylation were examined for their biases in siRNA strand selection. Asymmetric, single methylation of siRNA duplexes reduced the occupancy of the silencing complex by the methylated strand with concomitant elimination of its off-targeting signature and enhanced off-targeting signature of the phosphorylated strand. Methylation of both siRNA strands reduced but did not completely abolish RNA silencing, without affecting strand selection relative to that of the unmodified siRNA. We conclude that asymmetric 5' modification of siRNA duplexes can be useful for controlling targeting specificity."

        "abstract": "As sessile organisms, plants have to cope with the ever-changing environment as well as with numerous forms of stress. To react to these external cues, plants have evolved a suite of response mechanisms operating at many different levels, ranging from physiological to molecular processes that provide the organism with a wide phenotypic plasticity, allowing for fine tuning of the reactions to these adverse circumstances. During the past decade, non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) have emerged as key regulatory molecules, which contribute to a significant portion of the transcriptome in eukaryotes and are involved in the control of transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene regulatory pathways. Although accumulated evidence supports an important role for ncRNAs in plant response and adaptation to abiotic stress, their mechanism(s) of action still remains obscure and a functional characterization of the ncRNA repertoire in plants is still needed. Moreover, common features in the biogenesis of different small ncRNAs, and in some cases, cross talk between different gene regulatory pathways may add to the complexity of these pathways and could play important roles in modulating stress responses. Here we review the various ncRNAs that have been reported to participate in the response to abiotic stress in plants, focusing on their importance in plant adaptation and evolution. Understanding how ncRNAs work may reveal novel mechanisms involved in the plant responses to the environment."

        "abstract": "microRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNAs with critical roles in fine-tuning a wide array of biological processes including development, metabolism, and homeostasis. miRNAs expression, similarly to that of protein-coding genes, is regulated by multiple transcriptional networks as well as the epigenetic machinery. miRNA genes can be epigenetically regulated by DNA methylation or specific histone modifications. In addition, miRNAs can themselves repress key enzymes that drive epigenetic remodeling, generating regulatory circuits that have a significant effect in the transcriptional landscape of the cell. Recent evidences also suggest that miRNAs can directly modulate gene transcription in the nucleus through the recognition of specific target sites in promoter regions. Given the widespread distribution of epigenetic marks and miRNA target sites in the genome, the regulatory circuits linking both mechanisms are likely to have a major impact in genome transcription and cell physiology. Not surprisingly, tumor-associated aberrations in the miRNA or epigenetic machineries are widely distributed in human cancer, and we are just starting to understand their relevance in diagnosis, prognosis or therapy."

We also address the issue of cellular localization of miRNA-mediated events and a role for RNA-binding proteins in activation or relief of miRNA repression."

It has become apparent that they are also key factors in cancer, playing both oncogenic and tumour-suppressing roles. We discuss here what is known of miR biology in the normal breast, and of their emerging roles in breast cancer."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNAs that inhibit the expression of target genes by directly binding to their mRNAs. miRNAs are transcribed as precursor molecules, which are subsequently cleaved by the endoribonucleases Drosha and Dicer. Mature miRNAs are bound by a member of the Argonaute (AGO) protein family to form the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) in a process termed RISC loading. Advances in structural analyses of Drosha and Dicer complexes enabled elucidation of the mechanisms that drive these molecular machines. Transcription of miRNAs, their processing by Drosha and Dicer and RISC loading are key steps in miRNA biogenesis, and various additional factors facilitate, support or inhibit these processes. Recent work has revealed that regulatory factors not only coordinate individual miRNA processing steps but also connect miRNA biogenesis with other cellular processes. Protein phosphorylation, for example, links miRNA biogenesis to various signalling pathways, and such modifications are often associated with disease. Furthermore, not all miRNAs follow canonical processing routes, and many non-canonical miRNA biogenesis pathways have recently been characterized."

        "abstract": "Chemically synthesised 21-23 bp double-stranded short interfering RNAs (siRNA) can induce sequence-specific post-transcriptional gene silencing, in a process termed RNA interference (RNAi). In the present study, several siRNAs synthesised against different sites on the same target mRNA (human Tissue Factor) demonstrated striking differences in silencing efficiency. Only a few of the siRNAs resulted in a significant reduction in expression, suggesting that accessible siRNA target sites may be rare in some human mRNAs. Blocking of the 3'-OH with FITC did not reduce the effect on target mRNA. Mutations in the siRNAs relative to target mRNA sequence gradually reduced, but did not abolish mRNA depletion. Inactive siRNAs competed reversibly with active siRNAs in a sequence-independent manner. Several lines of evidence suggest the existence of a near equilibrium kinetic balance between mRNA production and siRNA-mediated mRNA depletion. The silencing effect was transient, with the level of mRNA recovering fully within 4-5 days, suggesting absence of a propagative system for RNAi in humans. Finally, we observed 3' mRNA cleavage fragments resulting from the action of the most effective siRNAs. The depletion rate-dependent appearance of these fragments argues for the existence of a two-step mRNA degradation mechanism."

        "abstract": "Mutations in the ARGONAUTE gene ZIPPY(ZIP)/AGO7 in Arabidopsis accelerate the juvenile-to-adult transition. A screen for mutations that suppress this precocious phenotype yielded alleles of two auxin-related transcription factors known to be upregulated in zip: ETTIN (ETT)/ARF3 and ARF4. Mutations in ETT/ARF3 and ARF4 delay the expression of adult traits, demonstrating that these genes have non-redundant roles in shoot maturation. ZIP is not generally required for the production of trans-acting (ta) siRNAs, but is required for the production and/or stability of tasiR-ARF, a ta-siRNA that targets both ETT/ARF3 and ARF4. tasiR-ARF is absent in zip-2, and overexpression of a tasiR-ARF-insensitive form of ETT mimics the zip phenotype. We conclude that the precocious phenotype of zip is attributable to the absence of tasiR-ARF-mediated repression of ETT and ARF4. The abundance of tasiR-ARF, ETT/ARF3 and ARF4 RNA does not change during vegetative development. This result suggests that tasiR-ARF regulation establishes the threshold at which leaves respond to a temporal signal, rather than being a component of this signal."

        "title": "Running interference: prospects and obstacles to using small interfering RNAs as small molecule drugs.",
        "abstract": "RNA interference (RNAi) is a well-conserved, ubiquitous, endogenous mechanism that uses small noncoding RNAs to silence gene expression. The endogenous small RNAs, called microRNAs, are processed from hairpin precursors and regulate important genes involved in cell death, differentiation, and development. RNAi also protects the genome from invading genetic elements, encoded by transposons and viruses. When small double-stranded RNAs, called small interfering (si)RNAs, are introduced into cells, they bind to the endogenous RNAi machinery to disrupt the expression of mRNAs containing complementary sequences with high specificity. Any disease-causing gene and any cell type or tissue can potentially be targeted. This technique has been rapidly utilized for gene-function analysis and drug-target discovery and validation. Harnessing RNAi also holds great promise for therapy, although introducing siRNAs into cells in vivo remains an important obstacle. Pilot siRNA clinical studies began just three years after the discovery that RNAi works in mammalian cells. This review discusses recent progress and obstacles to using siRNAs as small molecule drugs."

        "abstract": "In Arabidopsis thaliana, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) direct cytosine methylation at endogenous DNA repeats in a pathway involving two forms of nuclear RNA polymerase IV (Pol IVa and Pol IVb), RNA-DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASE 2 (RDR2), DICER-LIKE 3 (DCL3), ARGONAUTE4 (AGO4), the chromatin remodeler DRD1, and the de novo cytosine methyltransferase DRM2. We show that RDR2, DCL3, AGO4, and NRPD1b (the largest subunit of Pol IVb) colocalize with siRNAs within the nucleolus. By contrast, Pol IVa and DRD1 are external to the nucleolus and colocalize with endogenous repeat loci. Mutation-induced loss of pathway proteins causes downstream proteins to mislocalize, revealing their order of action. Pol IVa acts first, and its localization is RNA dependent, suggesting an RNA template. We hypothesize that maintenance of the heterochromatic state involves locus-specific Pol IVa transcription followed by siRNA production and assembly of AGO4- and NRPD1b-containing silencing complexes within nucleolar processing centers."

        "abstract": "ARGONAUTE4 (AGO4) and RNA polymerase IV (Pol IV) are required for DNA methylation guided by 24 nucleotide small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in Arabidopsis thaliana. Here we show that AGO4 localizes to nucleolus-associated bodies along with the Pol IV subunit NRPD1b; the small nuclear RNA (snRNA) binding protein SmD3; and two markers of Cajal bodies, trimethylguanosine-capped snRNAs and the U2 snRNA binding protein U2B''. AGO4 interacts with the C-terminal domain of NRPD1b, and AGO4 protein stability depends on upstream factors that synthesize siRNAs. AGO4 is also found, along with the DNA methyltransferase DRM2, throughout the nucleus at presumed DNA methylation target sites. Cajal bodies are conserved sites for the maturation of ribonucleoprotein complexes. Our results suggest a function for Cajal bodies as a center for the assembly of an AGO4/NRPD1b/siRNA complex, facilitating its function in RNA-directed gene silencing at target loci."

        "abstract": "Mature microRNAs (miRNAs) are single-stranded RNA molecules of 17-24 nucleotides (nt) in length that are encoded in the genomes of plants and animals. The seminal discoveries of miRNA made in C. elegans have led the way to the rampant discoveries being made today in this field. Since each miRNA is predicted and in some cases confirmed to regulate multiple genes, the potential regulatory circuitry afforded by miRNAs is thought to be enormous and could amount to regulation of >30% of all human genes. Due to the sequences of many of the miRNAs being highly homologous among organisms, the huge potential of miRNAs to regulate gene expression, and the hints of miRNAs being useful in both diagnostics and therapeutics, it is no wonder these small RNAs are gaining such popularity in both the academic and industrial settings. It is now becoming clear that the miRNA gene class represents a very important gene regulatory network. This article reviews the initial discoveries of miRNA that began in the nematode C. elegans, and extends into what is known about miRNAs and miRNA processing factors in mouse development and human disease."

As one kind of such functional noncoding RNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs) form a class of endogenous 19-23-nucleotide RNAs that can have important regulatory roles in animals and plants by targeting transcripts for cleavage or translational repression. Since the discovery of the very first miRNAs, computational methods have been an invaluable tool that can complement experimental approaches to understand the biology of miRNAs. Most computational approaches associated with miRNA research can be classified into two broad categories, namely miRNA gene identification and miRNA target prediction. In this review, we summarize the principles of in silico prediction of miRNAs and their targets, and provide a comprehensive survey of specific methods that have been proposed in the field."

Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to regulate protein dosage during mammalian development. miRNAs are tiny RNA molecules that function to regulate diverse cellular processes by inhibiting gene expression posttranscriptionally. Since their discovery in mammals in 2000, much has been learned about the biogenesis, mechanisms of action, and expression of miRNAs. This knowledge combined with the identification of new mRNA targets has provided valuable insights into the functions of these RNA regulatory molecules. It is now clear that miRNAs are involved in modulating a variety of developmental and physiological processes. This review is designed to highlight recent advances in the study of miRNAs with a particular emphasis on their roles in mammalian development and cancer progression."

These small, 18-22-nucleotide (nt) RNAs are transcribed as parts of longer molecules called pri-miRNAs, which are processed in the nucleus into hairpin RNAs of 70-100 nt, called pre-miRNAs, by the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-specific ribonuclease Drosha. The function of most miRNAs is not known, but for a few members the participation in essential biological processes for the eukaryotic cell is proven. In this review, we summarize how miRNAs were discovered, their biological functions, and importance in animal development, highlighting their function in proliferation, apoptosis, and cell differentiation. Furthermore, we discuss the deregulation of miRNAs in human diseases and their involvement in tumorigenesis."

        "abstract": "Development in mammals is a complex process requiring gene expression to be spatially and temporally well-regulated. Factors modulate gene functioning by controlling transcription, translation, or mRNA degradation. microRNAs (miRNAs) are a group of small RNA molecules (approximately 22 nucleotides) that attenuate gene activity posttranscriptionally by suppressing translation or destabilizing mRNAs. miRNAs have been recently validated to regulate many animal developmental events including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Many miRNAs display intriguing expression and functioning patterns throughout these pathways. Here we will review achievements to date about studies of how miRNAs affect a variety of animal developmental transitions, from the formation of early embryos to the generation of highly specialized tissues."

        "title": "MicroRNAs and cell differentiation in mammalian development.",
        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a group of recently discovered small RNAs produced by the cell using a unique process, involving RNA polymerase II, Microprocessor protein complex, and the RNAase III/Dicer endonuclease complex, and subsequently sequestered in an miRNA ribonucleoprotein complex. The biological functions of miRNAs depend on their ability to silence gene expression, primarily via degradation of the target mRNA and/or translational suppression, mediated by the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). First discovered in Caenorhabditis elegans (lin-4), miRNAs have now been identified in a wide array of organisms, including plants, zebrafish, Drosophila, and mammals. The expression of miRNAs in multicellular organisms exhibits spatiotemporal, and tissue- and cell-specificity, suggesting their involvement in tissue morphogenesis and cell differentiation. More than 200 miRNAs have been identified or predicted in mammalian cells. Recent studies have demonstrated the importance of miRNAs in embryonic stem cell differentiation, limb development, adipogenesis, myogenesis, angiogenesis and hematopoiesis, neurogenesis, and epithelial morphogenesis. Overexpression (gain-of-function) and inactivation (loss-of-function) are currently the primary approaches to studying miRNA functions. Another family of small RNAs related to miRNAs is the small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), generated by Dicer from long double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs), and produced from an induced transgene, a viral intruder, or a rogue genetic element. siRNAs silence genes via either mRNA degradation, using the RISC, or DNA methylation. siRNAs are actively being applied in basic, functional genetic studies, particularly in the generation of gene knockdown animals, as well as in gene knockdown studies of cultured cells. These studies have provided invaluable information on the specific function(s) of individual genes. siRNA technology also presents exciting potential as a therapeutic approach in disease prevention and treatment, as suggested by a recent study targeting apolipoprotein B (ApoB) in primates. Further elucidation of how miRNAs and other small RNAs interact with known and yet-to-be identified gene regulatory pathways in the cell should provide us with a more in-depth understanding of the mechanisms regulating cellular function and differentiation, and facilitate the application of small RNA technology in disease control and treatment."

        "abstract": "The discovery of the phenomenon of RNA interference (RNAi) and its existence in mammals quickly suggested a great potential for use in disease therapy. Rapid advances have been made in the development of RNAi-based technologies and promising results have been obtained from studies on mammalian cell culture systems and animal in vivo models. However, the progress in our understanding of the RNAi pathway and the related function of microRNAs (miRNAs) have also raised concerns regarding various types of side effects that may restrict the use of this technology in human therapy. At the same time, our new knowledge about the functional roles of miRNAs as regulators of many cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, development, and neuronal function, is revolutionizing cell biology and will have a major impact on medical research. In this review, we focus on the discoveries that have been made in animal models and how this insight can be translated to human medicine and disease therapy. In this connection, we will particularly discuss the challenges associated with the efforts to develop RNAi-based therapeutics."

Diverse genetic origins and biogenesis pathways leading to functional miRNAs converge on the synthesis of \u224821-nucleotide RNA duplex, almost all of which are processed from long premature sequences in a - and/or -dependent manner. Formerly, it was assumed that one mature strand of the duplex is preferentially selected for entry into the silencing complex, and the paired passenger strands (miRNA*) are subjected to degradation. However, given the consolidated evidence of substantial regulatory activity of miRNA* species, currently, this preconception has been overturned. Here, we see the caveat and opportunity toward exogenously manipulating the expression of premature miRNA, leading to simultaneous upregulation or downregulation of dual regulatory strands due to altered expressions. The caveat is the overlooked miRNA* interference while manipulating the expression of a target miRNA at the premature stage, wherein lies the opportunity. If the dual strands of a pre-miRNA function synergistically, the overlooked miRNA* interference may inversely optimize the therapeutic performance. Insightfully, targeting the premature miRNAs may serve as the \"one-two punch\" against diseases, especially cancers, and this has been discussed in detail in this review."

Here we show that single-stranded RNA oligomers of antisense polarity can also be potent inducers of gene silencing. As is the case for co-suppression, antisense RNAs act independently of the RNAi genes rde-1 and rde-4 but require the mutator/RNAi gene mut-7 and a putative DEAD box RNA helicase, mut-14. Our data favor the hypothesis that gene silencing is accomplished by RNA primer extension using the mRNA as template, leading to dsRNA that is subsequently degraded."

        "abstract": "Abiotic stress is one of the primary causes of crop losses worldwide. Much progress has been made in unraveling the complex stress response mechanisms, particularly in the identification of stress responsive protein-coding genes. In addition to protein coding genes, recently discovered microRNAs (miRNAs) and endogenous small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) have emerged as important players in plant stress responses. Initial clues suggesting that small RNAs are involved in plant stress responses stem from studies showing stress regulation of miRNAs and endogenous siRNAs, as well as from target predictions for some miRNAs. Subsequent studies have demonstrated an important functional role for these small RNAs in abiotic stress responses. This review focuses on recent advances, with emphasis on integration of small RNAs in stress regulatory networks."

        "title": "Suppression of antiviral silencing by cucumber mosaic virus 2b protein in Arabidopsis is associated with drastically reduced accumulation of three classes of viral small interfering RNAs.",
        "abstract": "We investigated the genetic pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana targeted during infection by cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) 2b protein, known to suppress non-cell-autonomous transgene silencing and salicylic acid (SA)-mediated virus resistance. We show that 2b expressed from the CMV genome drastically reduced the accumulation of 21-, 22-, and 24-nucleotide classes of viral small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) produced by Dicer-like4 (DCL4), DCL2, and DCL3, respectively. The defect of a CMV 2b-deletion mutant (CMV-Delta2b) in plant infection was efficiently rescued in Arabidopsis mutants producing neither 21- nor 22-nucleotide viral siRNAs. Since genetic analysis further identifies a unique antiviral role for DCL3 upstream of DCL4, our data indicate that inhibition of the accumulation of distinct viral siRNAs plays a key role in 2b suppression of antiviral silencing. Strikingly, disease symptoms caused by CMV-Delta2b in Arabidopsis mutants defective in antiviral silencing were as severe as those caused by CMV, demonstrating an indirect role for the silencing suppressor activity in virus virulence. We found that production of CMV siRNAs without 2b interference depended largely on RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 1 (RDR1) inducible by SA. Given the known role of RDR6-dependent transgene siRNAs in non-cell-autonomous silencing, our results suggest a model in which 2b inhibits the production of RDR1-dependent viral siRNAs that confer SA-dependent virus resistance by directing non-cell-autonomous antiviral silencing."

        "abstract": "We investigated the role of microRNAs (miRNA) 17-5p, 20a and 106a in monocytic differentiation and maturation. In unilineage monocytic culture generated by haematopoietic progenitor cells these miRNAs are downregulated, whereas the transcription factor acute myeloid leukaemia-1 (AML1; also known as Runt-related transcription factor 1, Runx1) is upregulated at protein but not mRNA level. As miRNAs 17-5p, 20a and 106a bind the AML1 mRNA 3'UTR, their decline may unblock AML1 translation. Accordingly, transfection with miRNA 17-5p-20a-106a suppresses AML1 protein expression, leading to M-CSF receptor (M-CSFR) downregulation, enhanced blast proliferation and inhibition of monocytic differentiation and maturation. Treatment with anti-miRNA 17-5p, 20a and 106a causes opposite effects. Knockdown of AML1 or M-CSFR by short interfering RNA (siRNA) mimics the action of the miRNA 17-5p-20a-106a, confirming that these miRNAs target AML1, which promotes M-CSFR transcription. In addition, AML1 binds the miRNA 17-5p-92 and 106a-92 cluster promoters and transcriptionally inhibits the expression of miRNA 17-5p-20a-106a. These studies indicate that monocytopoiesis is controlled by a circuitry involving sequentially miRNA 17-5p-20a-106a, AML1 and M-CSFR, whereby miRNA 17-5p-20a-106a function as a master gene complex interlinked with AML1 in a mutual negative feedback loop."

        "title": "Intronic microRNA precursors that bypass Drosha processing.",
        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are approximately 22-nucleotide endogenous RNAs that often repress the expression of complementary messenger RNAs. In animals, miRNAs derive from characteristic hairpins in primary transcripts through two sequential RNase III-mediated cleavages; Drosha cleaves near the base of the stem to liberate a approximately 60-nucleotide pre-miRNA hairpin, then Dicer cleaves near the loop to generate a miRNA:miRNA* duplex. From that duplex, the mature miRNA is incorporated into the silencing complex. Here we identify an alternative pathway for miRNA biogenesis, in which certain debranched introns mimic the structural features of pre-miRNAs to enter the miRNA-processing pathway without Drosha-mediated cleavage. We call these pre-miRNAs/introns 'mirtrons', and have identified 14 mirtrons in Drosophila melanogaster and another four in Caenorhabditis elegans (including the reclassification of mir-62). Some of these have been selectively maintained during evolution with patterns of sequence conservation suggesting important regulatory functions in the animal. The abundance of introns comparable in size to pre-miRNAs appears to have created a context favourable for the emergence of mirtrons in flies and nematodes. This suggests that other lineages with many similarly sized introns probably also have mirtrons, and that the mirtron pathway could have provided an early avenue for the emergence of miRNAs before the advent of Drosha."

Although considerable progress has been made in computational methods to identify miRNA targets, only a relatively limited assessment of their ability to function in vivo has been reported. Here we describe an alternative approach to miRNA target identification based on a biochemical method for purifying miRNP complexes with associated miRNAs and bound mRNA targets. Microarray analysis revealed a high degree of enrichment for miRNA complementary sites in the 3'UTRs of the miRNP-associated mRNAs. mRNAs specifically associated with an individual miRNA were identified by comparing the miRNP-associated mRNAs from wild-type flies and mutant flies lacking miR-1, and their regulation by the miRNA was validated. This approach provides a means to identify functional miRNA targets based on their physical interaction in vivo."

        "title": "Transitivity in Arabidopsis can be primed, requires the redundant action of the antiviral Dicer-like 4 and Dicer-like 2, and is compromised by viral-encoded suppressor proteins.",
        "abstract": "In plants, worms, and fungi, RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RDRs) amplify the production of short-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that mediate RNA silencing. In Arabidopsis, RDR6 is thought to copy endogenous and exogenous RNA templates into double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs), which are subsequently processed into siRNAs by one or several of the four Dicer-like enzymes (DCL1-->4). This reaction produces secondary siRNAs corresponding to sequences outside the primary targeted regions of a transcript, a phenomenon called transitivity. One recognized role of RDR6 is to strengthen the RNA silencing response mounted by plants against viruses. Accordingly, suppressor proteins deployed by viruses inhibit this defense. However, interactions between silencing suppressors and RDR6 have not yet been documented. Additionally, the mechanism underlying transitivity remains poorly understood. Here, we report how several viral silencing suppressors inhibit the RDR6-dependent amplification of virus-induced and transgene-induced gene silencing. Viral suppression of primary siRNA accumulation shows that transitivity can be initiated with minute amounts of DCL4-dependent 21-nucleotide (nt)-long siRNAs, whereas DCL3-dependent 24-nt siRNAs appear dispensable for this process. We further show that unidirectional (3-->5') transitivity requires the hierarchical and redundant functions of DCL4 and DCL2 acting downstream from RDR6 to produce 21- and 22-nt-long siRNAs, respectively. The 3-->5' transitive reaction is likely to be processive over >750 nt, with secondary siRNA production progressively decreasing as the reaction proceeds toward the 5'-proximal region of target transcripts. Finally, we show that target cleavage by a primary small RNA and 3-->5' transitivity can be genetically uncoupled, and we provide in vivo evidence supporting a key role for priming in this specific reaction."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are key posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression involved in diverse biological pathways in bilateral animals and plants. The key to understanding the biological function of a miRNA is to identify its regulatory targets. Although a few miRNA targets have been identified genetically, the rapidly expanding list of miRNAs has necessitated genome-wide tools for identifying target mRNAs, and a number of computational and experimental approaches have consequently emerged. Some of these approaches have also provided insights into the mechanistic aspects of miRNA-mediated regulation, another intensely debated area in the miRNA field. Here, we review several emerging features of miRNA-target interactions in animals and genome-wide approaches for probing those interactions."

        "title": "MicroRNAs and toll-like receptor/interleukin-1 receptor signaling.",
        "abstract": "The discovery of miRNAs has revolutionized the way we examine the genome, RNA products, and the regulation of transcription and translation. Their ability to modulate protein expression through mRNA degradation and translation repression resulted in avid scientific interest in miRNAs over the past decade. This research has led to findings that indicate miRNAs can regulate an array of cellular functions such as cellular apoptosis, proliferation, differentiation, and metabolism. Specifically, the capability of miRNAs to finely-tune gene expression naturally lends itself to immune system regulation which requires precise control for proper activity. In fact, abnormal miRNAs expression is often seen with inflammatory disorders like rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erthematosus, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, and inflammatory cancers. As a result, research investigating miRNAs modulation of immune cell proliferation, differentiation, and cellular signaling has yielded fruitful results. Specifically, in this review, we will examine the impact of miRNAs on toll-like receptor (TLRs) and interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) signaling, which are integral in the proper functioning of the innate immune system. These signaling pathways share several key downstream signaling adaptors and therefore produce similar downstream effects such as the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and interferons. This review will examine in depth the specific interactions of miRNAs with receptors, adaptor molecules, and regulator molecules within these cellular pathways. In addition, we will discuss the modulation of miRNAs' expression by TLR and IL-1R signaling through positive and negative feedback loops."

        "title": "Therapeutic silencing of miR-10b inhibits metastasis in a mouse mammary tumor model.",
        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are increasingly implicated in the regulation of metastasis. Despite their potential as targets for anti-metastatic therapy, miRNAs have only been silenced in normal tissues of rodents and nonhuman primates. Therefore, the development of effective approaches for sequence-specific inhibition of miRNAs in tumors remains a scientific and clinical challenge. Here we show that systemic treatment of tumor-bearing mice with miR-10b antagomirs-a class of chemically modified anti-miRNA oligonucleotide-suppresses breast cancer metastasis. Both in vitro and in vivo, silencing of miR-10b with antagomirs significantly decreases miR-10b levels and increases the levels of a functionally important miR-10b target, Hoxd10. Administration of miR-10b antagomirs to mice bearing highly metastatic cells does not reduce primary mammary tumor growth but markedly suppresses formation of lung metastases in a sequence-specific manner. The miR-10b antagomir, which is well tolerated by normal animals, appears to be a promising candidate for the development of new anti-metastasis agents."

        "title": "MicroRNAs and their role in gynecological tumors.",
        "abstract": "There have been only few events in the history of molecular biology that could be compared to the discovery of microRNAs and their role in cell physiology and pathology. MicroRNAs are small, single-stranded, noncoding RNAs composed of 19-25 nucleotides (\u223c22 nt), which have been proven to regulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level. The regulatory function of microRNAs was demonstrated in normal and diseased conditions. In particular, it has been linked to cell cycle regulation, cell proliferation and differentiation, inflammatory response, and apoptosis. Altered expression profiles of microRNA have been observed in many pathologies, including diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and several cancers. To date, more than 700 human microRNAs have been identified and in silico-based analyses estimate at least 500 more to be identified. The purpose of this review is to present the current perspective on microRNAs structure and biogenesis as well as their contribution to the etiopathogenesis of gynecological tumors. We discuss results of the recent publications that indicate possibilities of microRNAs use as novel markers for tumors screening, early diagnosis, and treatment monitoring. The possible utilization of microRNAs as prognostic factors and specific therapy targets is also reviewed."

        "title": "Micromarkers: miRNAs in cancer diagnosis and prognosis.",
        "abstract": "Molecular diagnostics in cancer should provide the highest specificity and sensitivity in classification, prognostic stratification and early detection. miRNAs could contribute to hitting the mark, or at least to come nearer, by virtue of their cancer-specific expression and stability. Indeed, different to other RNA classes, miRNAs can be detected and quantified not only in frozen tissues, but also in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues, as well as serum/plasma samples. Thus, miRNA studies have quickly moved from research on the molecular basis of cancer to areas of clinical application. This review summarizes the potential role of miRNAs as molecular markers for cancer classification, prognostic stratification and drug-response prediction. It also summarizes their potential as circulating markers and cancer-predisposing genes. If we consider that studies on miRNAs in cancer therapy have already given important contributions, miRNAs have an impact in all cancer areas. Whether this will translate into clinical applications is still too early to say. However, in the diagnostic field, miRNAs may already represent an improvement over presently available approaches; for example, their expression profile is effective in the identification of tissue of origin of metastasis. In addition, circulating miRNAs are expected to provide improved specificity and/or sensitivity over presently available markers."

        "abstract": "RNA transcripts are subject to posttranscriptional gene regulation involving hundreds of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and microRNA-containing ribonucleoprotein complexes (miRNPs) expressed in a cell-type dependent fashion. We developed a cell-based crosslinking approach to determine at high resolution and transcriptome-wide the binding sites of cellular RBPs and miRNPs. The crosslinked sites are revealed by thymidine to cytidine transitions in the cDNAs prepared from immunopurified RNPs of 4-thiouridine-treated cells. We determined the binding sites and regulatory consequences for several intensely studied RBPs and miRNPs, including PUM2, QKI, IGF2BP1-3, AGO/EIF2C1-4 and TNRC6A-C. Our study revealed that these factors bind thousands of sites containing defined sequence motifs and have distinct preferences for exonic versus intronic or coding versus untranslated transcript regions. The precise mapping of binding sites across the transcriptome will be critical to the interpretation of the rapidly emerging data on genetic variation between individuals and how these variations contribute to complex genetic diseases."

        "title": "The code within the code: microRNAs target coding regions.",
        "abstract": "The coding sequence of a protein must contain the information required for the canonical amino acid sequence. However, the redundancy of the genetic code creates potential for embedding other types of information within coding regions as well. In a genome-wide computational screen for functional motifs within coding regions based on evolutionary conservation, highly conserved motifs included some expected motifs, some novel motifs and coding region target sites for known microRNAs, which are generally presumed to target 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) (www.SiteSifter.org). We report here an analysis of published proteomics experiments that further support a functional role for coding region microRNA binding sites, though the effects are weaker than for sites in the 3' UTR. We also demonstrate a positional bias with greater conservation for sites at the end of the coding region, and the beginning and end of the 3' UTR. An increased effectiveness of microRNA binding sites at the 3' end of transcripts could reflect proximity to the poly(A) tail or interactions with the 5' terminal 7mGpppN \"cap\", which is physically adjacent to this region once the message is circularized. The effectiveness of 3' UTR sites could reflect a cooperative role for RNA binding proteins. Finally, increased microRNA conservation near the stop codon suggests to us the possible involvement of proteins that execute nonsense-mediated decay, since this process is activated by tagging of termination codons with factors that induce transcript degradation."

        "title": "MicroRNAs act sequentially and asymmetrically to control chemosensory laterality in the nematode.",
        "abstract": "Animal microRNAs (miRNAs) are gene regulatory factors that prevent the expression of specific messenger RNA targets by binding to their 3' untranslated region. The Caenorhabditis elegans lsy-6 miRNA (for lateral symmetry defective) is required for the left/right asymmetric expression of guanyl cyclase (gcy) genes in two chemosensory neurons termed ASE left (ASEL) and ASE right (ASER). The asymmetric expression of these putative chemoreceptors in turn correlates with the functional lateralization of the ASE neurons. Here we find that a mutation in the die-1 zinc-finger transcription factor disrupts both the chemosensory laterality and left/right asymmetric expression of chemoreceptor genes in the ASE neurons. die-1 controls chemosensory laterality by activating the expression of lsy-6 specifically in ASEL, but not in ASER, where die-1 expression is downregulated through two sites in its 3' untranslated region. These two sites are complementary to mir-273, a previously uncharacterized miRNA, whose expression is strongly biased towards ASER. Forced bilateral expression of mir-273 in ASEL and ASER causes a loss of asymmetric die-1 expression and ASE laterality. Thus, an inverse distribution of two sequentially acting miRNAs in two bilaterally symmetric neurons controls laterality of the nematode chemosensory system."

        "abstract": "microRNAs (or miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs (21 to 25 nucleotides) that are processed from longer hairpin RNA precursors and are believed to be involved in a wide range of developmental and cellular processes, by either repressing translation or triggering mRNA degradation (RNA interference). By using a computer-assisted approach, we have identified 46 potential miRNA genes located in the human imprinted 14q32 domain, 40 of which are organized as a large cluster. Although some of these clustered miRNA genes appear to be encoded by a single-copy DNA sequence, most of them are arranged in tandem arrays of closely related sequences. In the mouse, this miRNA gene cluster is conserved at the homologous distal 12 region. In vivo all the miRNAs that we have detected are expressed in the developing embryo (both in the head and in the trunk) and in the placenta, whereas in the adult their expression is mainly restricted to the brain. We also show that the miRNA genes are only expressed from the maternally inherited chromosome and that their imprinted expression is regulated by an intergenic germline-derived differentially methylated region (IG-DMR) located approximately 200 kb upstream from the miRNA cluster. The functions of these miRNAs, which seem only conserved in mammals, are discussed both in terms of epigenetic control and gene regulation during development."

        "title": "Arabidopsis micro-RNA biogenesis through Dicer-like 1 protein functions.",
        "abstract": "Micro-RNAs (miRNAs) are small, noncoding RNAs of 18-25 nt in length that negatively regulate their complementary mRNAs at the posttranscriptional level. Previous work has shown that some RNase III-like enzymes such as Drosha and Dicer are known to be involved in miRNA biogenesis in animals. However, the mechanism of plant miRNA biogenesis still remains poorly understood. In this article, the process of Arabidopsis miR163 biogenesis was examined. The results revealed that two types of miR163 primary transcripts (pri-miR163s) are transcribed from a single gene by RNA polymerase II and that miR163 biogenesis requires at least three cleavage steps by RNase III-like enzymes at 21-nt-long intervals. The first step is from pri-miR163 to long miR163 precursor (premiR163), the second step is from long pre-miR163 to short premiR163, and the last step is from short pre-miR163 to mature miR163 and the remnant. It is interesting that, during the process, four small RNAs including miR163 are released. By using dcl1 mutants, it was demonstrated that Arabidopsis Dicer homologue Dicer-like 1 (DCL1) catalyzes at least the first and second cleavage steps and that double-stranded RNA-binding domains of DCL1 are involved in positioning of the cleavage sites. Our result is direct evidence that DCL1 is involved in processing of pri- and pre-miRNA."

        "title": "Patterns of flanking sequence conservation and a characteristic upstream motif for microRNA gene identification.",
        "abstract": "MicroRNAs are approximately 22-nucleotide (nt) RNAs processed from foldback segments of endogenous transcripts. Some are known to play important gene regulatory roles during animal and plant development by pairing to the messages of protein-coding genes to direct the post-transcriptional repression of these messages. Previously, we developed a computational method called MiRscan, which scores features related to the foldbacks, and used this algorithm to identify new miRNA genes in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. In the present study, to identify sequences that might be involved in processing or transcriptional regulation of miRNAs, we aligned sequences upstream and downstream of orthologous nematode miRNA foldbacks. These alignments showed a pronounced peak in sequence conservation about 200 bp upstream of the miRNA foldback and revealed a highly significant sequence motif, with consensus CTCCGCCC, that is present upstream of almost all independently transcribed nematode miRNA genes. Scoring the pattern of upstream/downstream conservation, the occurrence of this sequence motif, and orthology of host genes for intronic miRNA candidates, yielded substantial improvements in the accuracy of MiRscan. Nine new C. elegans miRNA gene candidates were validated using a PCR-sequencing protocol. As previously seen for bacterial RNA genes, sequence features outside of the RNA secondary structure can therefore be very useful for the computational identification of eukaryotic noncoding RNA genes. The total number of confidently identified nematode miRNAs now approaches 100. The improved analysis supports our previous assertion that miRNA gene identification is nearing completion in C. elegans with apparently no more than 20 miRNA genes now remaining to be identified."

        "abstract": "Gene silencing by small RNAs (sRNAs) occurs in all three domains of life. In recent years, our appreciation of the diverse functions of sRNAs has increased, and we have identified roles for these RNAs in cellular differentiation, fitness and pathogen defence. Interestingly, although plants, nematodes and arthropods use sRNAs to combat viral infections, chordates have replaced this defence strategy with one based exclusively on proteins. This limits chordate use of sRNAs to the silencing of genome-encoded transcripts and has resulted in viruses that do not perturb sRNA-related cellular processes. This evolutionary phenomenon provides an opportunity to exploit the pre-existing chordate sRNA pathways in order to generate a range of virus-based biological tools. Here, I discuss the relationship between sRNAs and RNA viruses, detail how microRNA expression can be harnessed to control RNA viruses and describe how RNA viruses can be designed to deliver sRNAs."

        "abstract": "To use microRNAs to downregulate mRNA targets, cells must first process these ~22 nt RNAs from primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs). These transcripts form RNA hairpins important for processing, but additional determinants must distinguish pri-miRNAs from the many other hairpin-containing transcripts expressed in each cell. Illustrating the complexity of this recognition, we show that most Caenorhabditis elegans pri-miRNAs lack determinants required for processing in human cells. To find these determinants, we generated many variants of four human pri-miRNAs, sequenced millions that retained function, and compared them with the starting variants. Our results confirmed the importance of pairing in the stem and revealed three primary-sequence determinants, including an SRp20-binding motif (CNNC) found downstream of most pri-miRNA hairpins in bilaterian animals, but not in nematodes. Adding this and other determinants to C. elegans pri-miRNAs imparted efficient processing in human cells, thereby confirming the importance of primary-sequence determinants for distinguishing pri-miRNAs from other hairpin-containing transcripts."

        "abstract": "ARGONAUTE1 (AGO1) of Arabidopsis thaliana mediates the cleavage of microRNA (miRNA)-targeted mRNAs, and it has also been implicated in the posttranscriptional silencing of transgenes and the maintenance of chromatin structure. Mutations in AGO1 severely disrupt plant development, indicating that miRNA function and possibly other aspects of RNA interference are essential for maintaining normal patterns of gene expression. Using microarrays, we found that 1 to 6% of genes display significant expression changes in several alleles of ago1 at multiple developmental stages, with the majority showing higher levels. Several classes of known miRNA targets increased markedly in ago1, whereas others showed little or no change. Cleavage of mRNAs within miRNA-homologous sites was reduced but not abolished in an ago1 -null background, indicating that redundant slicer activity exists in Arabidopsis. Small interfering RNAs and larger 30- to 60-nucleotide RNA fragments corresponding to highly upregulated miRNA target genes accumulated in wild-type plants but not in ago1, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase mutants rdr2 and rdr6, or the Dicer-like mutants dcl1 and dcl3. Both sense and antisense RNAs corresponding to these miRNA targets accumulated in the ago1 and dcl1 backgrounds. These results indicate that a subset of endogenous mRNA targets of RNA interference may be regulated through a mechanism of second-strand RNA synthesis and degradation initiated by or in addition to miRNA-mediated cleavage."

Whereas small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) derive from both the sense and antisense strands of their double-stranded RNA precursors, rasiRNAs arise mainly from the antisense strand. rasiRNA production appears not to require Dicer-1, which makes microRNAs (miRNAs), or Dicer-2, which makes siRNAs, and rasiRNAs lack the 2',3' hydroxy termini characteristic of animal siRNA and miRNA. Unlike siRNAs and miRNAs, rasiRNAs function through the Piwi, rather than the Ago, Argonaute protein subfamily. Our data suggest that rasiRNAs protect the fly germline through a silencing mechanism distinct from both the miRNA and RNA interference pathways."

        "abstract": "Plants contain more DICER-LIKE (DCL) enzymes and double-stranded RNA binding (DRB) proteins than other eukaryotes, resulting in increased small RNA network complexities. Analyses of single, double, triple and quadruple dcl mutants exposed DCL1 as a sophisticated enzyme capable of producing both microRNAs (miRNAs) and siRNAs, unlike the three other DCLs, which only produce siRNAs. Depletion of siRNA-specific DCLs results in unbalanced small RNA levels, indicating a redeployment of DCL/DRB complexes. In particular, DCL2 antagonizes the production of miRNAs and siRNAs by DCL1 in certain circumstances and affects development deleteriously in dcl1 dcl4 and dcl1 dcl3 dcl4 mutant plants, whereas dcl1 dcl2 dcl3 dcl4 quadruple mutant plants are viable. We also show that viral siRNAs are produced by DCL4, and that DCL2 can substitute for DCL4 when this latter activity is reduced or inhibited by viruses, pointing to the competitiveness of DCL2. Given the complexity of the small RNA repertoire in plants, the implication of each DCL, in particular DCL2, in the production of small RNAs that have no known function will constitute one of the next challenges."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) silence the expression of target genes post-transcriptionally. Their function is mediated by the Argonaute proteins (AGOs), which colocalize to P-bodies with mRNA degradation enzymes. Mammalian P-bodies are also marked by the GW182 protein, which interacts with the AGOs and is required for miRNA function. We show that depletion of GW182 leads to changes in mRNA expression profiles strikingly similar to those observed in cells depleted of the essential Drosophila miRNA effector AGO1, indicating that GW182 functions in the miRNA pathway. When GW182 is bound to a reporter transcript, it silences its expression, bypassing the requirement for AGO1. Silencing by GW182 is effected by changes in protein expression and mRNA stability. Similarly, miRNAs silence gene expression by repressing protein expression and/or by promoting mRNA decay, and both mechanisms require GW182. mRNA degradation, but not translational repression, by GW182 or miRNAs is inhibited in cells depleted of CAF1, NOT1, or the decapping DCP1:DCP2 complex. We further show that the N-terminal GW repeats of GW182 interact with the PIWI domain of AGO1. Our findings indicate that GW182 links the miRNA pathway to mRNA degradation by interacting with AGO1 and promoting decay of at least a subset of miRNA targets."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a group of small non-coding RNA molecules of 17-25 nucleotides (nt) in length, predicted to control the activity of about 30% of all protein-coding genes in mammals. Altered expressions of miRNAs are reported in various cancers and may associate with cancer pathogenesis, apoptosis, and cell growth, thereby functioning as either tumor suppressors or oncogenes. Recent reports showed that deregulation of miRNA contribute to tumor development and progression and hence, have diagnostic and prognostic value in several human malignancies. This review discusses the current status of miRNA in pancreatic cancer development, progression, diagnosis, and therapy."

        "abstract": "The miR-17 approximately 92 cluster is frequently amplified or overexpressed in human cancers and has emerged as the prototypical oncogenic polycistron microRNA (miRNA). miR-17 approximately 92 is a direct transcriptional target of c-Myc, and experiments in a mouse model of B-cell lymphomas have shown cooperation between these two oncogenes. However, both the molecular mechanism underlying this cooperation and the individual miRNAs that are responsible for it are unknown. By using a conditional knockout allele of miR-17 approximately 92, we show here that sustained expression of endogenous miR-17 approximately 92 is required to suppress apoptosis in Myc-driven B-cell lymphomas. Furthermore, we show that among the six miRNAs that are encoded by miR-17 approximately 92, miR-19a and miR-19b are absolutely required and largely sufficient to recapitulate the oncogenic properties of the entire cluster. Finally, by combining computational target prediction, gene expression profiling, and an in vitro screening strategy, we identify a subset of miR-19 targets that mediate its prosurvival activity."

        "abstract": "Recent studies have revealed the importance of multiple microRNAs (miRNAs) in promoting tumorigenesis, among which mir-17-92/Oncomir-1 exhibits potent oncogenic activity. Genomic amplification and elevated expression of mir-17-92 occur in several human B-cell lymphomas, and enforced mir-17-92 expression in mice cooperates with c-myc to promote the formation of B-cell lymphomas. Unlike classic protein-coding oncogenes, mir-17-92 has an unconventional gene structure, where one primary transcript yields six individual miRNAs. Here, we functionally dissected the individual components of mir-17-92 by assaying their tumorigenic potential in vivo. Using the Emu-myc model of mouse B-cell lymphoma, we identified miR-19 as the key oncogenic component of mir-17-92, both necessary and sufficient for promoting c-myc-induced lymphomagenesis by repressing apoptosis. The oncogenic activity of miR-19 is at least in part due to its repression of the tumor suppressor Pten. Consistently, miR-19 activates the Akt-mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway, thereby functionally antagonizing Pten to promote cell survival. Our findings reveal the essential role of miR-19 in mediating the oncogenic activity of mir-17-92, and implicate the functional diversity of mir-17-92 components as the molecular basis for its pleiotropic effects during tumorigenesis."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding, double-stranded RNA molecules that can mediate the expression of target genes with complementary sequences. About 5,300 human genes have been implicated as targets for miRNAs, making them one of the most abundant classes of regulatory genes in humans. MiRNAs recognize their target mRNAs based on sequence complementarity and act on them to cause the inhibition of protein translation by degradation of mRNA. Besides contributing to development and normal function, microRNAs have functions in various human diseases. Given the importance of miRNAs in regulating cellular differentiation and proliferation, it is not surprising that their misregulation is linked to cancer. In cancer, miRNAs function as regulatory molecules, acting as oncogenes or tumor suppressors. Amplification or overexpression of miRNAs can down-regulate tumor suppressors or other genes involved in cell differentiation, thereby contributing to tumor formation by stimulating proliferation, angiogenesis, and invasion; i.e., they act as oncogenes. Similarly, miRNAs can down-regulate different proteins with oncogenic activity; i.e., they act as tumor suppressors. This review will highlight the recent discoveries regarding miRNAs and their importance in cancer."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are one class of tiny, endogenous RNAs that can regulate messenger RNA (mRNA) expression by targeting homologous sequences in mRNAs. Their aberrant expressions have been observed in many cancers and several miRNAs have been convincingly shown to play important roles in carcinogenesis. Since the discovery of this small regulator, computational methods have been indispensable tools in miRNA gene finding and functional studies. In this review we first briefly outline the biological findings of miRNA genes, such as genomic feature, biogenesis, gene structure, and functional mechanism. We then discuss in detail the three main aspects of miRNA computational studies: miRNA gene finding, miRNA target prediction, and regulation of miRNA genes. Finally, we provide perspectives on some emerging issues, including combinatorial regulation by miRNAs and functional binding sites beyond the 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR) of target mRNAs. Available online resources for miRNA computational studies are also provided."

        "abstract": "microRNAs (miRNAs) are short RNAs that regulate gene expression in eukaryotes. The biogenesis and turnover of miRNAs determine their spatiotemporal accumulation within tissues. miRNA biogenesis is a multistep process that entails transcription, processing, nuclear export, and formation of the miRNA-ARGONAUTE complex. Factors that perform each of these steps have been identified. Generation of mature miRNAs from primary transcripts, i.e., miRNA processing, is a key step in miRNA biogenesis. Our understanding of miRNA processing has expanded beyond the enzyme that performs the reactions, as more and more additional factors that impact the efficiency and accuracy of miRNA processing are uncovered. In contrast to miRNA biogenesis, miRNA turnover is an important but poorly understood process that contributes to the steady-state levels of miRNAs. Enzymes responsible for miRNA degradation have only recently been identified. This review describes the processes of miRNA maturation and degradation in plants."

It is believed that miRNAs are modulators of target mRNA translation and stability, although most target mRNAs remain to be identified. Here we describe the identification of 34 novel miRNAs by tissue-specific cloning of approximately 21-nucleotide RNAs from mouse. Almost all identified miRNAs are conserved in the human genome and are also frequently found in nonmammalian vertebrate genomes, such as pufferfish. In heart, liver, or brain, it is found that a single, tissue-specifically expressed miRNA dominates the population of expressed miRNAs and suggests a role for these miRNAs in tissue specification or cell lineage decisions. Finally, a miRNA was identified that appears to be the fruitfly and mammalian ortholog of C. elegans lin-4 stRNA."

RNAi is characterized by the conversion of long dsRNA into approximately 21-25-nt small interfering RNAs (siRNA) that guide the degradation of homologous mRNA. Many of the genes required for siRNA production and target mRNA degradation are widely conserved. Notably, members of the Argonaute-like gene family from Arabidopsis, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila, and Neurospora have been genetically and/or biochemically identified as components of the RNAi/cosuppression pathway. We show here that mutations in the Drosophila Argonaute1 (AGO1) gene suppress RNAi in embryos. This defect corresponds to a reduced ability to degrade mRNA in response to dsRNA in vitro. Furthermore, AGO1 is not required for siRNA production in vitro nor can the introduction of siRNA bypass AGO1 mutants in vivo. These data suggest that AGO1 functions downstream of siRNA production."

        "title": "Outside the coding genome, mammalian microRNAs confer structural and functional complexity.",
        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) comprise a class of small, regulatory noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) with pivotal roles in posttranscriptional gene regulation. Since their initial discovery in 1993, numerous miRNAs have been identified in mammalian genomes, many of which play important roles in diverse cellular processes in development and disease. These small ncRNAs regulate the expression of many protein-coding genes posttranscriptionally, thus adding a substantial complexity to the molecular networks underlying physiological development and disease. In part, this complexity arises from the distinct gene structures, the extensive genomic redundancy, and the complex regulation of the expression and biogenesis of miRNAs. These characteristics contribute to the functional robustness and versatility of miRNAs and provide important clues to the functional significance of these small ncRNAs. The unique structure and function of miRNAs will continue to inspire many to explore the vast noncoding genome and to elucidate the molecular basis for the functional complexity of mammalian genomes."

        "abstract": "In Arabidopsis thaliana, four different dicer-like (DCL) proteins have distinct but partially overlapping functions in the biogenesis of microRNAs (miRNAs) and siRNAs from longer, noncoding precursor RNAs. To analyze the impact of different components of the small RNA biogenesis machinery on the transcriptome, we subjected dcl and other mutants impaired in small RNA biogenesis to whole-genome tiling array analysis. We compared both protein-coding genes and noncoding transcripts, including most pri-miRNAs, in two tissues and several stress conditions. Our analysis revealed a surprising number of common targets in dcl1 and dcl2 dcl3 dcl4 triple mutants. Furthermore, our results suggest that the DCL1 is not only involved in miRNA action but also contributes to silencing of a subset of transposons, apparently through an effect on DNA methylation."

        "abstract": "Hyperactivity of the Myc oncogenic transcription factor dramatically reprograms gene expression to facilitate cellular proliferation and tumorigenesis. To elicit these effects, Myc coordinates the activation and repression of an extensive network of protein-coding genes and, as has recently been appreciated, noncoding RNAs including microRNAs (miRNAs). Consistent with their ability to potently influence cancer phenotypes, the regulation of miRNAs by Myc affects virtually all aspects of the Myc oncogenic program, including proliferation, survival, metabolism, angiogenesis, and metastasis. This review will summarize the current understanding of the mechanisms underlying Myc-dependent transcriptional and posttranscriptional control of miRNAs and the resultant effects on tumorigenesis. As miRNAs are integral nodes in the transcriptional network controlled by Myc, modulating their activity represents a promising new approach for cancer therapy."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are evolutionarily conserved small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression. Early studies have shown that miRNA expression is deregulated in cancer and experimental data indicate that cancer phenotypes can be modified by targeting miRNA expression. Based on these observations, miRNA-based anticancer therapies are being developed, either alone or in combination with current targeted therapies, with the goal to improve disease response and increase cure rates. The advantage of using miRNA approaches is based on its ability to concurrently target multiple effectors of pathways involved in cell differentiation, proliferation and survival. In this Review, we describe the role of miRNAs in tumorigenesis and critically discuss the rationale, the strategies and the challenges for the therapeutic targeting of miRNAs in cancer."

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short, noncoding, and single-stranded RNA molecules that negatively regulate gene expression. They are evolutionarily conserved from plants to animals. During the last decade, miRNAs have been demonstrated as regulators in fundamental biological processes, including cell growth, proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. By base pairing to the complementary sites in the mRNA of the target gene, miRNA can lead to repression of protein translation or cleavage of mRNA. Among over 700 miRNAs identified in the human genome, several of them were confirmed as 'oncomirs', which denote miRNAs associated with initiation and progression of cancers. Generally, depending on their target genes, these miRNAs function as tumor suppressors or oncogenes. However, the miR-17-92 cluster in the human genome, which encodes 7 mature microRNAs, has been validated as regulator showing both oncogenic and tumor suppressive properties. The miR-17-92 cluster targets mRNAs involved in distinct pathways so that it may exert opposing effects. The transcription factors E2Fs and c-Myc, which play critical roles in tumorigenesis, could interact with the cluster. The feedback loops, which are comprised of the transcription factors and the miR-17-92 cluster, weave a complex regulation net work of cancers. The duality of this cluster reflects the complexities of cancer progressions as well as the intricacies of the regulation network of miRNAs and their targets. With the help of the development of new experimental methods and bioinformatics, further researches on the miR-17-92 cluster and other oncomirs will give new insights into cancer diagnosis, therapy, and prognosis."

Interest in the cluster and its members has been increasing steadily and the number of publications has grown exponentially since its discovery with more than 1000 articles published in 2012 alone. Originally found to be involved in tumorigenesis, research work in recent years has uncovered unexpected roles for its members in a wide variety of settings that include normal development, immune diseases, cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative diseases and aging. In light of its ever-increasing importance and ever-widening regulatory roles, we review here the latest body of knowledge on the cluster's involvement in health and disease as well as provide a novel perspective on the full spectrum of protein-coding and non-coding transcripts that are likely regulated by its members."

        "abstract": "Cancer progression has similarities with the process of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) found during embryonic development, during which cells down-regulate E-cadherin and up-regulate Vimentin expression. By evaluating the expression of 207 microRNAs (miRNAs) in the 60 cell lines of the drug screening panel maintained by the Nation Cancer Institute, we identified the miR-200 miRNA family as an extraordinary marker for cells that express E-cadherin but lack expression of Vimentin. These findings were extended to primary ovarian cancer specimens. miR-200 was found to directly target the mRNA of the E-cadherin transcriptional repressors ZEB1 (TCF8/deltaEF1) and ZEB2 (SMAD-interacting protein 1 [SIP1]/ZFXH1B). Ectopic expression of miR-200 caused up-regulation of E-cadherin in cancer cell lines and reduced their motility. Conversely, inhibition of miR-200 reduced E-cadherin expression, increased expression of Vimentin, and induced EMT. Our data identify miR-200 as a powerful marker and determining factor of the epithelial phenotype of cancer cells."

Transcription factor-mediated regulation of mRNA is clearly a major source of regulatory control and has been well studied. The more recent discovery of small RNAs as key regulators of gene function has introduced a new level and mechanism of regulation. Mammalian genomes contain hundreds of microRNAs (miRNAs) that each can potentially downregulate many target genes. This suggests a new source for broad control over gene regulation and has inspired extensive interest in defining miRNAs and their functions. Here, the identification of miRNAs, their biogenesis, and some examples of miRNA effects on biology and disease are reviewed and discussed. Emphasis is placed on the possible role for miRNA in nervous system development, function, and disease."

However, the identification of miRNAs from the large pool of sequenced transcripts from a single deep sequencing run remains a major challenge.

We demonstrate its accuracy and robustness using published Caenorhabditis elegans data and data we generated by deep sequencing human and dog RNAs. miRDeep reports altogether approximately 230 previously unannotated miRNAs, of which four novel C. elegans miRNAs are validated by northern blot analysis."

        "abstract": "Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) direct RNA interference (RNAi) in eukaryotes. In flies, somatic cells produce siRNAs from exogenous double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) as a defense against viral infection. We identified endogenous siRNAs (endo-siRNAs), 21 nucleotides in length, that correspond to transposons and heterochromatic sequences in the somatic cells of Drosophila melanogaster. We also detected endo-siRNAs complementary to messenger RNAs (mRNAs); these siRNAs disproportionately mapped to the complementary regions of overlapping mRNAs predicted to form double-stranded RNA in vivo. Normal accumulation of somatic endo-siRNAs requires the siRNA-generating ribonuclease Dicer-2 and the RNAi effector protein Argonaute2 (Ago2). We propose that endo-siRNAs generated by the fly RNAi pathway silence selfish genetic elements in the soma, much as Piwi-interacting RNAs do in the germ line."

        "title": "Pseudogene-derived small interfering RNAs regulate gene expression in mouse oocytes.",
        "abstract": "Pseudogenes populate the mammalian genome as remnants of artefactual incorporation of coding messenger RNAs into transposon pathways. Here we show that a subset of pseudogenes generates endogenous small interfering RNAs (endo-siRNAs) in mouse oocytes. These endo-siRNAs are often processed from double-stranded RNAs formed by hybridization of spliced transcripts from protein-coding genes to antisense transcripts from homologous pseudogenes. An inverted repeat pseudogene can also generate abundant small RNAs directly. A second class of endo-siRNAs may enforce repression of mobile genetic elements, acting together with Piwi-interacting RNAs. Loss of Dicer, a protein integral to small RNA production, increases expression of endo-siRNA targets, demonstrating their regulatory activity. Our findings indicate a function for pseudogenes in regulating gene expression by means of the RNA interference pathway and may, in part, explain the evolutionary pressure to conserve argonaute-mediated catalysis in mammals."

        "title": "Endogenous siRNAs from naturally formed dsRNAs regulate transcripts in mouse oocytes.",
        "abstract": "RNA interference (RNAi) is a mechanism by which double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) suppress specific transcripts in a sequence-dependent manner. dsRNAs are processed by Dicer to 21-24-nucleotide small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and then incorporated into the argonaute (Ago) proteins. Gene regulation by endogenous siRNAs has been observed only in organisms possessing RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP). In mammals, where no RdRP activity has been found, biogenesis and function of endogenous siRNAs remain largely unknown. Here we show, using mouse oocytes, that endogenous siRNAs are derived from naturally occurring dsRNAs and have roles in the regulation of gene expression. By means of deep sequencing, we identify a large number of both approximately 25-27-nucleotide Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) and approximately 21-nucleotide siRNAs corresponding to messenger RNAs or retrotransposons in growing oocytes. piRNAs are bound to Mili and have a role in the regulation of retrotransposons. siRNAs are exclusively mapped to retrotransposons or other genomic regions that produce transcripts capable of forming dsRNA structures. Inverted repeat structures, bidirectional transcription and antisense transcripts from various loci are sources of the dsRNAs. Some precursor transcripts of siRNAs are derived from expressed pseudogenes, indicating that one role of pseudogenes is to adjust the level of the founding source mRNA through RNAi. Loss of Dicer or Ago2 results in decreased levels of siRNAs and increased levels of retrotransposon and protein-coding transcripts complementary to the siRNAs. Thus, the RNAi pathway regulates both protein-coding transcripts and retrotransposons in mouse oocytes. Our results reveal a role for endogenous siRNAs in mammalian oocytes and show that organisms lacking RdRP activity can produce functional endogenous siRNAs from naturally occurring dsRNAs."

        "title": "Interspecies regulation of microRNAs and their targets.",
        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are 20-24 nucleotide RNA molecules that play essential roles in posttranscriptional regulation of target genes. In animals, miRNAs bind to target mRNA through imperfect complementary sequences that are usually located at the 3' untranslated regions (UTRs), leading to translational repression or transcript degradation. In plants, miRNAs predominately mediate degradation of target mRNAs via perfect or near-perfect complementary sequences. MicroRNA targets include a large number of transcription factors, suggesting a role of miRNAs in the control of regulatory networks and cellular growth and development. Many miRNAs and their targets are conserved among plants or animals, whereas some are specific to a few plant or animal lineages. Conserved miRNAs do not necessarily exhibit the same expression levels or patterns in different species or at different stages within a species. Therefore, sequence and expression divergence in miRNAs between species may affect miRNA accumulation and target regulation in interspecific hybrids and allopolyploids that contain two or more divergent genomes, leading to developmental changes and phenotypic variation in the new species."

        "title": "RARs and microRNAs.",
        "abstract": "MicroRNA MicroRNA s (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs acting as endogenous regulators of gene expression. Their discovery is one of the major recent breakthroughs in molecular biology. miRNAs establish a multiplicity of relationships with target mRNAs and exert pleiotropic biological effects in many cell physiological pathways during development and adult life. The dynamic nature of gene expression regulation by Retinoic Acid Retinoic acid (RA) is consistent with an extensive functional interplay with miRNA activities. In fact, RA regulates the expression of many different miRNAs, thus suggesting a relevant function of miRNAs in RA-controlled gene expression programmes. miRNAs have been extensively studied as targets and mediators of the biological activity of RA during embryonic development as well as in normal and neoplastic cells. However, relatively few studies have experimentally explored the direct contribution of miRNA function to the RA signalling pathway. Here, we provide an overview of the mechanistic aspects that allow miRNA biogenesis, functional activation and regulation, focusing on recent evidence that highlights a functional interplay between miRNAs and RA-regulated molecular networks. We report examples of tissue-specific roles of miRNAs modulated by RA in stem cell pluripotency maintenance and regeneration, embryonic development, hematopoietic and neural differentiation, and other biological model systems, underlining their role in disease pathogenesis. We also address novel areas of research linking the RA signalling pathway to the nuclear activity of miRNAs."
